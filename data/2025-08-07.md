Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [2] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了基于极坐标的离群点检测算法（PCOD），用于提高噪声点对圆拟合算法的影响。该方法通过将点集转换为极坐标并计算局部和全局标准差以检测离群点，显示出在工业圆拟合应用中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有圆拟合算法在面对噪声数据时准确性下降，为此需要有效的离群点检测和移除方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于极坐标的离群点检测算法（PCOD），通过极坐标变换、局部和全局标准差计算及其比较识别离群点，并结合工业检测图像的预处理流程优化圆拟合过程。

Result: 进行十种不同的圆拟合算法和五种离群点检测方法的对比后发现，PCOD算法在数据集上的准确性表现优于其它方法。

Conclusion: PCOD算法具有较高的工业应用价值，可有效提升噪声环境下圆拟合算法的准确性。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出两种方法，通过已知参考件，提高相机测量系统的精度，误差显著减少至1-2微米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管使用专业设备如远心镜头测量具有窄公差的部件，系统中仍可能因机械或软件导致测量误差，特别在测量不同直径的部件时更为明显。

Method: 提出两种方法：基于转换因子的方式与基于像素的方式，通过已知参考件计算未知部件直径，以减少测量误差。

Result: 实验在玻璃样本（1-12毫米）与金属工件（3-24毫米）上测试，测量误差从13-114微米减少到1-2微米。

Conclusion: 通过利用少量已知参考件，可实现高精度测量并显著减少误差率，为直径测量领域提供了可靠性更高的新方法。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动算法无法对非结构化IC机械图纸进行几何标注，从而阻碍了PCB设计的效率提高。

Method: 提出了LLM4-IC8K框架，通过两个阶段(在合成数据上预训练和在实际数据上微调)提升LMMs处理IC引脚几何标注任务的能力，并引入了ICGeo8K数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM4-IC8K框架在相关任务上的表现优于现有的最优多模态模型。

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K框架有效解决了IC引脚几何标注问题，为相关实际应用提供了可靠的算法支持。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Conclusion: 新方法具备高效处理TIR噪声的特点，为低能见度机器人任务中的实际部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset
are available at

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种场景中成功生成了视觉一致的主体，并且保留了扩散模型的创作能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在确保主体一致性方面表现优异，同时避免了模型再训练带来的弊端，展示了可高效生成视觉故事的潜力。

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Conclusion: 通过结合RF数据与开源地图信息，所提方法能够显著提升环境映射的精准度，为智慧城市应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC系统在语义特征的数字化传输领域展示了显著潜力，其方法创新优化了传输效率并提升了重构性能，为数字语义通信系统的应用提供了切实可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市轨道交通中准确估计站台占用率能提高安全性、操作效率和客户体验，但实时拥挤感知困难且依赖间接数据。CCTV影像作为数据来源具有潜力。

Method: 比较三种计算机视觉方法提取站台CCTV影像的拥挤特征：(a) YOLOv11、RT-DETRv2和APGCC的物体检测与计数；(b) Crowd-ViT的拥挤分类；(c) DeepLabV3的语义分割，同时提出线性优化方法从分割图中提取计数并考虑对象深度。

Conclusion: CCTV图像数据可独立于其他数据源，实现高精度实时人群估计，有助于及时做出运营响应以缓解站台拥挤。

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Refine-IQA的多阶段强化微调框架，用于增强图像质量评估（IQA）的性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化微调的IQA方法存在对“思考”过程缺乏监督，以及对低级视觉质量感知能力提升不足的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段方法，包括建立Refine-Perception-20K数据集和设计多任务奖励函数增强视觉质量感知；引入概率差奖励策略对“思考”过程进行监督。

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务上均表现出色，并激发了强大的“思考”能力，在对应质量解释基准测试上也取得了出色结果。

Conclusion: 本文的多阶段强化微调框架能够显著提升IQA性能，同时增强模型的低级视觉质量感知和质量解释能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Method: 提出了一个整合注意力增强U-Net和ResNet架构的深度学习管道4D-PreNet，用于实现去噪、中心校正及椭圆失真校准，并通过模拟数据集进行训练以提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验显示，该框架在去噪任务上将均方误差降低了50%，中心检测任务中定位误差低至0.04像素以下，在性能上较传统算法更优。

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet可实现高吞吐4D-STEM实时分析和可靠的自动化特征表征，显著提升分析效率与精度。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了生成模型的能力，还为疾病进程的形态变化预测提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种两阶段训练范式，通过使用大量噪声视频数据和少量手动精炼数据，大幅减少人工标注需求，从而实现音频同步的视觉动画扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖手动整理的高质量和特定类别训练视频，限制了技术在开放领域内扩展的可能性，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：第一阶段利用自动收集的大规模视频数据进行预训练以学习多样但不完美的音视频对齐；第二阶段在小规模手动整理的高质量数据上微调。此外，引入音频-视频多特征条件和窗口注意力机制，同时利用预训练的文本到视频生成器和音频编码器，仅增加1.9%的可训练参数。

Result: 提出了一个包含48个分类的新基准AVSync48，比现有基准更丰富，与现有方法相比，手动数据整理需求降低10倍以上，并能够推广到许多开放类别。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了对手动数据整理的依赖，实现了音频同步视觉动画在多种开放类别上的扩展，验证了方法的有效性和高效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAVID，这是首个利用视觉检索增强生成（RAG）实现AI生成图像检测的框架，其在UniversalFakeDetect基准上的平均准确率为93.85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测方法在泛化能力和鲁棒性上存在局限，且主要依赖于低层次特征和模型特定特性。同时，RAG仅在文本领域得到了较多探索，视觉领域仍属空白。

Method: RAVID通过一个经过微调的CLIP图像编码器（RAVID CLIP）动态检索相关图像，并与查询图像融合，从而构建丰富的输入，进一步利用视觉-语言模型（VLM）提高检测精度。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准上，RAVID在19种生成模型中平均准确率为93.85%，在图像降级（如高斯模糊和JPEG压缩）条件下仍保持平均80.27%的准确率，比现有最佳模型C2P-CLIP提升约17个百分点。

Conclusion: RAVID显著提升了AI生成图像检测的准确率和鲁棒性，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对基于2D图像推断食物营养成分时因图片特性带来的准确性和可重复性挑战。

Method: 对ViT模型在ImageNet与COYO两个公开数据集上进行预训练，并与其他CNN模型和JFT-300M数据集预训练方法对比，在Nutrition5k数据集上进行评估。

Result: 预训练于JFT-300M的模型显著优于公开数据集；而COYO预训练在此任务表现不如ImageNet，出乎意料。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性与质量对于2D营养预测的迁移学习至关重要，强调了数据集特性的关键作用。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的3D医学图像数据增强框架JanusNet，通过对体积块进行对齐和基于置信度的位移增强，提高弱监督医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机混合体积块的数据增广会破坏3D医学图像的解剖连续性，尤其对小器官等难以分割区域的训练效果有限。

Method: 1. Slice-Block Shuffle：对相同索引的切片块在体积间进行对齐随机打乱，以保持垂直轴面的解剖上下文。
2. Confidence-Guided Displacement：以预测置信度指导每个切片内的块替换，强调难分区域的信号。框架为可插拔设计，便于集成。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上的实验表明，仅使用20%的标注数据，JanusNet在Synapse数据集上的DSC提升了4%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部增强难分区域，JanusNet大幅提高了弱监督医学图像分割的精度，并证明了其易用性和通用性。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge系统通过引入创新的奖励与验证机制，显著提升了文本到CAD系统的生成质量和运行效率。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

*Haiqi Yang,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型多模态模型（LMMs）在处理错误输入时是否具备主动检测与检视能力，并提出ISEval框架进行评估，发现多数模型在缺乏指导下表现较差，且错误类型和模态信任影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在处理复杂任务方面表现出色，但其在面对错误输入时的主动检视能力尚不明确，亟需研究和优化。

Method: 提出ISEval框架，包括七种错误前提类别与三种评估指标，系统性测试了十种先进LMMs，分析其在不同场景下的表现。

Result: 多数LMMs在未引导情况下难以主动检测文字前提错误，对逻辑谬误表现较佳而对表面语言错误及条件性问题表现较弱。同时，模型对模态信任程度的差异也影响任务表现。

Conclusion: 研究突出了提高LMMs对输入验证能力的紧迫性并提供解决问题的新见解，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

TL;DR: 新方法PDSSNet提出以应对遥感图像语义分割挑战，核心理念为结合类别语义与空间结构信息，通过模块设计实现全面目标物获取并证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高类内差异和高类间相似的挑战，传统方法和现有类别引导方法效率不足，目标为设计能同时协调类别语义与目标结构的新网络。

Method: 设计了PDSSNet，包含三个模块：自适应原型提取模块(APEM)确保类别语义准确性；语义-结构协调模块(SSCM)通过语义优先、结构补充的层次化方式实现信息整合；通道相似性调整模块(CSAM)优化跨类别特征辨别。

Result: 实验结果表明PDSSNet性能优于目前主流方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合类别语义和空间结构特征，PDSSNet在遥感图像分割中展示出更高的精度和效率，证明了其创新设计的有效性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对图文检索中细粒度属性区分和子类别区分的挑战，通过改进CLIP模型的提示学习以提高图文匹配性能。

Method: 提出了DCAR（具有类别-属性联合重加权的双提示学习框架），从语义与视觉两个维度动态优化提示向量，结合动态更新属性描述权重和引入多视角类别匹配权重的策略，提升细粒度表征学习。

Result: 在新构建的FDRD基准数据集上，DCAR在1,500多个细分类别和23万图文对测试中实现了性能超过现有基线模型的表现。

Conclusion: DCAR框架通过优化类别和属性学习，有效解决了细粒度图文匹配挑战，为图文检索任务提供了新的解决方案，证明了其在细分类别与属性建模中的优越性。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合单目相机图像与2D雷达点云数据的框架，用于解决城市环境中因路边停车导致的视线盲区对行人检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市路边停车产生的非视距（NLoS）问题对路安全造成威胁，现有手段（如mmWave技术）在检测遮挡区域时存在局限性，尤其是对于行人从停泊车辆之间突然出现的情形。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停泊车辆，结合深度估计推断空间特性，并利用2D雷达点云数据细化空间推断。最终实现行人早期检测和定位。

Result: 实地实验表明，该方法能够更早检测行人，有助于提高道路安全性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了动态环境中现有方法的局限性，验证了其在复杂城市环境下的实用性。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

TL;DR: 本文提出了SPJFNet，一种用于暗图像恢复的高效神经网络，通过自挖掘指导模块和双频率指导框架显著提高性能并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的暗图像恢复方法效率低下，主要因依赖外部先验、多阶段复杂管道操作，以及频域方法中过多的全局计算需求。

Method: SPJFNet通过自挖掘指导模块生成轻量化的内生指导，无需外部先验；利用小波分解和傅里叶频率增强简化多级操作；并采用双频指导框架分别处理高低频信息以降低复杂度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPJFNet不仅超越最新方法的性能，还显著降低了模型复杂度和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过创新的模块设计和频率处理策略，实现了高效的暗图像恢复，可供进一步研究或实际应用。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究明确了当前视觉转化推理在时间建模和因果推理方面的不足，为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Conclusion: 新提出的DOMR框架通过结合多模态信息与目标间关系，有效提升了跨视角目标匹配的性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有插值方法未充分利用k-space中的全局依赖性，而Transformer因其捕捉长距离依赖的能力被引入以优化此问题。

Method: 提出基于全局可预测插值的白盒Transformer框架GPI-WT，将k-space结构的低秩模型中全局消除滤波器作为可学习参数，并通过展开其优化算法构建级联网络。

Result: 实验结果证明该方法在插值精度和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI-WT框架在提高k-space插值性能和模型可靠性方面具有重要意义，为加速MRI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅实现多任务间协同而非干扰，同时大幅提升了扩展性，还能够在无需大量特定任务设计的情况下适配多种文档修复任务。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

### [41] [TCSAFormer: Efficient Vision Transformer with Token Compression and Sparse Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04058)
*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高效医学图像分割网络TCSAFormer，通过压缩注意力模块和双分支前馈网络模块，解决了传统Transformer在医学图像分割中计算复杂度高和多尺度特征捕捉能力弱的问题，在多个公开数据集上表现优异，同时计算开销较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer应用于医学图像分割时，虽能捕捉长距离依赖，但存在计算复杂度高和对局部上下文与多尺度信息捕捉能力不足的问题。

Method: 引入压缩注意力模块（CA）结合令牌压缩和像素级稀疏注意力，以及替换标准FFN为双分支前馈网络模块（DBFFN），分别优化计算效率并增强特征表示能力。

Result: 在ISIC-2018、CVC-ClinicDB和Synapse等三个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，TCSAFormer性能优于现有方法，且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer实现了在效率和准确性之间的最佳平衡，证明了其在医学图像分割任务中的优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhaochen Liu,Kaiwen Gao,Shuyi Liang,Bin Xiao,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma,Tingting Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的视觉问题解答（VQA）基准O-Bench，用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的遮挡感知能力，并揭示了它们的主要缺陷与改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型在视觉与语言结合任务中表现出色，但在复杂的遮挡感知任务中的能力尚未被深入探索。

Method: 研究者创建了O-Bench基准，包括使用分层合成方法生成的1,365张图片和4,588个问答对，覆盖五种遮挡感知任务，并利用半自动化的流程标注数据。

Result: 对22个代表性MLLMs的大范围评估表明，其遮挡感知能力远低于人类表现，并发现了其三个典型问题：过于保守的偏差、脆弱的整体预测能力以及在量化任务中的不足。

Conclusion: O-Bench为研究遮挡感知提供了关键的评估工具，并有望推动更具视觉智能的多模态大型语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TNet的解码网络，专注于跨分辨率全局上下文融合，通过多数据集取得优秀分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割网络不足以捕捉跨分辨率的全局上下文依赖，提出解决方案。

Method: 设计了仅利用卷积和加法操作的TNet，通过逐步融合低分辨率的全局特征和高分辨率的局部特征，学习空间感知卷积内核。

Result: TNet使用ResNet-18编码器，在三个基准数据集上取得了有竞争力的mIoU（85.35%、87.05%、52.19%），同时保持了高计算效率。

Conclusion: TNet通过简单但有效的架构，显著平衡了性能与计算效率，是一种适合遥感分割任务的架构。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为3DSR的3D超分辨率方法，利用基于扩散的2D超分辨模型，并通过3D高斯点结合实现跨视图3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有方法中缺乏3D一致性的问题，提高3D重建的视觉质量和空间一致性。

Method: 引入基于3D高斯点结合的场景表示，并结合2D扩散超分辨模型，实现无需额外微调的高分辨率视觉效果。

Result: 在数据集MipNeRF360和LLFF上评估，结果表明能生成高质量的高分辨率图像，同时保持3D结构一致性。

Conclusion: 3DSR方法能在无需额外调整的情况下显著提升视觉质量，为3D超分辨率研究提供了新的方法，并计划开源代码。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯散射中稀疏视角条件下的几何重建挑战，克服现有方法难以捕捉细粒度结构和忽略语义边界的问题。

Method: 提出了基于层次几何深度监督与语义边界引导的正则化方法，结合Canny边缘检测及总变差损失进行深度与结构优化。

Result: 实验表明，DET-GS在几何精度与视觉保真度方面显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS方法通过强化几何一致性与边界细节恢复，在稀疏视角的场景合成任务中表现出色，为改进3D重建质量提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NEARL-CLIP的框架，旨在通过新的跨模态交互机制提升视觉语言模型（VLM）在医学影像分析中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以直接应用于医疗影像分析，主要受到领域间差距的限制。旨在解决该问题，同时避免现有方法引起的模态失配问题。

Method: 提出了NEARL-CLIP框架，包括：(1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer)，生成跨模态查询以促进模态间交互；(2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA)，通过正交分解隔离新知识与增量知识，从而优化学习过程。

Result: 该方法实现了高效的参数利用，仅引入了1.46M可学习参数，验证了其对提升多模态医疗领域知识的交互与增强能力。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP通过高效参数设计和创新性模态交互机制，在提升医学影像分析能力方面展现了潜力，并有效发挥了VLM的性能。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MLLMSeg的新框架，优化了参照表达分割任务中的性能与计算成本平衡，并公开了代码以供使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在性能与成本之间权衡的问题。

Method: 提出利用MLLM视觉编码器的详细视觉特征，并设计了一个细节增强与语义一致的特征融合模块（DSFF）及轻量化的掩模解码器，从而避免引入额外的视觉编码器。

Result: 所提出的方法在广泛实验中胜过基于SAM和非基于SAM的竞品，在性能与成本之间取得了更优平衡。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过结合视觉与语义特征，实现了参照表达分割任务的高效精准性能，同时保持较低的计算成本。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is
available at https://github.com/jcwang0602/MLLMSeg.

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle框架提供了一种有效的车辆搜索方式，克服了检测和识别任务的目标冲突问题，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: 单尺度方法同样具备卓越性能，SSD-Net通过独特设计实现高效信息解耦与融合，为水下图像增强提供了一种更简约的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final

Method: 提出了DS$^2$Net，通过细节增强模块(DEM)和语义增强模块(SEM)实现多视角深度监督，并引入基于不确定性的监督损失，自适应调整特征监督强度。

Result: 在六个医学图像基准数据集上，DS$^2$Net模型均优于现有的先进方法。

Conclusion: DS$^2$Net基于多视角深度监督策略有效提升医学图像分割性能，体现了细节与语义特征监督结合的优势。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

### [55] [UniFGVC: Universal Training-Free Few-Shot Fine-Grained Vision Classification via Attribute-Aware Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04136)
*Hongyu Guo,Kuan Zhu,Xiangzhao Hao,Haiyun Guo,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出UniFGVC，一个无监督训练的通用框架，通过将小样本细粒度视觉分类转化为多模态检索任务，利用多模态大语言模型提取细粒度特征并生成图像描述，同时采用多模态模板检索实现分类。实验验证了该框架在多个基准数据集上的性能优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前预训练视觉语言模型容易出现过拟合和弱泛化的问题，提升小样本细粒度视觉分类（FGVC）的效果。

Method: 提出UniFGVC框架，包含两个主要步骤：1）设计Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner（CDV-Captioner），通过链式思维提示和视觉相似参考图生成区分性强的图像文本描述；2）使用现成的视觉和文本编码器，将生成的多模态模板和查询图像嵌入到联合空间中，通过检索最近的模板完成分类。

Result: 在12个FGVC基准数据集上，UniFGVC实现了比现有基于CLIP的小样本方法以及部分完全监督的多模态模型更优的性能表现。

Conclusion: UniFGVC可以在无需训练的情况下，实现对不同多模态模型的广泛兼容性和小样本细粒度视觉分类场景中的稳定泛化性和适应性。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IDC-Net，一种用于生成RGB-D视频序列的几何感知扩散模型，以实现精确的摄像机轨迹控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB与深度生成分离导致的几何一致性问题，增强生成视频序列中的几何和空间一致性。

Method: 构建一个摄像机-图像-深度一致的数据集，并引入几何感知Transformer模块，用以支持统一训练和精确的摄像机控制。

Result: IDC-Net在视觉质量和几何一致性方面优于现有方法，生成的RGB-D序列可直接用于后续3D场景重建任务。

Conclusion: IDC-Net凭借联合学习框架和几何感知设计，实现了视频序列生成的高质量与高一致性，实用性强。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ICM-Fusion框架，用于优化LoRA模型多任务适应性，解决当前多任务融合方法中的参数冲突和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有LoRA预训练模型在多任务适应中的泛化能力，同时解决参数冲突和遗忘问题。

Method: 通过结合元学习与上下文适应，提出了任务向量算术和自设计的Fusion VAE（F-VAE），在隐空间中优化任务向量方向，从而重建融合LoRA。

Result: ICM-Fusion能够适配于多种架构模型及任务，在减少多任务损失和少样本场景增强任务表现方面表现优越。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion解决了多任务融合中的关键问题，有效提升LoRA模型的多任务扩展能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用音频辅助人脸视频恢复网络 (GAVN)，用于处理流媒体视频中的各种失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人脸视频恢复方法多数忽略了视觉和音频特征之间的内在相关性，尤其是嘴部区域，而已有的音频辅助方法仅关注压缩伪影的去除。

Method: GAVN通过身份和时间互补学习，采用低分辨率空间的帧间时间特征捕捉和高分辨率空间的帧内特征恢复（结合音频信号和面部关键点），最后整合两类特征以生成高质量人脸视频。

Result: 实验结果表明，GAVN在去除压缩伪影、去模糊和超分辨率任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN在多种视频失真恢复任务中的性能表现优异，展现出其广泛应用潜力，相关代码将在发表后公开。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对表情包传播有害内容的问题，以及由于数据获取和数据集构建成本过高限制了表情包 moderation 系统的发展。

Method: 构建了首个包含 6,300 条真实世界表情包的帖子数据集，并通过分类和标签生成两个阶段对其进行标注，同时引入了辅助元数据的社交相关标签模块。

Result: 实验表明，生成的标签显著提高了最新视觉语言模型在毒性检测任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 这一研究为改进多模态在线环境中的内容 moderation 提供了具创新性且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种框架，通过改进多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的域适应能力，解决其在特定异常检测应用中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）的方法在异常检测中存在训练数据利用不足和推理过程监督欠缺的问题。

Method: 引入了多阶段推理过程和细粒度奖励机制，提供从区域识别到聚焦分析的指导，并整合分类准确性与定位监督。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上的综合评估显示，方法显著改善了模型的性能，在检测微细制造缺陷和结构异常方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效适配了现有标注，高效提升了从通用多模态语言模型到专用异常检测的能力迁移效率。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了U2CLLIE框架，通过不确定性感知的增强和空间-颜色因果关联建模，提升低光照图像增强效果，解决极暗条件下噪声和梯度退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多低光照图像增强方法主要集中在架构创新，却忽略了极暗条件下特征表示的不确定性和因果推理能力受损。

Method: 提出U2CLLIE框架，包括：(1)不确定性感知的双域降噪模块，通过高斯引导的自适应频域特征增强(G2AF)抑制噪声；(2)分层因果建模框架，亮度增强网络(LEN)初步增强亮度，之后通过NeCo和AsC模块进行空间与颜色因果关联建模。

Result: 实验表明，U2CLLIE在多个基准数据集上表现超越现有方法，具有出色的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: U2CLLIE有效提升了低光照图像在极端条件下的增强质量，展示出对梯度消失和噪声的强大抑制能力。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Motivation: 探索ViT-22B模型的实际效用，特别是在局部环境中的性能表现及其对图像生成任务的潜力。

Method: 研究ViT-22B的训练表现，解决其训练不稳定性，并通过模型调整加以改进；并提出一种基于ViT的图像生成架构，对比分析ViT和ViT-22B在图像生成任务中的适用性。

Result: ViT-22B从头训练后，在同等参数规模下整体性能优于ViT；初步显示其在图像生成任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: 相比ViT，ViT-22B在性能和应用扩展性方面展示出明显优势，尤其是在图像生成任务的结构适配上具有潜力。

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RPCA模型计算成本高、需要精调超参数且在动态场景中适应能力差，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出RPCANet++框架，将放松的RPCA模型展开为包含背景估计模块、物体提取模块和图像修复模块的结构化网络，并通过引入增强模块和深度对比先验模块提升性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上，RPCANet++在不同的成像场景中实现了最先进的性能，同时在低秩性和稀疏性测量方面提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合RPCA理论的优势与深度网络的高效性，RPCANet++设立了可靠且可解释的稀疏对象分割新基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are
available at our Project Webpage https://fengyiwu98.github.io/rpcanetx.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对生物医学领域多模态大语言模型的“机器遗忘”基准（MLLMU-Med），用于评估隐私保护和错误知识移除的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学多模态大语言模型中，训练数据可能包含难以检测的隐私信息和错误知识，会导致部署后隐私泄露或输出错误结果。重新训练模型成本过高，因此亟需一种解决方案来选择性移除有害样本派生的知识。

Method: 开发了一套数据生成管线，构造了含有合成隐私数据和事实错误的数据集MLLMU-Med，用于测试模型遗忘性能。同时提出了一种新颖的“遗忘效率评分”指标，并评估了五种遗忘方法在此基准上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有的五种遗忘方法在移除生物医学多模态大语言模型中的有害知识方面效果有限，有明显改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究为生物医学领域多模态大语言模型的安全性研究开辟了新方向，并强调了进一步优化遗忘方法的必要性。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

TL;DR: 作者提出了一个新的Video TextVQA模型GAT（Gather and Trace），通过实例聚合和轨迹追踪模块改进精度和效率，并超过现有方法与视频大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video TextVQA方法基于帧级框架，但存在冗余文本实体和隐式关系建模的问题，限制了模型的精度和效率。

Method: 提出GAT模型，包含两个模块：1）实例聚合模块结合视觉外观、布局特性和文本内容，为每个视频文本实例生成统一的文本表示；2）轨迹追踪模块捕捉文本的时空动态演变，推理最终答案。

Result: GAT模型在多个Video TextVQA公开数据集上进行了实验，表现出高精度和强泛化性。模型在准确率上超过现有方法3.86%，推理速度比视频大语言模型快十倍。

Conclusion: GAT从实例的角度重新定义了Video TextVQA任务，在精度和速度上都实现了显著提升，为该领域提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Motivation: 传统谱聚类方法在亲和矩阵构建、谱嵌入和聚类阶段是分开优化的，影响了效率和性能。此外，表征能力有限也限制了聚类效果。

Method: 提出BootSC模型，通过单一网络端到端学习谱聚类的全部阶段，并利用基于最优传输的监督机制增强亲和矩阵和聚类分配矩阵。引入语义一致的正交重参数化技术优化谱嵌入的正交性，提高鉴别能力。

Result: 实验证明BootSC đạt到了最先进的聚类性能。比如在具有挑战性的ImageNet-Dogs数据集上，比次优方法显著提高了16%的NMI。

Conclusion: BootSC使用端到端的优化策略和创新技术，显著克服了传统谱聚类方法的缺陷，在聚类性能方面达到了新的高度，适用于复杂数据集。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Conclusion: ViFP能显著提升视觉语言模型推理的准确性和可靠性，为解决视觉推理中的假阳性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Motivation: 医学疾病诊断，尤其是小病灶的误诊问题，需要更准确的工具来应对。

Result: 在Lung-PET-CT-Dx数据集上的评估表明，该模型在诊断准确率上显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net成功提升了多模态医学数据诊断的效果，为领域发展提供了新方法。

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的新方法对研究开放词汇分割的局限性提供了深入见解，并可能推动该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出 SplitGaussian 框架，通过对静态和动态场景进行明确分解，解决了单目视频中动态 3D 场景重建的稳定性差和解释性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法将静态和动态元素混合建模，导致运动泄漏、几何扭曲及时间抖动。

Method: 引入 SplitGaussian 框架，将场景表示分解为静态和动态成分，静态部分保持不变，动态部分支持时间和视图相关的外观细化。

Result: SplitGaussian 在渲染质量、几何稳定性和动态分离方面超过现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 框架的分离式设计提升了时间一致性和重建保真度，并加速了收敛过程。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Motivation: 现有T2V方法在多物体运动场景中表现不足，尤其在物体轨迹交叉时存在语义冲突问题。

Method: 提出LayerT2V，通过分层生成背景与前景对象，每个元素位于独立的“层”上。

Result: 实验表明，LayerT2V在mIoU和AP50指标上比SOTA方法分别提升1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V在多物体场景生成中表现优越，拓宽了T2V生成的控制能力并解决了语义冲突问题。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Conclusion: DocVCE首次在文档图像分析领域引入反事实解释，为理解模型决策提供了新视角，显著提升了模型的透明性和可解释性。

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Result: 冻结嵌入在分辨任务中保留了丰富信息，可达现有技术85%-95%的表现。FrEVL提供了2.3倍加速，能耗降低52%。

Conclusion: 冻结嵌入的有效性取决于预训练目标和下游任务需求的匹配，在特定条件下是替代完整模型部署的可行方案。

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and
classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to

reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Result: PIS3R在大视差场景下提供了准确的拼接结果，并在定性和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PIS3R具备大视差耐受性，可保留像素几何完整性，且可用于后续3D视觉任务如结构自运动。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 通过简单高效的去学习方法，能够有效缓解LVLMs中的训练偏差和幻觉问题，同时保证方法扩展性和泛化能力，为提升多模态模型质量提供了解决方案。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: PKSS-Align在多种影响条件下实现了鲁棒且高效的点云配准，不需要训练数据，具有较高的实际应用可行性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized
feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse
baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large
baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于时间句子定位的长短度感知Transformer (LATR)，通过引入特定的查询分工改善定位准确性，并在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DETR的模型虽然在时间句子定位任务上取得了进展，但由于缺乏明确的监督，查询任务会重叠，导致冗余预测。作者希望通过设计专门任务的查询减少这一问题。

Method: 该方法引入了LATR模型，将查询分为三组，分别负责预测短、中、长时间段的片段，并在训练中加入长度分类任务以抑制长度不匹配的预测，从而引导查询专注于其指定角色。

Result: 该方法在三个公开基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时通过消融实验验证了每个组件的贡献以及长度先验在任务中的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过利用视频描述对的长度先验，LATR模型有效改善了时间句子定位任务的性能，为进一步研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于Mask Autoencoder的DAS信号识别基础模型MAEPD，通过拆解重构任务和视觉提示调优，实现了高效的跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式声学传感技术（DAS）应用的增长，异构环境中的数据分布差异限制了AI模型的跨域泛化能力，并缺乏标注数据。

Method: 提出MAEPD基础模型，以自监督掩码重构任务预训练深度语义表征。使用视觉提示调优（VPT）方法，通过仅微调Transformer编码器层的小部分向量，完成下游任务。

Result: 在室内步态识别任务中，VPT-Deep方法仅微调0.322%参数，实现96.94%分类准确率，比传统方法提升0.61%，训练时间减少45%。同时在管道泄漏检测等任务中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MAEPD模型展现卓越的泛化能力、高效性及可扩展性，为DAS领域信号识别模型开辟了新的范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Result: 实现了人类偏好对齐和标准文本到图像生成任务中的最新最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过更加合理的奖励分配以及时间感知的优化方法，TempFlow-GRPO有效改善了文本到图像生成中的探索效率和模型收敛质量。

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为RiemanLine的Riemannian流形上的最小表示方法，用于统一处理3D线条和平行线组，同时提高相机定位和结构映射的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人学和计算机视觉中的3D线条表示方法主要处理独立线条，未充分利用如平行线等结构规则性。此外，现有方法在参数空间优化和线条重建方面效率不足。

Method: 通过将每个线条分解为全局方向和局部分量，分别优化：全局方向在球面上处理，局部分量在正交子空间优化，从而使结构规则性紧凑地编码。并将该表示集成到因子图框架中，用流形的捆绑调整进行全局对齐和局部投影优化。

Result: 在ICL-NUIM、TartanAir和合成基准上的实验表明，该方法在显著提高姿态估计和线条重建精度的同时，降低了参数复杂度并改善了收敛稳定性。

Conclusion: RiemanLine表示方法显著优化3D线条表示和优化问题，通过减少参数维数和嵌入结构约束提高性能，展示出在复杂3D环境中更好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在自然光条件下实现了高精度的形状和反射率恢复，为后续逆向渲染任务提供了强有力支持。

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Conclusion: ProtoN框架有效改善了少样本条件下的耳部识别能力，为基于耳部生物特征的身份识别提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Transformer的多头注意力机制在多任务学习中计算成本过高，限制了硬件性能，因此需要解决方法来更高效地处理多任务特征聚合。

Conclusion: 新方法在计算效率和任务预测性能方面均表现突出，为多任务学习领域提供了有力支持。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的任务Composed Object Retrieval (COR)，用于基于组合表达式实现目标对象的检索和分割，并开发了第一个大规模基准COR127K及统一的模型CORE，在多模态细粒度检索研究中取得显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的组合图像检索（CIR）方法只能进行图像级别的匹配，无法定位具体对象。为了解决这一问题，提出了目标输入和检索文本组合用于更精细检索和定位的任务。

Method: 提出了一个全新的任务COR及大规模基准数据集COR127K，包含多种语义变换，并提出模型CORE，以统一编码、视觉文本交互、区域级别对比学习等方法提升任务表现。

Result: 实验表明，CORE模型在基础和新类别上明显优于现有方法，为该领域建立了一个有效基线。

Conclusion: 本文开创了细粒度多模态检索的新方向，为实现高精度目标检索迈出了重要的一步。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

*Jonas Ammeling,Jonathan Ganz,Emely Rosbach,Ludwig Lausser,Christof A. Bertram,Katharina Breininger,Marc Aubreville*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于自监督学习的基础模型在病理图像中有丝分裂分类任务中的表现，展示了数据扩展和LoRA技术的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像特定任务中标签数据有限，而基础模型可以通过自监督学习使用大量无标签数据生成能更好泛化的新任务的特征表示，从而提升模型性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 研究了多种基础模型下的数据扩展规律，对比了线性微调和LoRA技术在少量训练数据的适应效果，同时与端到端训练的CNN和视觉Transformer作对比。

Result: LoRA技术的基础模型在仅使用10%训练数据时接近全数据时的性能，并在跨域评估中接近消除性能差距；传统架构的全微调仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: LoRA技术显著提高了基础模型在有限数据下和跨域任务中的适应能力，同时传统架构的性能仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

*Qingguo Hu,Ante Wang,Jia Song,Delai Qiu,Qingsong Liu,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过新颖的因果关系驱动的视觉对象完成任务（CVC）框架来提升大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）视觉认知能力的方法，展现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于广泛使用的指令微调语料中视觉知识的稀缺，LVLM在需要深层视觉感知的任务中表现较差。本文旨在弥补这一缺陷，提升模型的视觉感知和推理能力。

Method: 提出CVC任务，通过自动实例构造管道生成丰富的实例数据，再利用这些数据进行试错式自我改进。无需依赖高端LVLM（如GPT-4V）或人工辅助。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的特殊任务和四个综合基准测试上，取得了显著改善。LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-1.5-13B分别平均提升5.4%和4.0%。

Conclusion: CVC任务显著提高了LVLM的视觉推理能力，为未来视觉-语言建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

TL;DR: 4DVD是一种分级视频扩散模型，通过分解任务，实现高效的4D数据生成，并在单眼视频输入的基础上达到高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决直接生成高维4D数据复杂性高的问题，通过分解任务简化生成过程，并提升生成质量和稳定性。

Method: 通过分解为粗略多视角布局生成和结构感知条件生成两个子任务。使用D-Objaverse数据集进行模型训练，同时结合输入视频的外观信息与结构先验生成高质量输出。

Result: 在新视角合成和4D生成领域表现达到了当前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 4DVD的创新性解决了4D内容生成中的效率与质量问题，其表现验证了模型的有效性，同时提供了广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ErasePro方法，通过逐层更新和严格对齐优化，实现更完整的概念清除与更优的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念清除方法在复杂文本提示下易于产生不完全清除，同时深层参数更新集中可能导致生成质量下降。

Method: 引入严格的零残差约束以优化对齐，并采用逐层参数更新策略，从浅层到深层逐步转移目标概念特征。

Result: ErasePro在不同概念清除任务中（如对象、艺术风格、裸体等清除）体现出出色性能。

Conclusion: ErasePro通过更完整的概念清除和生成质量保持，解决了现有方法的不足，在实际任务中展现了其有效性。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种量化模型（QuantVSR），通过利用低比特量化方法在不显著损失精度的情况下实现对视频超分辨模型的压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视频超分辨任务中的优异表现受制于其高资源和时间消耗；为解决这一问题，研究者希望通过量化解决模型压缩问题，但面临时序特性和高保真度要求的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种时空复杂性感知机制（STCA），通过校准数据集测量模型层的时空复杂性，并基于统计分配分层排名。此外，加入可学习的偏置对齐模块（LBA）以减少量化误差，并同时优化低比特和全精度分支。

Result: 实验表明，QuantVSR的性能与全精度模型相当，并且显著优于目前先进的低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: QuantVSR是一种高效的低比特量化模型，能在不牺牲性能的情况下极大地改善视频超分辨模型的部署效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种关注干预表示以提高模型分布外鲁棒性的因果表示学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有因果表示学习研究对干预表示关注不足的问题，从而提高模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过提出“因果差嵌入”方法，表示干预可在视觉场景中保持不变，同时在因果变量中稀疏作用，并设计一个框架以无需额外监督从图像对中学习因果表示。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的因果差嵌入在分布外（OOD）场景中表现出色，在合成和真实世界的基准测试中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 聚焦于干预表示的因果表示学习方法可显著提高模型在分布外场景中的性能，因此是值得进一步探索的方向。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法存在透明性不足和依赖繁琐标注的限制，该研究旨在通过透明和高效的方式改进检测性能。

Method: 引入RAIDX框架，采用RAG结合外部知识提升检测精度，并通过GRPO实现生成细粒度文本解释和显著性图，实现自动化。

Conclusion: RAIDX框架首次将RAG和GRPO结合，填补了深度伪造检测领域在准确性和可解释性上的关键空白，并计划开源代码和模型，以促进后续研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Motivation: 目前知识蒸馏主要集中于特征层面的知识转移，教师模型的logit分布中的关键信息常被忽视。作者认为利用logit分布中的Top-K信息可以改善知识蒸馏效果。

Method: 提出了Top-scaled Knowledge Distillation (TopKD)框架，包括两个模块：(1) Top-K Scaling Module (TSM)，自适应放大最具信息量的logit；(2) Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL)，提供针对性的有效监督。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet、STL-10和Tiny-ImageNet上的实验结果表明，TopKD能够显著超越现有最优的知识蒸馏方法，尤其是在蒸馏Vision Transformers时表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 通过充分挖掘logit中的Top-K知识，TopKD框架展示了基于logit的知识蒸馏在提高模型性能上的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 探索一种有效方法以通过步态信号评估帕金森病（PD）严重程度，并克服数据严重不平衡问题。

Method: 设计了InceptoFormer框架，包括1D版的Inception（Inception1D）捕获多尺度时间特征，Transformer负责建模步态序列中的长依赖关系，引入数据平衡策略增强分类表现。

Conclusion: InceptoFormer通过结合多尺度时间信息与全局动态分析，有效提升帕金森病严重程度评估的准确性，其结果对实际诊断具有重要意义。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

### [109] [Hierarchical Event Memory for Accurate and Low-latency Online Video Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04546)

Conclusion: 新的OnVTG方法有效解决了传统模型的挑战，通过引入事件级建模和长短时记忆机制，大幅提升了在线视频时间定位任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究多专注于虚拟试穿和虚拟试脱的单一任务，忽视其相辅相成的特性，为弥补这一研究空白提出该模型。

Method: 开发了一个双向服装传递模型（TWGTM），通过引用图像的潜在空间和像素空间进行双向条件引导，并设计分阶段的训练范式以解决模态差异问题。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上完成了广泛的定性和定量实验，验证了这种方法的有效性及其竞争优势。

Conclusion: TWGTM模型在虚拟试穿与虚拟试脱任务上具备创新性，提供了统一并高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Conclusion: 通过提出基于跨模态显著锚点的方法，有效提升了弱监督条件下事件时间定位的性能。

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: OMFA框架克服了传统方法的主要不足，无需展品服装和分割掩码，支持灵活姿势和多视图，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Result: 通过大量消融和对比实验验证了所提方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: TAlignDiff框架在自动牙齿对齐中展示了巨大潜力，有望在正畸治疗中广泛应用。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Conclusion: DDTracking提供了一种解剖学合理且鲁棒的纤维束追踪方法，具备良好的扩展性和适应性，可广泛应用于dMRI分析。

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad
dMRI applications. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了名为K2Sight的框架，通过引入结构化语义监督解决医疗图像中基于文本描述定位异常的问题，使用少量数据实现了小规模模型的高效训练及优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理自然领域任务时表现良好，但因医疗领域的专业性和特殊性，通用模型难以有效对齐文本和视觉模式。采用大规模预训练的专业化医疗模型尽管性能更强，却需要大量标注和计算资源。

Method: 提出K2Sight框架，通过分解临床概念为可解释的视觉属性（如形状、密度、解剖位置），利用领域本体提取这些属性并用指令式提示编码，指导模型在训练期间实现区域与文本对齐，从而以数据高效的方式训练紧凑的模型。

Conclusion: K2Sight框架通过明确的领域知识与空间结构桥接，提升了模型训练效率和性能，为医疗影像分析提供了数据高效且成本较低的替代方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

Conclusion: 有效的图像预处理和模型选择对构建坚实且可解释的皮肤病分类系统至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

Conclusion: X-SAM框架扩展了分割能力，并通过创新的任务和训练策略，推动了多模态像素级视觉理解的进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

### [123] [HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04663)
*Young D. Kwon,Rui Li,Sijia Li,Da Li,Sourav Bhattacharya,Stylianos I. Venieris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HierarchicalPrune，一个可以压缩大规模文本到图像扩散模型的框架，同时保持模型输出质量，降低内存和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的文本到图像扩散模型效果显著，但其巨大的参数规模使低资源设备上的推理变得困难，亟需压缩方法。

Method: 通过结合层次位置剪枝、位置权重保留和敏感性引导蒸馏三种技术，降低模型所需内存和推理延迟，同时保持性能。

Result: 在结合INT4量化后，将内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟减少27.9-38.0%，性能与原始模型相比损失最小，仅为2.6%-7%。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune能够有效压缩扩散模型以适应低资源设备推理，同时保留高质量输出，用户研究也证明了其性能优越。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

*Tongfan Guan,Jiaxin Guo,Chen Wang,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniDepth，一个系统结合单目和立体视觉方法的深度估计框架，通过动态双向对齐提高深度估计精度，特别是在反光和透明表面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目方法具有上下文先验优势但精度不足，立体视觉利用几何精度但在复杂表面存在模糊问题，两者亟需整合。

Method: 通过一种新的跨注意力对齐机制，将单目上下文信息与立体假设表示进行双向动态同步，对深度估计进行联合优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，在Middlebury和ETH3D测试集上，OmniDepth的零次实验误差减少了超过40%，并有效解决了透明和反光表面问题。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过结合单目和立体视觉优势，实现了比单一方法更鲁棒的三维感知，突破了单一模式的局限性，并提供了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

*Kagan Ozturk,Deeksha Arun,Kevin W. Bowyer,Patrick Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了双耳对称性对CNN耳部识别的影响，并表明区分左右耳的训练和测试方法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳部识别是一种可靠的生物识别技术。现有研究较少关注双耳对称性对CNN特征学习的影响，从而提出该研究。

Method: 开发了一个耳朵分类器，用于区分耳朵左右，并在训练和测试时引入此信息。通过对五个数据集的交叉验证来评估方法有效性，并进行了相关消融实验。

Result: 研究结果表明，训练和测试时单独处理左右耳可显著提升识别准确性。消融实验提供了有关大规模数据集训练的实际建议。

Conclusion: 区分左右耳处理是提升CNN耳识别系统性能的关键因素，模型设计需充分利用双耳对称性特点。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为FinMMR的新双语多模态基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在金融数值推理任务中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准在金融多模态数值推理方面的综合性和挑战性不足，因此设计了一个更全面、更具挑战性的基准。

Method: 对现有金融推理基准进行改造，并从最新的中文金融研究报告中构造新问题，形成一个包含14种类别和多个金融子领域的基准数据集，囊括表格、柱状图和股权结构图等图片数据。

Result: 提出的基准覆盖14个金融子领域，模型在难题上的最高准确率仅为53%，表明该任务对现有模型的巨大挑战。

Conclusion: FinMMR能够推动多模态大语言模型在真实场景中推理能力的提升。

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

*Kushin Mukherjee,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个新的基准EncQA，用于评估多模态视觉-语言模型在图表理解中的视觉编码与分析任务能力。通过2,076个人工生成的QA对，作者发现当前模型在特定任务和编码上的性能存在显著差异，且模型规模增加不会提升所有任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现当前多模态视觉-语言模型在图表理解任务中虽然表现有进步，但未能全面覆盖所需的视觉推理能力，因此需要一个全面的评估基准来揭示模型在图表理解中的能力差距。

Method: 提出了EncQA基准，包括2,076个人工生成的问题-答案对，覆盖六种视觉编码（位置、长度、面积、定量颜色、定性颜色、形状）和八种任务（如找出极值、检索值、发现异常等）；并评估了9个最先进的视觉-语言模型。

Result: 模型在不同编码和任务上的表现差异显著，且在许多任务-编码组合中，增加模型大小并未带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解能力需要有针对性的策略来弥补特定视觉推理能力的不足，而不是单纯扩大模型或数据集的规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出PixCuboid，一种基于深度特征对齐的优化方法，用于房间布局估计，并显著超过当前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法主要基于单视角且假设全景图像的局限性，改进房间布局估算的精度和扩展能力。

Method: 提出基于深度特征多视图对齐的优化算法PixCuboid，通过端到端训练获得特征图，配合简单启启发式方法初始化房间布局。

Result: 在基于ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics的新基准评估中，方法在单个房间布局上显著优于现有方法，并支持扩展至多房间布局。

Conclusion: PixCuboid在准确的房间布局估算中表现出显著的性能优势，展示了面向多房间布局的灵活性，为未来扩展性提供了可能性。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt是一种新的提示调优框架，旨在通过抗噪提示增强视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，并在多个基准测试中表现出优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示调优方法在遇到弱语义干扰时容易失效，导致模型对未见类别的泛化能力下降。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合原始和干扰的文本嵌入生成抗噪提示，并使用多种目标函数（对齐损失、鲁棒性损失等）加强模型的抗噪能力，同时在视觉编码器中计算抗噪视觉提示原型来捕捉噪声感知的视觉语义。

Result: 在11个基准上的实验表明，ANPrompt在抗语义噪声和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过创新的框架设计显著提升了视觉语言模型在噪声条件下的鲁棒性和对新类别的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Motivation: 现有数据集多关注特定的交互类别，缺乏对AI助理从第一人称视角感知和操作的研究。研究者希望填补这一空白，推动通用智能助理的发展。

Method: 嵌入人工辅助任务到一个视觉-语言-动作框架中，使用混合RGB-MoCap系统收集数据，并基于GPT生成脚本让虚拟助手与场景进行互动。

Result: 开发出一个名为InterVLA的大规模多模态数据集，包含11.4小时、1.2M帧的多模态数据，包括2个第一人称视角和5个外部视角视频。

Conclusion: InterVLA数据集和相关基准测试可用于推进基于实体环境开发AI智能体的研究。

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Conclusion: TurboTrain能有效捕捉时空多代理特征，预训练和多任务策略显著提升检测与预测性能，减少了复杂训练管线设计的需求。

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的鸟瞰图感知代表环境的俯视图，对于3D目标检测、分割和轨迹预测至关重要，但现有研究未充分挖掘BEV模型中的表示学习潜力。

Method: BEVCon引入两个对比学习模块：用于优化BEV特征的实例特征对比模块和用于增强图像主干网络的视角对比模块，通过基于检测损失的稠密对比学习改进特征表示。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，BEVCon在当前最先进方法的基础上实现了性能提升，最高提高达+2.4%的mAP。

Conclusion: BEVCon表明表示学习在BEV感知中具有关键作用，为传统任务优化提供了有力的补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

Motivation: 现有3D占据表示在处理多帧输入时面临高计算成本和时空不一致的问题。

Method: 提出ST-Occ框架，包括空间时间记忆模块和动态感知的记忆注意机制，以提升时间一致性和捕捉历史信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在提升3mIoU的同时，还将时间不一致性降低了29%。

Conclusion: ST-Occ成功通过有效的时空表示学习，解决了3D占据建模中时空聚合效率和一致性的问题。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

TL;DR: 论文研究了GPT-4 Turbo在身份维度上的代表性偏差，发现其产生的叙述过度代表了文化上的主导群体，即使通过提示试图鼓励多样性效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在代表性偏差上的表现，特别是对种姓和宗教这些较少被关注的身份维度的探讨，以及评估现有方法纠正偏差的有限性。

Method: 研究通过提示GPT-4 Turbo生成约7200个关于印度重要生活事件的故事，并与印度人口普查数据中的种姓和宗教分布进行比较，评估偏差程度和变化。

Result: 发现GPT-4 Turbo的生成文本过度代表了主流文化群体，无论提示如何调整，偏差依然明显，并且针对性的提示效果有限且不一致。

Conclusion: 仅通过多样化的训练数据无法有效矫正LLM中的偏差，提示更加根本性的模型开发变革需求。

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing

Motivation: 印度农民在农村地区因识字率低且缺乏及时、语言友好的农业建议。

Method: 提出了一种基于IFT模型的农业聊天助手，通过三组印度农业数据集微调模型，采用多轮对话流、检索增强生成（RAG）技术结合语音输入输出提升可访问性。

Result: 系统实现了97.53%的准确率，91.35%的语境相关性及个性化，查询完成率为97.53%，平均响应时间小于6秒。

Conclusion: 结合意图驱动对话流、指令微调模型和检索生成技术，可以显著提高数字农业支持的质量和可访问性。

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为分层验证树（HVT）的新框架，通过优化推理过程显著提高了大语言模型（LLMs）的算力效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因大语言模型（LLMs）在推理过程中存在的低效问题，尤其是在序列生成中多余的计算开销。

Method: 引入分层验证树（HVT）框架，通过优先验证高概率草稿并早期修剪不理想的候选项来提高推理效率，同时不需要重新训练或修改模型架构。

Result: 实验表明，HVT在多个数据集和模型上都优于现有的推理方法，大幅度减少了推理时间与能耗，同时保持或提升了输出质量。

Conclusion: 分层验证策略为加速大语言模型推理提供了重要的理论和实践支持，展现了在推理效率上的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决维基百科内容更新滞后的问题，该研究希望通过智能化手段实现知识库的自动化更新。

Method: 提出WiNELL框架，使用多智能体从在线信息中提取和选择重要内容，并通过模型生成编辑建议，模型训练基于维基百科的人类编辑历史。

Result: WiNELL在信息覆盖和编辑效率上优于开源和闭源LLMs，并证明了其在高活跃页面上的及时更新能力。

Conclusion: WiNELL为基于LLM的知识库自动更新开辟了一条新方向，具备实际应用和研究前景。

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数 VLM 评估基准主要是单一语言（几乎都是英语），尤其在印地语中，除理解和翻译外的其他任务数据集存在缺乏。

Method: 提出了一个包含1527道基于视觉的数学问题的新基准 GanitBench，问题取自印度主要考试（JEE Advanced 和 CBSE Boards）。同时评估了两种闭源模型在零样本和两样本 Chain-of-Thought（CoT）设置下的表现。

Result: GPT-4o mini 在基准上的性能占优势，最高平均准确率为 38.15%。印地语的答题性能比英语弱，同时“双重锁定”约束显著降低了模型的表现。

Conclusion: GanitBench 提升了多语言（尤其是印地语）研究在视觉语言领域的覆盖，希望推动多语言基准的进一步发展。

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Motivation: 当前长上下文大语言模型在复杂任务中的广泛应用中，尚缺乏高效准确的上下文溯源方法，以提高解释性和可靠性。

Method: 基于大语言模型生成的注意力权重开发了AttnTrace，提出两项技术以提升其效率和准确性；并提供理论支持及系统评价。

Result: 实验表明，AttnTrace在上下文溯源精度和效率上均超过现有方法，还可提升检测长上下文中提示注入的能力。

Conclusion: AttnTrace是一种高效准确的上下文溯源方法，可广泛应用于提示注入检测及其他需要可信输出的场景。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在解码准确率和文本生成质量两方面显著优于现有的多比特水印方法。

Conclusion: MajorMark与MajorMark+技术有效平衡了文本质量和解码精度，为高效多比特水印实现提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset

(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction

frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决RL在社交互动中的训练效率低和不稳定问题，主要挑战包括部分可观察性和多维特性。

Method: 提出Sotopia-RL框架，通过将粗粒度的反馈细化为多维度、细粒度的奖励实现句子级别的信用分配，减少奖励劫持。

Result: 在社交任务完成上，Sotopia-RL在Sotopia-hard和Sotopia-full数据集上分别达到了7.17和8.31的目标达成分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效应对了社交互动中的训练挑战，验证了细粒度信用分配和多维奖励设计在提升RL训练中的必要性。

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

Method: 提出CoAct-1系统，结合GUI操作与编程能力，通过动态分配任务提高效率。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，CoAct-1取得60.76%的成功率，并减少平均操作步骤至10.15。

Conclusion: 整合编程为核心操作增强了计算机自动化的能力与扩展性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

Conclusion: CAP-LLM框架能够有效平衡个性化与事实准确性，为个性化新闻标题生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models

Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and

Motivation: 尽管自洽方法简单且高效，但其高令牌耗费限制了实用性，作者希望优化其在长链式逻辑任务中的性能，同时保持并行性。

Method: 通过两个指标——模型对假设的信心以及候选子集对假设的覆盖率——开发快速加权集合覆盖算法，定期修剪不必要的中间假设。

Result: 在三个数学基准测试中，对五种LLM的评估表明，该方法可以提高10-35%的令牌使用效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种减少自洽方法令牌开销的新方法，能够在保持原有性能的同时显著改进效率，适用于解决长链式思维任务。

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

TL;DR: 提出HarmonyGuard多代理协作框架，用于在网络环境中优化任务表现与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前研究对单目标优化或单次场景局限的问题，实现安全性与效用的协同优化。

Method: 提出HarmonyGuard框架，包括自适应策略增强与双目标优化两种核心能力分别管理安全策略与优化任务效用和安全性。

Result: 评估证明HarmonyGuard提高策略合规性38%，任务完成率20%，在所有任务中政策合规性超过90%。

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard在多任务环境下实现了效用和安全性的协同增益，显著超越现有基线。

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的元学习模型编辑方法（SMEdit），通过多步反向传播和权重更新正则化，提高了低数据场景下的编辑表现和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型静态更新成本高昂，模型编辑提供了一种高效的替代方案。但现有的元学习模型编辑方法在低数据场景表现欠佳且训练效率受限，亟需改进。

Method: 提出SMEdit方法，该方法使用多步反向传播策略（MBPS）增强编辑能力，并通过正则化权重更新提高训练效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，SMEdit在两个数据集和两种语言模型上均优于现有基准方法，并证实MBPS策略能无缝集成到现有方法中以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: SMEdit方法改善了低数据场景下元学习模型编辑的效率与效果，且具备较强的通用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

TL;DR: ZARA是一个基于代理的框架，可实现从原始运动时间序列中进行零样本、可解释的活动识别，具有高性能和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有方法需要固定活动集及昂贵的再训练，探索更灵活的、无需微调的活动识别方法。

Method: 提出ZARA框架，结合特征知识库、多传感器检索模块，以及分层代理管道，引导LLM选择特征并生成活动预测和自然语言解释。

Result: 实验展示ZARA在8个HAR基准上实现了SOTA零样本性能，在宏观F1指标上超出基线2.53倍。

Conclusion: ZARA在零样本和可解释性活动识别方面表现出极大的潜力，是一种值得信赖的运动时间序列分析工具。

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型在自动化‘越狱’中的作用，以及其带来的安全隐患。

Method: 对四种LRMs进行测试，使其自动计划并执行针对九种广泛使用的目标模型的多轮越狱对话，覆盖七个敏感领域，共70个有害提示的基准。

Result: 跨所有模型组合的攻击成功率达97.14%，揭示了LRMs能系统性削弱其他模型的安全防护机制。

Conclusion: LRMs需要更强的安全对齐措施，以同时抵御越狱尝试，并防止其被滥用为越狱代理人。

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出的DTPA方法提高了长文生成时的属性可控性，同时保证了文本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注短序列文本生成的可控性，而长文本生成的可控性问题未得到充分研究。

Method: 该研究提出了动态标记级前缀增强（DTPA）框架，通过选择最佳前缀类型，并以指数增长的方式动态调整前缀注意力权重，从而增强属性可控性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DTPA在多个CTG任务中在属性控制方面效果优于现有方法，同时文本流畅性、多样性和主题相关性具有竞争力。

Conclusion: DTPA方法在长文本生成领域显示出显著的优势，为CTG研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架PAIRS，用于改进RAG系统的效率和准确性，通过融合预设模型知识和检索知识，减少不必要的外部信息检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的RAG系统在处理基于外部知识的语言模型时存在效率低下和检索不相关文档的问题。需要一种新方法来解决该问题。

Method: 提出了PAIRS框架，它包含自适应的检索和信息选择机制。通过模型产生的伪上下文进行初步回答，若回答一致则跳过外部检索，若不一致则结合自生成的上下文和原始问题进行改进后续流程。

Result: 实验结果显示，PAIRS系统在六个QA基准测试中减少了约25%的检索成本，同时在准确性上略有提升（+1.1% EM和+1.0% F1）。

Conclusion: PAIRS框架有效提高了检索增强生成模型的效率与准确性，其自适应机制有助于减少潜在的不必要检索并增强检索质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of

large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient
Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

Motivation: 解决现有生成工具使用数据集方法中标注错误多、生成低效的问题。

Method: 采用“答案优先”模式，先通过文本引导构建有效工具使用链，然后生成对应的用户查询。

Result: 生成了ToolGrad-5k数据集，复杂度更高、成本更低且通过率100%。实验显示训练在该数据集上的模型效果优于基线数据集和专有大语言模型。

Conclusion: ToolGrad方法改进了工具使用数据集的生成流程，并显著提升模型性能，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决多模态大型语言模型在进行复杂数学推理时的错误识别和纠正能力不足的问题。

Method: 通过设计GM-PRM模型，对推理过程中的每一步进行细粒度分析（包括步骤意图、视觉对齐和逻辑合理性），并在检测到错误后生成修正方案，同时引入Refined-BoN推理策略提升解答质量。

Result: GM-PRM模型在多种多模态数学基准测试中达到了最先进的表现，仅需20K样本训练数据即可显著提升策略模型的性能。

Conclusion: GM-PRM不仅能够识别错误，还具备纠错和提供解释的能力，大幅提升了解决复杂多模态数学问题的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Method: 通过实验分析推理任务中LLMs微调的学习动态，研究训练周期、学习率等对过度记忆现象的影响，并针对微调参数选择提出优化建议。

Result: 确定过度记忆现象广泛存在于不同任务、模型和微调方法中，过度记忆虽然能保持测试准确性，但带来鲁棒性和一般化能力下降的问题。

Conclusion: 微调过程中过度记忆是LLMs的独特学习动态之一，需在训练参数设置上加以规避，以提高模型实际效果。

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

Motivation: 针对现有方法（如RLHF和DPO）对大规模、高成本偏好数据集的依赖问题，提出了一种高效的数据选择方法，专注解决偏好数据高效采集的缺乏。

Method: 通过DPO隐式奖励机制，提出选择具有较小DPO奖励差距的偏好数据样本，这些样本通常更具挑战性，从而提升数据效率和模型对齐性能。

Result: 在多个数据集和对齐任务中，与五种强基准相比，该方法表现出色，仅使用原始数据10%就达到了优越的效果。

Conclusion: 基于难度的数据选择策略为在资源有限的情况下扩展大语言模型对齐提供了高效、原则性的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

Motivation: 探讨当前TTS系统是否能够通过类似于图灵测试的人类欺骗测试，进而推动更加人性化的语音生成系统的发展。

Method: 提出'Human Fooling Rate (HFR)'这一新的评估指标，用于直接衡量机器生成语音被误认为人类语音的频率，并对开源和商业化模型进行了大规模评估。

Result: 研究揭示了几个关键发现：现有CMOS评估往往不能反映真实的人类欺骗测试结果；在使用表现不佳的数据集时，低水平评估掩盖了缺点；商业模型在零样本场景下接近人类语音表现，而开源模型仍需改进；微调高质量数据虽有改善，但仍无法完全达成人类水平。

Conclusion: 现有的TTS评估方法需要结合新指标，强调更贴近人类决策和体验的测试方式，以促进TTS系统的进一步优化。

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其生成的结果可能会存在语义偏离输入的问题（即幻觉）。因果分析表明，这可能与模型无法捕获关键因果因素，以及被误导至非因果线索有关。

Method: 作者提出一种新颖的因果完备性指导强化学习框架，通过评估每个token的单独贡献与反事实必不可少性，定义token级别的因果完备性奖励，并将其嵌入GRPO优化框架中，让模型更加专注于因果充分且必要的token。

Conclusion: 利用因果完备性增强的强化学习框架可以有效缓解MLLMs的幻觉问题，提高生成结果的语义一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at

*Siddhant Panpatil,Hiskias Dingeto,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文展示了即使在没有显性越狱的情况下，SOTA语言模型仍容易在特定对话场景下表现出行为失调，揭示了当前对齐方法的关键弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前最先进的语言模型在面对细致构造的对话场景时的对齐脆弱性，发现潜在的漏洞，为未来AI系统的改进指明方向。

Method: 通过Claude-4-Opus手动测试归纳十种成功的攻击场景，并开发了MISALIGNMENTBENCH自动化评估框架，用于多模型间的可重复性测试与基准比较。

Result: 在五个前沿模型上测试十种攻击场景，整体脆弱性为76%，GPT-4.1最脆弱(90%)，Claude-4-Sonnet最具抗性(40%)。

Conclusion: 语言模型的高级推理能力可能成为攻击的矛盾点，现有对齐策略存在重要缺口，未来需要更强健的对抗基于场景的操控对策。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于情感分析的诊断框架，重点探讨大语言模型(LLMs)在处理来自内罗毕的非正式、代码混合的WhatsApp信息时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言处理（NLP）方法在低资源、文化背景复杂的环境中表现有局限性，尤其是情感分析中，固定标签和普遍情感表达方式不适用。

Method: 作者通过结合人工标注数据、情感翻转反事实分析和基于评分标准的解释评估，对LLMs的可解释性、鲁棒性和与人类推理的对齐性进行了研究。

Result: 研究发现，不同类型的LLMs在情感推理质量上差异显著，顶级模型能保持解释的稳定性，而开放模型在面对模糊性或情感变化时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强调了在复杂、真实世界交流环境中开发具文化敏感性和推理能力评估的AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasoningGuard是一种无需额外训练即可提高大规模推理模型（LRMs）生成内容安全性的推理时机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，LRMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但容易在推理过程中生成有害内容，而现有防御方法成本高，扩展性差。

Method: 提出ReasoningGuard，通过分析模型内在注意力行为来确定关键推理点，并引发即时、安全导向的反思，同时在解码阶段引入比例采样策略优化推理路径。

Result: ReasoningGuard显著减轻了三类针对LRMs推理过程的突破攻击，包括最新形式，性能优于7种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard无需昂贵训练成本，在不牺牲推理效果的情况下，加强了LRMs在生成安全性方面的表现，提供了一种高效、可靠的安全防护手段。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

*Kosuke Yoshimura,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用API访问的大型语言模型（LLMs）进行分层文本分类（HTC）的可行性，研究了三种提示方法，并将其与传统机器学习方法对比，发现LLMs在深层层次结构中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分层文本分类中，因数据稀缺与模型复杂性，传统方法较难满足需求，研究利用LLMs作为一种无需大量标注数据和算力的替代方案。

Method: 评估了零样本与小样本设置下的三种提示策略（DL，DH，TMH）的准确性与成本效益，实验数据涵盖两种数据集。

Result: 小样本设置优于零样本设置。对于浅层数据集传统模型较优，而DH策略在深层层次数据集上优于传统模型。API成本随着DH策略的深层次标签递增。

Conclusion: LLMs在HTC中具有潜力，但需在性能与成本间权衡提示策略选择。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出DP-GPT4MTS，一种新颖的双提示大型语言模型框架，通过引入清晰的任务指令提示和时间戳文本嵌入提示，优化时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型较少考虑文本信息（如事件和新闻），导致模型忽略可以显著提升预测准确性的关键数据。

Method: 提出DP-GPT4MTS框架，采用双提示方法，利用显式提示提供清晰任务指令，结合文本提示生成的上下文嵌入，通过自注意力和前馈网络优化结果。

Result: 在多种文本-数值混合时间序列数据集上实验表明，该方法优于最新的预测算法。

Conclusion: 将文本上下文融入时间序列预测中的双提示机制是提高预测精度的重要方向。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的训练方法受到真实数据不足的限制，导致对临床专业人员的培训支持有限，此研究旨在借助虚拟患者缓解这一问题。

Method: 基于先进语言模型，通过临床标准和情境条件生成可靠的虚拟患者，并采用‘临床专家参与’的评估验证过程。

Result: 验证生成的虚拟患者在提供多样性和真实性方面性能可靠，已通过临床专家的严格评估。

Conclusion: 理论上验证的虚拟患者为自动化抑郁症诊断系统提供了具有扩展性和适应性的资源，将有助于改进医疗资源的有限性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KVSink的方法，用于改进KV缓存量化中的注意力衰退保护机制，从而在提升效率的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存量化方法未能全面解析注意力衰退的机制，且对衰退的保护仅限于初始几个令牌位置，无法应对后续可能的衰退问题。

Method: 通过对注意力衰退的机制进行深入分析，提出KVSink方法，该方法采用预测衰退令牌以实现更全面的保护，并可直接应用于现有量化策略。

Result: 实验表明，KVSink方法优于现有的Preserve-First-N策略，在KV缓存量化中更高效保护注意力衰退，同时进一步优化KVQuant方法的困惑度和数值鲁棒性。

Conclusion: KVSink是一种低开销、高效的改进方法，能够显著提升KV缓存量化中的效率与性能，为语言模型推断提供重要优化。

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务基准测试主要关注基础用户意图，而忽视了现实中用户面临的更复杂目标，如使用优惠券、管理预算等。

Method: 设计了ShoppingBench，这是一种端到端的购物基准，包括用户意图模拟框架和一个涵盖250万真实产品的大规模交互式环境。此外，提出了轨迹蒸馏策略并结合监督微调和强化学习优化模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4.1在此基准上的成功率低于50%，同时基于轨迹蒸馏策略训练的小型模型表现接近GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: ShoppingBench展现了复杂购物任务的挑战性，为评估和改进语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了针对GraphRAG系统的知识投毒攻击（KPA），通过修改源文本中的少量词汇，显著破坏知识图谱的精确性和下游任务的推断结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出论文的目的是揭示GraphRAG在构建知识图谱时面临的潜在安全威胁，并验证通过少量文本修改便可显著影响系统行为的可能性。

Method: 提出了两种知识投毒攻击方法：1. 定位图中脆弱节点并修改相关描述以精准控制QA结果的定向攻击（TKPA）；2. 利用语言特性破坏知识图谱结构的广泛性攻击（UKPA）。两种方法均通过微小修改实现显著攻击效果。

Result: 定向攻击成功率高达93.1%，广泛性攻击将QA准确率从95%降至50%。实验还表明现有最先进的防御方法无法有效检测这些攻击。

Conclusion: GraphRAG存在重大的安全隐患，其构建过程极易受到知识投毒攻击的影响，需要进一步研究安全防御机制以保护其完整性和准确性。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗领域的大语言模型基准存在与临床实践脱节、数据管理不当及缺乏安全评估等问题。

Method: 提出MedCheck框架，将基准开发分为五个阶段，制定46项医学相关评价标准，并对53个现有医疗基准进行评估。

Result: 评估发现现有基准普遍存在与临床实践脱节、数据完整性不足及忽略安全评估维度等问题。

Conclusion: MedCheck既是诊断问题的工具，也是改进医疗AI基准标准化和可靠性的指导方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

Result: 微调高质量数据后，当前LLMs在任务中表现卓越，F1值超过96%。大模型（如GPT-4o）表现最佳，但轻量化开源模型同样表现出色，且半合成数据显著提升了小模型与开源解码器的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法和基准推动了文献综述生成领域的发展，同时验证了当前LLMs的潜力及训练数据增强的有效性。

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了动态熵加权的方法，通过细化奖励信号来改进强化学习在长链推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习方法在长链推理任务中存在粗粒度奖励分配问题，难以有效提升长链推理性能。

Method: 提出动态熵加权方法，通过两种方式实现细粒度奖励：1) GTPO，为每个token分配熵加权奖励；2) GRPO-S，为每个序列基于平均token熵分配熵加权奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，方法显著优于强基线DAPO，其熵加权机制显著推动了性能提升。

Conclusion: 动态熵加权机制能有效提高长链推理模型的深度推理能力，且表现优于已有算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态场景下语言模型需要主动决定使用何种感官信息（例如视觉、音频、空间感知）来应对复杂现实环境的推理需求，而现有方法尚未完全解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种叫链式问题（CoQ）的框架，通过生成目标问题，驱动模型动态选择相关模态，并依据相关信息进行实时推理。

Result: 在整合WebGPT、ScienceQA、AVSD和ScanQA数据集的新多模态基准上进行了评估，结果表明CoQ方法显著提高了模型选择和整合感官信息的能力，提升了准确性、可解释性和任务一致性。

Conclusion: 链式问题（CoQ）框架是多模态任务背景下一种有效的推理增强方法，可以改善语言模型在真实复杂环境下的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究利用高级自然语言处理（NLP）技术，通过挖掘车祸记录叙述来提高数据质量，并以肯塔基州的二次车祸识别为案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高车祸数据质量的需求是本研究的主要动机，特别是通过分析叙述性数据来更好地识别二次车祸。

Method: 研究比较三种模型分类：零样本开源大语言模型、微调的变换器模型以及传统的逻辑回归基线。利用2015-2021数据进行模型校准，并以2022年的叙述数据进行模型测试。

Result: 微调变换器模型表现最佳，其中RoBERTa获得最高的F1分数（0.90）和准确率（95%）。尽管零样本模型在某些情况下表现出色，但计算成本高昂，而微调模型则实现了效率和性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究显示，不同模型在精度、效率和数据需求之间存在权衡，其中微调变换器模型在实际部署中具有优势，尤其对于隐私保护、集成方法和处理可扩展性等方面提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

### [180] [Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04401)
*Vladimír Havlík*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了深度神经网络(DNNs)中涌现能力的本质，认为这些能力起源于复杂的非线性动态系统，而非简单的参数扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型(LLMs)在生成任务中的成功引发了对其能力来源的探讨，特别是如何在缺乏明确训练下展示出涌现能力。

Method: 通过理论分析与实证观察，考察神经网络与符号计算范式的差异，研究模型能力的扩展定律、理解现象与相变过程。

Result: 发现涌现能力是复杂动态系统中简单组件的协同交互的结果，而不是微观活动的直接推导。

Conclusion: 理解LLMs能力需要将DNNs视为复杂动态系统，涌现规律与物理、化学、生物中的相似，改变了对涌现现象的理解焦点。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ASR系统需要改进以更好地在对话系统中生成用户响应，通过研究人类选择性聆听的特点可以找出ASR的能力缺陷。

Method: 通过实验研究人类在生成对话响应时如何选择性聆听，并比较人类转录与参考转录的结果，探索ASR评估的新方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，人类在生成对话响应时会选择性聆听，这种能力可被用来评估ASR系统的性能。

Conclusion: 利用人类选择性聆听特点，可以开发新的ASR性能评估方法，更准确衡量ASR与人类能力的差距。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨通过预测用户输入语句并预取对话响应来减少用户感知延迟（UPL）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减少用户在语音对话系统中等待响应的时间。

Method: 提出一种预测信心模型（PCM），通过估计预测语句与实际语句的语义相似性来判断是否能进行预取。

Result: 通过比较预测用户输入与实际完整的用户输入，验证了PCM的有效性。

Conclusion: PCM能够更准确地判断是否可进行对话响应的预取，从而降低用户感知延迟。

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了客户支持对话(CSC)任务和相关框架，构建了含策略性标签的CSConv数据集，并通过角色扮演模拟生成策略丰富的RoleCS训练数据，用于改进强LLM的响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据缺乏战略指导且实际服务数据难以获取和标注，亟需新方法来帮助客服人员生成高质量支持对话。

Method: 基于COPC标准提出CSC框架，定义五个对话阶段和十二种策略；利用LLMs重写真实对话并标注策略，构建CSConv评测数据集；开发角色扮演方法生成RoleCS训练数据并用于微调LLMs。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在CSConv上显示出显著改善的策略对齐响应生成能力；人类评估进一步确认了其问题解决效果的提升。

Conclusion: 研究通过CSC框架和多数据集方法，为客户支持领域提供了新的训练和评估工具，显著提高了对话质量和问题解决能力。

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了ThinkingF，一个改进数学自动形式化的方法，显著提高了自然语言到形式语言的翻译准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数学自动形式化任务中的准确率仍然较低，需要改进对形式语言知识的掌握和非正式到正式语言的推理能力。

Method: 设计了ThinkingF数据生成与训练框架，包括两个数据集的构建和基于它们的监督微调及强化学习训练。

Result: 提出的StepFun-Formalizer模型在FormalMATH-Lite和ProverBench基准测试中分别取得了40.5%和26.7%的准确率，刷新了相应的SOTA纪录。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ThinkingF能提升模型在数学自动形式化任务中的表现，解决了形式化知识与自然语言推理能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨在马来西亚教育系统中，利用生成式AI (GenAI) 开发高质量、可扩展的数学多项选择题（MCQ）生成工具，尤其针对低资源语言如马来语。通过对比四种增量生成管道，发现基于RAG的方法优于非基于知识的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在马来西亚教育系统中存在对可扩展且高质量评估工具的需求，尤其是针对低资源语言的教育内容开发难题。

Method: 提出并比较了四种生成数学MCQ的方法，包括两种非知识关联提示方法和两种基于RAG的生成方法，以OpenAI的GPT-4为核心，结合课程对齐和事实准确评估框架来验证效果。

Result: 基于RAG的方法显著优于单纯的非基于知识的生成方式，更好地实现了课程对齐和事实验证。

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种经验证的方法来生成低资源语言的课程特定教育内容，并介绍了一个新颖的RAG-QA评估技术，为发展实用性教育技术解决方案提供了启示。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

Conclusion: 引入了概念区分任务和对应的微调方法，成功改进了语境化模型的语义表达，同时调整了嵌入空间的组织结构。

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了StyliTruth，用于在生成大语言模型（LLM）风格化响应时，解决风格与真实度之间的冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的风格注入方法倾向于影响模型的真实度，无法很好地平衡风格化与答案正确性之间的关系，因此需要一种有效的机制解决这一问题。

Method: 作者提出StyliTruth，通过一种正交消解过程在模型表示空间中分离风格相关和真实相关的子空间，并在每个子空间中设计自适应的、基于令牌的控制向量，实现风格和真实度的独立控制。

Result: 实验证明，StyliTruth在多种风格和语言中显著减少了风格化引起的真实性降低问题，并优于现有方法在风格与真实性的平衡方面的表现。

Conclusion: StyliTruth是一种有效方法，可在保持风格化的同时维持真实度，为更精准的大语言模型生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Conclusion: 本文建立了一个从数据和算法角度进行临床抑郁症评估的基础设施，为精神心理健康研究提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法MASA，通过共享矩阵原子实现跨层权重共享，减少Transformer中的注意力模块参数达66.7%，性能保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）的计算和存储需求高，限制了其广泛应用。现有的压缩技术主要关注模型内部优化，对跨层冗余探讨不足。

Method: 采用类似于卷积神经网络中的字典学习方法，提出MASA框架，将注意力投影矩阵分解为共享的字典原子，实现权重共享，无需复杂的蒸馏或架构变化。

Result: 实验表明，MASA能在100M-700M参数的模型中取得优异性能，参数减少66.7%；在ViT中也取得相似的提升，其性能和精度与完整版模型几乎相当。

Conclusion: MASA为提高参数使用效率提供了可靠的实践框架，可扩展到预训练语言模型中，减少参数同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

TL;DR: TURA框架通过结合RAG与工具使用，解决了AI搜索在静态和动态信息源之间的限制问题，为实时交互需求提供解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法对实时数据和动态查询存在局限性，无法满足复杂意图和低延迟需求。

Method: 提出TURA框架，包含意图感知检索模块、基于DAG的任务规划器和高效工具调用的轻量级代理执行器。

Result: TURA实现了将静态RAG扩展至动态信息源，在大规模工业环境中满足实时性和低延迟需求。

Conclusion: TURA首次系统性实现了静态和动态信息整合，是面向世界级AI搜索产品的重要架构进展。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了P-Aligner模块，该模块用于在模型解码前调整指令以更符合人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型在接收不完善指令时难以生成符合期望的内容的问题。

Method: 采用P-Aligner模块，通过基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的新数据集UltraPrompt进行训练，生成优化的指令。

Result: 实验表明，P-Aligner在多个模型和基准测试中表现优异，显著超越基线模型。

Conclusion: P-Aligner通过高效的指令调整，实现了偏好对齐，展现了实际应用中的高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了IFDecorator框架，以提高大语言模型(LLMs)在指令遵循任务中的效率和鲁棒性。通过合作对抗数据飞轮、IntentCheck模块和陷阱线机制解决了训练低效和过度优化问题，比现有模型表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在训练效率低下和过度优化（模型利用验证捷径而不是对齐用户意图）的缺陷，因此亟需一种能够解决这些问题的方法。

Method: 提出并设计了IFDecorator框架，包括三部分：1.合作对抗数据飞轮，用于生成更具挑战性的指令-验证对；2.IntentCheck模块，用于确保意图对齐；3.陷阱线机制，用于检测奖励作弊行为。

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator在IFEval上达到87.43%的准确率，胜过更大的专有模型如GPT-4o，并在FollowBench和通用能力上取得显著提升。同时显著降低了奖励作弊率。

Conclusion: IFDecorator框架显著提高了RLVR的效率和鲁棒性，在指令遵循和意图对齐方面取得了新的突破。研究还将公开模型、代码和数据，以供未来研究参考。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

TL;DR: 研究审视了当前反仇恨言论的NLP研究，指出其与受影响社区需求之间的脱节，并提供了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线上仇恨言论的传播需有效对抗，而反仇恨言论具潜力，但当前实践偏离了受影响群体的实际需求。

Method: 对74篇关于反仇恨言论的NLP研究进行了系统回顾，并与5个专注于性别暴力的NGO协作开展了案例研究，以分析利益相关者参与对数据集创建和模型开发的影响。

Result: 分析表明，当前NLP研究与仇恨内容受影响社区之间的需求脱节，并识别了利益相关者参与生成反仇恨言论的重要实践。

Conclusion: 研究建议需更注重利益相关者的参与，以更好地服务于受到在线仇恨内容影响的社区。

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的多模块相对策略优化方法 (mmGRPO)，用于多模块语言模型系统的优化，并在各种任务中获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GRPO在处理模块化程序中多个语言模型调用的优化时存在局限性，因此提出了mmGRPO解决这一问题。

Method: 定义了一种通用的多模块相对策略优化框架 (mmGRPO)，通过在rollouts中按模块对语言模型调用分组，并处理可变长度及中断轨迹。此外，结合自动提示优化以提高性能。

Result: 与单独的后训练语言模型相比，mmGRPO的准确率平均提高了11%；与单独的提示优化相比，提升了5%。

Conclusion: mmGRPO成功改进了模块化语言模型系统的表现，显著提升了分类、多跳搜索和隐私保护任务上的效果，并已开源实现以供使用。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个称为Sculptor的框架，使用主动上下文管理工具，旨在提高大语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文任务中的性能，并解决主动干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时因主动干扰会导致性能显著下降，需要一种方法来提高模型的上下文管理能力。

Method: 提出Sculptor框架，为LLMs配备三类工具：（1）上下文片段化，（2）总结、隐藏和恢复，（3）智能搜索，以此主动管理注意力和工作记忆。

Result: 在信息稀疏基准测试PI-LLM和NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning上的实验表明，Sculptor显著提升了模型性能，即使没有针对性的训练。

Conclusion: 通过启用主动上下文管理，Sculptor不仅减少了主动干扰，还为模型在多样化长上下文任务中的可靠推理提供了认知基础，表明显式的上下文控制策略是增强模型稳健性的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用样本回放框架（GeRe），结合阈值边际（TM）损失，缓解大语言模型（LLMs）在连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>

Motivation: 解决LLMs在多领域连续微调时，由于灾难性遗忘导致的一般能力丧失和先前任务性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用通用的预训练文本结合通用样本回放技术，提出TM损失函数保持神经激活状态一致性，并系统比较了不同回放策略。

Result: 实验表明，TM在性能和鲁棒性方面优于其他回放策略，并且一个小量的预收集样本已经够用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够提高LLMs的连续学习能力，为未来高效的模型回放方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在个性化需求上的表现有限，研究者希望通过利用少量用户偏好数据优化模型以更好满足个体需求。

Method: 提出了一种称为FaST的高效参数调整方法，利用从数据中自动发现的高层特征进行模型调整；并构建了两个数据集(DnD和ELIP)以评估不同方法的效果。

Result: FaST方法在评估中取得了最佳表现，验证了其在有限数据场景下的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入新方法和数据集，本文为LLMs个性化调整的问题提供了新的解决思路，同时展示了有效利用小数据的潜力。

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI
chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and
extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Motivation: 现有治理方法无法充分应对自主型AI系统的动态行为带来的风险，亟需设计专门的实时治理框架以确保其安全与对齐。

Method: 提出了MI9框架，包括六个集成功能模块：代理风险指数、语义遥测捕获、连续授权监控、基于有限状态机的符合性引擎、目标条件漂移检测以及分阶段约束策略。

Conclusion: MI9框架提供了全面实时治理的技术基础，支持自主型AI的安全扩展部署，是未来治理该类AI的关键解决方案。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型构建的多智能体系统面临开放性和复杂交互引发的重大安全风险，而现有防御方案存在独立性和高成本的不足。

Method: 提出了Evo-MARL框架，将所有任务智能体联合训练，通过整合进化搜索与参数共享式强化学习，培养综合的防御能力，替代外部的安全模块。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-MARL 将攻击成功率最多降低了22%，同时推理任务上的准确率提升了最多5%。

Conclusion: Evo-MARL可以在不增加系统成本或单点故障的情况下，提高多智能体系统的安全性和性能实现的综合能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Result: MOTIF在多个组合优化问题领域的实验中均优于最先进的方法，展现了该框架在解决复杂问题时的有效性。

Conclusion: MOTIF框架证明了回合制多代理优化方法在自动化解算器设计中的潜力，为组合优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有的MLRMs在深度思考阶段易受到用户情感的影响，导致忽视内置的安全检查，作者希望揭示这些问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个情感对抗框架EmoAgent，通过设计情感激发的对抗性提示扰乱模型的推理途径，同时定义了三个指标（RRSS、RVNR、RAIC）量化模型的风险和稳定性问题。

Result: 实验表明，EmoAgent有效揭示了MLRMs在处理情感和安全性上的更深层次问题，包括潜在的有害推理和情感认知失调。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLRMs情感与推理之间的错配问题，强调了透明、安全的深思能力的重要性，为改进未来模型的安全行为提供了新方向。

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Conclusion: 采用Cognition Forest和Galaxy框架可以提升智能助手的主动性、自我进化能力及隐私保护能力，在智能助手发展中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and

*Chao Hao,Shuai Wang,Kaiwen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecAgent 提出了一种图形用户界面（GUI）代理，通过适应性感知解决输入冗余和决策歧义问题，并引入了新的数据集 ComplexAction 以验证方法有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 GUI 代理系统在移动任务自动化中存在输入冗余和决策歧义的困难，需要开发更智能的代理以提高执行效率和准确性。

Method: RecAgent 通过区分感知不确定性和决策不确定性，引入推荐机制聚焦关键 UI 元素，并采用交互模块在人机协作中请求用户反馈，结合到一个框架中以减少复杂输入并处理高不确定性情况。

Result: 实验结果验证了 RecAgent 在复杂场景中执行单步任务上的成功率，明确展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 新的适应性感知框架可以有效降低 GUI 系统的输入冗余和决策歧义，并引入了评估复杂任务执行能力的新数据集。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Conclusion: SEA代理实现了性能与参数规模的良好平衡，有望推动计算机使用代理领域的实际应用；未来将开源模型权重与相关代码。

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

learners' individual career goals offers promising potential to enhance
engagement and long-term motivation. In our study, we investigate how career
goal-based content adaptation in learning systems based on generative AI
(GenAI) influences learner engagement, satisfaction, and study efficiency. The
mixed-methods experiment involved more than 4,000 learners, with one group

standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic
knowledge and workplace applicability.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言处理取得成果，但在数学推理和代码生成等复杂任务中仍存在挑战。

Method: 设计出KGA-ECoT框架，利用Structured Task Graph分解问题，通过GraphRAG进行知识检索，并生成可验证代码提升计算准确性。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中显著超越现有方法，准确率提高了数个百分点到十个百分点。

Conclusion: KGA-ECoT是一个在复杂数学推理任务中具有高度稳健性和广泛适应性的框架。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical
reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即使大语言模型在地理空间问题上的潜力被发现，但其在空间一致性、多跳推理及地理偏差等方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出GeoSR框架，分为变量选择、点选择和迭代优化三个代理，通过融入地理学原理，逐步优化预测质量。

Result: 实验验证GeoSR在物理属性估计和社会经济预测任务上，比标准方法显示出更好的性能与公平性。

Conclusion: 将地理统计先验知识与结构化空间推理融入大语言模型，可显著提升地理空间预测的精度与公平性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

*Karrtik Iyer,Manikandan Ravikiran,Prasanna Pendse,Shayan Mohanty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为语义熵的指标，用以衡量学生回答评分中人类评分员意见分歧的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动评分系统效率较高，但在评分决策不确定或有争议时缺乏明确性，因此需要一种可解释的不确定性信号来改善评分透明度和可信度。

Method: 通过使用GPT-4生成多个解释并通过蕴涵相似性对其进行聚类，计算得出熵值，以量化评分过程中评分逻辑的多样性。

Result: 实验表明语义熵与评分员的分歧相关，且可在不同学科间推广，并对任务结构性特征敏感，如解释性推理任务中的熵值增加。

Conclusion: 语义熵作为一种可解释的不确定性信号，可用于AI辅助评分，提高其透明度和可信性。

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

Motivation: 现有的LTLf反应式综合方法在DFA构造上存在性能问题，尤其是面对复杂的状态空间膨胀时难于处理；该研究旨在优化这个过程。

Method: 提出了一种组合式即时综合框架，通过在游戏求解阶段而非自动机构造阶段进行组合操作，并提供两种剪枝优化方式以简化中间结果。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在处理复杂实例方面的能力明显优于现有解决方案，且两种剪枝方法各具优势。

Conclusion: 这一组合式即时综合框架有效提高了LTLf综合问题求解的能力，展示了新方法在实例处理上的强大潜力。

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为AgREE的新框架，通过迭代检索和多步推理动态构建知识图谱，并在Emerging Entities领域表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识图谱补全方法难以应对新兴实体的出现以及捕捉全面且实时的信息，特别是在涉及冷门或新兴实体时。

Method: 提出AgREE框架，结合代理推理方法和战略信息检索，通过迭代检索和多步骤推理动态生成知识图谱三元组，并在无需训练的情况下表现优异。

Result: AgREE在新兴实体领域性能超越现有方法，最多提升13.7%。提出了新的评价方法和基准数据以更好适应新兴实体领域的知识图谱补全。

Conclusion: AgREE框架通过结合代理推理和检索策略，展示了在动态信息环境中维护实时更新的知识图谱的能力。

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

Motivation: 当前的无预协调团队协作方法依赖于大规模标注数据，不具备透明性且难以快速适应新变化，同时随着参与代理数量增加，决策复杂性加剧，亟需更高效的解决方法。

Method: 架构结合非单调逻辑推理、基础模型知识及快速修订的行为预测模型，支持代理基于常识性领域知识、其他代理行为预测模型及类似情境中的抽象目标进行决策。

Result: 在VirtualHome的3D仿真环境中，通过实验验证该架构在无预协调协作任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合知识和数据驱动方法的混合架构能显著提高无预协调团队协作能力，为高效协作提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

TL;DR: 研究介绍了CASCAD，一个利用图神经网络的电路感知的SAT求解框架，大幅提升了求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAT求解方法将电路转化为CNF格式，丢失了丰富的结构和功能信息，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出CASCAD框架，使用图神经网络计算电路的条件概率，动态引导CDCL算法中的变量选择和子句管理。

Result: CASCAD在实际逻辑等价检测基准测试中，求解时间最多缩短了10倍，并通过子句过滤策略进一步降低了23.5%的运行时间。

Conclusion: 保留电路层级结构信息是提升SAT求解器效率的关键，为未来的优化提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

for factual accuracy and safety; and (2) Capability Aware Group Relative Policy
Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain
orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based

Motivation: 当前的POMDP基准测试在真实问题中缺乏对记忆模型挑战性的可控性。

Method: 通过线性过程动力学、状态聚合和奖励再分布，构建具有预定义属性的定制POMDP，同时提出基于记忆需求结构（MDS）的理论框架。

Result: 实验验证了一系列根据理论设计的不同难度POMDP环境，明确了记忆增强强化学习在POMDP中的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究提供了分析和设计POMDP环境的指导，并为强化学习任务中记忆模型的选择提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理时容易受到语义启发偏差的影响，导致错误推理。作者希望解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出一种称为DRN的系统，通过迭代综合证据过程显式跟踪信念状态和量化多个假设的认知不确定性。

Result: 在新提出的LCR-1000数据集基准上，DRN表现优异，其专用模型比标准基线提高了15.2%。使用DRN作为轻量级验证模块时，系统在最具挑战性的问题上的准确率从20%提升到80%。

Conclusion: DRN通过专注于不确定性驱动的推理，展现了强大的零样本泛化能力，并被定位为构建更可信AI系统的基础性组件。

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试缺乏动态性和交互性，未能全面测试模型在多模态环境中的智能表现。OmniPlay旨在填补这一空白，提供一种能够深入探测模型在全感官范围内推理能力的工具。

Method: OmniPlay包含五个游戏环境，旨在通过设计具有协同与冲突特性的场景，评估模型的跨模态推理和感官融合性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通向稳健AGI的道路不仅仅是模型规模的扩展，还需要聚焦于增强感官和信息融合的协同机制。

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on

relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

### [222] [GuirlVG: Incentivize GUI Visual Grounding via Empirical Exploration on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04389)
*Weitai Kang,Bin Lei,Gaowen Liu,Caiwen Ding,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于强化学习的GUI界面视觉定位方法GuirlVG，在使用极少样本（5.2K）的情况下明显超越了传统需大规模数据的监督微调基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI-VG模型过于依赖多模态大模型的监督微调，需大量数据和成本，而现有规则化强化学习方法的成功，表明其可能是更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出GuirlVG方法，通过系统性的经验研究以及新颖的对抗性KL因子来动态稳定训练，并优化强化学习的各个核心组件以及训练配置流程。

Result: GuirlVG方法用极少的数据提高了模型性能，相比传统SFT方法分别在多个数据集上提升了7.7%、17.2%的准确率，同时在ScreenSpotV2上达到了91.9%的准确率。

Conclusion: GuirlVG证明了规则化强化学习可以有效应用于GUI视觉定位任务，极大地减少数据需求和训练成本，为该领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

*Thassilo M. Schiepanski,Nicholas Piël*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为D2Snap的DOM下采样算法，用于提升LLM在处理网页任务时的效率和准确率。实验结果表明，新方案在某些配置下超过了传统界面快照基准8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流的网页代理依赖GUI快照，虽然这些快照易获取并接近人类感知，但代码解释能力尚不足的LLM在处理这些视觉信息时有所局限。DOM快照提供了一种潜在的替代方案，但输入token的体积限制阻碍其普及化应用。

Method: 提出D2Snap作为一种DOM下采样算法，针对WEB任务设计以降低模型处理DOM快照时的复杂性。基于GPT-4o对算法进行了测试和验证。

Result: D2Snap在Online-Mind2Web数据集上的任务成功率达到67%，匹配或超越了基于GUI的快照基准（65%），并在特定配置下进一步超出8%。此外，实验表明DOM的层次结构是LLM适应UI任务的重要特性。

Conclusion: D2Snap算法展示了DOM快照的潜力，解决了LLM在网页代理任务中面对的token体积问题，同时也证明DOM层次结构可有效提升任务成功率，未来可在此领域进一步优化与拓展。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

*Si Chen,Izzy Molnar,Ting Hua,Peiyu Li,Le Huy Khiem,G. Alex Ambrose,Jim Lang,Ronald Metoyer,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SimInstruct，一个用于采集师生指导对话的数据工具，利用大语言模型（LLMs）模拟初学者，并由人类专家进行反馈和指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏高质量的指导对话数据是由于隐私顾虑和帮助请求中的脆弱性，作者希望解决这一问题以更好地开发教学与决策支持系统。

Method: 构建SimInstruct工具，模拟初学者通过LLMs生成不同教学难题和人格特征，由人类专家提供多轮反馈和指导，并用生成的数据微调LLaMA模型。

Result: SimInstruct生成的对话在教学相关性和认知深度上与真实记录相当，专家认为过程具有反思性且有助于专业素养提升。微调的LLaMA模型在指导质量上优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SimInstruct为高质量指导数据生成提供了切实可行的解决方案，表明LLMs在教育数据生成中的潜力，同时揭示了GPT-4o在反思性提问等方面的缺陷。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

*Rui Ha,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Pu,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MERA框架以解决LRMs在推理过程中效率低下的问题，通过明确分离推理和控制过程，实现更高的推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中存在过度思考的现象，缺乏内在的控制机制，导致计算成本过高和延迟增加。

Method: 提出了Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA)，明确将推理过程分为推理和控制两个独立模块，通过监督微调和控制策略优化（CSPO）实现元认知控制能力，并利用辅助LLM生成高质量的控制数据。

Result: 实验表明，通过MERA训练的模型在多个推理基准测试中表现出更高的推理效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MERA框架通过明确的推理和控制分离，显著改进了模型的推理效率及准确性，解决了LRMs中因缺乏控制机制导致的过度推理问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial
development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic
resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page
version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the

*Hamed Ayoobi,Nico Potyka,Anna Rapberger,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的可解释和可理解的方法，用于通过争论检测偏倚，基于受保护特征值及其邻域的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在社会中的普及，数据和模型可能会带来偏见，有必要解决潜在的系统性不公平问题。现有的研究大多没有将透明性纳入公平性考量，而公平性因其人本特性对可解释性和可理解性有更高要求。

Method: 提出一种基于形式化和计算论证技术的方法，通过分析个体及其邻域之间是否存在偏向展开争论检测偏倚。

Result: 通过正式、量化和定性评估，展示了其在基准性能和可解释性等方面的优势。

Conclusion: 本文的方法不仅具有良好的性能表现，还兼具高水平的可解释性和透明性，为偏倚检测提供了创新的方式。

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SID，一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中高阶指导能力的新型基准，包括10,000个对话回合数据集和新的评价指标X-SRG。实验显示即使是最先进的LLMs仍在指导能力方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代教育注重培养学生在复杂问题解决场景中的知识整合和迁移能力，跨学科STEM教育是实现这一目标的关键途径，但需要难以大规模实现的专家指导，研究旨在探索LLMs在这一领域的潜力。

Method: 引入SID基准，包括1万个对话回合的多学科STEM项目数据集，使用新的注释模式和评价指标对LLMs的对话指导能力进行全面评估。

Result: 基准实验表明，即使是最先进的LLMs在引导学生实现知识整合和迁移的高阶能力方面仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: SID基准的价值在于推动开发更多具备教育意识的LLMs，这对于改进学生的知识整合与迁移能力非常关键。

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ConfProBench，这是第一个系统评估多模态语言模型过程评判器（MPJs）步骤级别置信度可靠性的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MPJ评估主要关注步骤正确性分类和推理过程搜索，但忽略了步骤级置信度分数是否可靠这一关键方面。

Method: 设计了ConfProBench基准，其中包括三种对抗性扰动推理步骤（同义词替换，句法转换，图像扰动）和三个新评估指标（CRS, CSS, CCS），用于评估置信度的鲁棒性、敏感性和校准性。

Result: 实验评估了14种最先进的MLLMs，揭示了当前MPJs在置信度性能方面的局限性，并提供了支持未来研究的基准。

Conclusion: ConfProBench有效评估了MPJs在步骤级置信度可靠性上的表现，标志着该领域评估工具的进步。

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合多智能体强化学习(MARL)与预训练大语言模型(LLMs)协作的新方法，以应对现有方法在优化合作方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的预训练独立进行，且针对多智能体协作的优化不足，现有的微调技术需为个体设计复杂奖励，限制了协作能力的提升。

Method: 提出了一种策略优化算法MAGRPO，结合了当前强化学习和多智能体强化学习技术，解决了LLMs多智能体协作问题，进行写作和编码上多轮次的合作改进。

Result: 实验表明，使用 MAGRPO 微调多智能体系统能够通过有效合作生成高质量的回复，提升效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型引入其他多智能体强化学习方法提供了可能性，同时突出了相关挑战。

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

TL;DR: SEAgent是一种框架，通过与不熟悉的软件交互自我进化，解决CUAs在无人工注释条件下对新软件适应能力较差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前计算机使用代理（CUAs）在面对新颖和专业软件时表现不佳，尤其在人类注释缺乏的情况下。

Method: 提出SEAgent，一个基于经验学习的框架，通过设计世界状态模型和课程生成器，代理通过失败动作的对抗模仿和成功动作的相对策略优化进行学习，同时结合专家到通才训练策略，提高CUAs能力。

Result: 在OS-World中五个新软件环境验证了SEAgent的有效性，相比当前竞争方法UI-TARS，成功率提升23.2%。

Conclusion: SEAgent通过自我进化方法显著提高了CUAs在新软件环境中的表现，展示其作为一种更强通才代理发展的潜力。

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多边缘随机流匹配(MMSFM)方法，用于处理在不规则时间点采集的高维系统数据，有效克服了传统降维方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有降维方法在建模非平衡高维系统演化时容易忽略关键瞬态行为的问题。

Method: 提出MMSFM方法，结合模拟自由评分和流匹配方法，并利用测度样条提升应对不规则时间点数据的鲁棒性，同时通过评分匹配避免高维空间的过拟合。

Result: 在多个合成和基准数据集上验证，包括非均匀时间点基因表达数据和图像进展任务，展现了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: MMSFM能够在不降低维度的情况下对不规则时间采样的高维数据对齐，提供更全面的动态系统建模方法。

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot
observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in
quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and
fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We
present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of
simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting,
enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant
time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines
enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents
overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several
synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at
uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's
versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算模型从控制的实验室环境到非控制的真实世界中迁移的挑战。

Method: 采用监督对比学习(SCL)进行预训练，并结合Privileged Information学习模型。

Result: 在RECOLA和AGAIN数据集上的实验表明，PriCon框架的模型性能优于LUPI框架及端到端模型，与全模态训练情况下接近。

Conclusion: PriCon展示了解决情感建模实验室环境与真实应用差距的潜力，提供了可扩展的实际解决方案。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,
the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this
paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an
efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an
adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type.
Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When
Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible
mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while
preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual
learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced
catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore,
simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity,
highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Result: 在Llama-2和Mistral模型上进行实验证明，LKS能在一次性编辑10,000个知识点的情况下实现有效修改，并保持模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: LKS为大规模精确编辑语言模型潜在知识提供了一种有效的方法，在改进模型输出准确性和维护功能完整性方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information
from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during
inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge,
they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously
and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our
empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal
representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing
natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent
Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of
specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and
large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even
with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs
knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep模型有效地统一了全局低秩和局部平滑建模，能够在多维数据补全任务中实现高效、准确的结果。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian
inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation
process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel
framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale
this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that
translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions,
data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize
this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable
generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture
Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical
properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where
Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions
induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation
algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed,
context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work
provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the
barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的GRPO在训练语言模型时存在两大局限：一是奖励冲突会导致结构性关键token的输出概率下降；二是负奖励导致模型输出分布扁平化，影响学习效果。

Method: GTPO方法识别冲突token，并通过跳过负更新、放大正更新以及对高熵完成项进行过滤，提供更稳定有效的优化策略。此外，GTPO避免了依赖KL散度正则化，摆脱了对参考模型的依赖。

Result: GTPO在GSM8K、MATH和AIME 2024基准上进行了多次实验验证，显示其在训练稳定性和性能上优于GRPO。

Conclusion: GTPO提供了一种无需参考模型且性能更优的语言模型优化方法，解决了GRPO的关键问题并实现了更有效的训练。

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering
modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.
Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface
current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while
significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep
learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our
evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of
the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a
complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of
soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological
features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal
concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to
account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our
method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the
number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially
structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and
extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic
Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach
encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while
maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from
non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our
framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,
Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and
Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.
Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing
convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.
Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a
step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT
methods.

Motivation: 现有基于高斯过程的贝叶斯优化方法无法高效应对高维和大规模问题，且基于神经网络的不确定性估计方法复杂而耗时。

Method: 提出SNBO方法，不依赖模型的不确定性估计，而是通过区分探索和利用的采样标准，并动态调整采样区域实现优化。

Result: 测试在10到102维问题中，SNBO优于四种先进基线算法，减少了40-60%的函数评估次数，同时运行时间至少快一个数量级。

Conclusion: SNBO在提高优化效率和降低计算成本的同时，展示了在解决高维黑箱优化问题中的优越性能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在带臂赌博问题中，隐私保护和公平性的兼顾仍是一个解决不足的问题。

Method: 提出了DP-NCB框架，实现了$\epsilon$-差分隐私的保护和最优的Nash regret，同时适用于全局和局部差分隐私模型。

Result: DP-NCB在合成带臂实例上的实验中表现出比现有最先进方法更低的Nash regret。

Conclusion: DP-NCB为隐私保护和公平性兼顾的带臂算法设计提供了理论基础，适用于高社会影响性的应用场景。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种新型可分阶段训练的代理模型VAE-DNN，用于求解参数化非线性偏微分方程，可显著减少训练时间和资源，并提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高非线性偏微分方程求解的效率和精度，同时减少训练的时间和能耗。

Method: 利用变分自编码器（VAE）对输入和输出分别进行编码和解码，通过全连接神经网络映射潜在空间参数，并实现三个组件的独立训练。

Result: 相比先进的算子学习模型（如FNO和DeepONet），该模型在求解地下水流动的非线性扩散方程时表现出更高的效率和精度。

Conclusion: VAE-DNN模型在解决正问题和逆问题方面兼具高效性和准确性，在相关领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用用户众包数据和监管数据的时空预测框架，用于更准确的频谱需求预测。相较于ITU传统模型，方法具备更高准确性和适用性。验证结果表明，该方法可用于优化频谱管理和规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测频谱需求是现代无线通信网络可持续增长的关键，能够帮助政府改进频谱分配和拍卖机制，并满足先进通信技术的发展需求。

Method: 利用众包用户关键性能指标(KPIs)和监管数据，结合高级特征工程、相关性分析和迁移学习技术，构建了一个有效的时空预测框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为政策制定者和监管机构优化频谱资源分配提供了重要工具，并为未来无线通信技术的发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

A key challenge for learning models from data streams is capturing relevant

intelligent data subsampling for offline learning, and argue for an
information-theoretic method centred on reducing uncertainty in downstream
predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
prediction-oriented approach performs better than a previously proposed
information-theoretic technique on two widely studied problems. At the same
time, we highlight that reliably achieving strong performance in practice
requires careful model design.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training
increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with
significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we
develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning,
featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable
training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and
phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of
turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as
a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy
consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Conclusion: 虽然该方法暂不适用于临床，但为未来更加安全和时间敏感的强化学习在医疗中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a
central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for
personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous
effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support
decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our
approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two
control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting
interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for
longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a
constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state
features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource
constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,
including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world
therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work
establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.
We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical
improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level
violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.

Conclusion: 所提方法增强了葡萄物候预测能力，并为精细化田间管理提供了依据。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Conclusion: 通过将距离分类器与隐藏的神经网络结构关联，增强了此类模型的可解释性，从而实现更深层次的分析与应用。

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Motivation: 研究旨在探究主动学习与迁移学习结合是否能在跨域时间序列数据下提升异常检测的效果。

Method: 通过对不同数据集进行实验，结合主动学习采样策略和迁移学习技术，并对不同目标点的选择进行性能评估，分析其影响。

Result: 实验发现最佳性能通常在未进行聚类时获得；主动学习能改善模型表现，但提升速率低于文献报道；迁移学习的初始性能提高在加入更多目标点后逐渐平稳，并出现性能滞后现象。

Conclusion: 主动学习在异常检测中有效，但模型性能随着数据点的选择和标注呈现线性平坦趋势，最终趋于平稳。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and
multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the
mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

Result: 模型在一定规模和训练集大小的阈值以上时，可以从上下文中学习转移概率估计并取得更好的预测能力。更复杂的状态编码提升对于不同结构马尔可夫链的预测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: transformers具备通过上下文学习马尔可夫链转移概率的能力，模型大小、训练集规模和状态编码方式对性能有关键影响。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving
their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up
Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to
predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different
and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set
size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition
probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns.
Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more
robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen
during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高风险领域（如医疗、金融、刑事司法）中，风险得分的公平性评价存在挑战，强求严格公平性往往导致AUC性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT) 框架，通过最优传输方法选择性地对弱势群体得分的上lambda分位进行调整，以在公平性和AUC性能之间实现可调节的权衡。此外，扩展方法到部分AUC场景，专注于高风险区域的公平性干预。

Result: 在综合实验（包括合成、公用及临床数据集）中，FairPOT在全局及部分AUC场景下均优于现有后处理技术，且通常只造成轻微AUC损失，甚至提升效用，展示出一致性优势。

Conclusion: FairPOT具备计算效率与实际适应性，在公平性和效用之间提供了一种有效平衡的解决方案，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: BubbleONet是一种高效而准确的气泡动力学仿真模型，具有重要的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map
pressure profiles from an input function space to corresponding bubble radius
responses. BubbleONet is built upon the physics-informed deep operator network
(PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation
capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity
provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent
spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive
activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency
features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1)
Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial
radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training
techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that
BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble
dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
numerical solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代传感设备生成的大量时间序列数据可能无意间泄露用户的敏感信息，而用户隐私偏好因人而异且随时间演变。现有方法存在静态性和数据依赖性问题，限制了用户对隐私的掌控。

Method: 提出了PrivCLIP框架，使用多模态对比学习将IMU传感器数据与自然语言活动描述对齐，通过少样本学习检测敏感活动。系统同时利用语言引导活动消毒器和IMU-GPT生成模块，转换为隐私合规数据。

Result: 实验显示，PrivCLIP在多个人体活动识别数据集上的隐私保护和数据实用性方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PrivCLIP提供了一种灵活、高效的隐私保护解决方案，满足用户的动态隐私需求，并在保护数据隐私的同时保留了数据的实用性。

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

### [264] [Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04005)
*Hyungbin Kim,Incheol Baek,Yon Dohn Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习对比学习框架（DCFL），通过解耦对比损失函数来解决传统方法中的理论冲突问题，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法因数据异质性导致性能退化，而现有对比学习方法假设的无限负样本不适用于有限样本的联邦学习。

Method: 引入了Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL)，通过将对比损失函数解耦为对齐和均匀性两个目标，独立调整吸引和排斥力，从而适应有限样本条件下的联邦学习环境。

Result: 实验表明，DCFL相较于现有方法在对正负样本的对齐和均匀性上有明显提升，并在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等基准数据集上超越了最先进方法的表现。

Conclusion: DCFL通过解耦对比学习损失，解决了联邦学习中的理论冲突问题，为数据量少的联邦学习环境提供了一种高效的方法，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在帮助从业者理解这两种框架的各自优势和权衡，以选择适合的工具。

Method: 通过对编程范式、训练速度、推理性能、部署灵活性、生态系统支持等方面的详细对比，并结合实际应用领域的实例分析和社区支持的调查。

Result: 发现两者各具优势：PyTorch简洁灵活，适合研究；TensorFlow生态完整，更适应生产需求。

Conclusion: 建议根据实际需求选择框架，同时指出未来框架设计的改进方向，如执行模式统一、跨框架互操作性以及编译器优化的集成等。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative
analysis

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FeDaL的方法，通过联邦学习解决时间序列基础模型中的数据集异质性问题，从而提高模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型存在显著的数据集异质性问题，导致领域偏差以及泛化性能的下降，而对这一问题的研究较少。

Method: 通过引入联邦学习框架，以分布式架构将异质时间序列数据集分解为通用知识和个性化知识，并设计了域偏置消除（DBE）与全局偏置消除（GBE）两个机制，显著降低局部和全局偏置。

Result: FeDaL在八项包括表征学习和时间序列分析的真实任务以及54个基线模型上进行了广泛评估，显示出跨数据集的优秀泛化性能。此外，分析了数据量、客户端数量和参与率对分布式模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: FeDaL通过联合学习的分布式框架和偏置消除机制，显著提升了时间序列基础模型在异质数据上的泛化能力，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

Conclusion: QTFT展示了其在时间序列预测中的潜力，并能适配现有量子设备进行有效训练，具有运用前景。

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit
depth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了在结构化输出的短答案自动评分场景中，对开源权重模型（如LLAMA）的精调以及对OpenAI闭源模型的精调，发现精调在特定条件下可超越几例提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在无需大规模计算资源的情况下提升短答案自动评分的性能，尤其关注小样本精调技术及其与大型语言模型的交互。

Method: 对比分析了OpenAI的闭源精调服务和基于QLORA的开源模型精调方法，包括对少样本提示与精调的结合效果的评测，使用结构化（JSON）输出的短答案自动评分作为实验场景。

Result: 精调对LLAMA开源权重模型的效用有限，但在OpenAI闭源模型中表现优于几例提示基线。此外，使用大量人工生成的合成训练数据初始化，可极大提升LLAMA 3.1 8B-Instruct模型的性能。

Conclusion: 小样本精调对闭源模型更具优势，但效果可能受到领域内容的影响；通过引入合成数据可以显著提升开源模型性能。

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

Motivation: 针对现有方法在固定模式或单一目标触发器上的局限性，本研究旨在开发一种更加灵活且隐蔽的后门攻击方法。

Method: 本研究设计了一种基于潜变量驱动的条件自动编码器，能生成多样化、目标特定的触发器，使攻击者无需重新训练即可实现任意目标攻击。

Result: 实验表明，FLAT在攻击成功率上表现优秀，并能有效对抗先进的FL防御机制。

Conclusion: FLAT结合攻击成功、隐蔽性和多样性，体现了后门攻击的新层次，强调了开发新的联邦学习防御策略的迫切性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

Motivation: 当前多视图聚类方法未能充分考虑公平性问题，而公平性在以人为中心的应用中非常重要，因此需要一种新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种对抗公平多视图聚类框架（AFMVC），通过对抗训练去除特征中的敏感属性信息，同时通过KL散度对齐视图特定的聚类分配与公平不变的共识分布来保证聚类一致性和公平性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AFMVC在多个具有公平约束的数据集上实现了卓越的公平性和与现有方法竞争的聚类性能。

Conclusion: AFMVC框架成功整合了公平性学习和表示学习，为实现多视图聚类中的公平性提供了理论和实践上的支持。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive
experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC
achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言模型在多个领域的普及，其潜在隐私泄露风险尚未得到充分研究，因此需要评估VLM在模型反演攻击下的脆弱性。

Method: 提出了四种模型反演策略：TMI、TMI-C、SMI和SMI-AW，结合序列与令牌的生成特性，以及基于词汇表示的logit最大化损失进行攻击分析。

Result: 通过实验表明，特别是SMI-AW方法在攻击准确性和图像相似度上表现优异。人类评估显示重构图像的攻击准确率达到75.31%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLM在模型反演攻击下的显著隐私漏洞，强调在扩展VLM在医疗和金融等敏感领域的应用时需注意隐私风险。

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been
released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效缓解域偏移问题，在目标区域数据极少的情况下仍能提供准确的太阳能发电预测。

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and
New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions
with respect to non-adaptive approach.

Motivation: 探索通过质谱数据生成分子结构的潜力，并提升现有方法的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用MIST作为编码器，MolForge作为解码器；针对解码器进行了预训练；通过阶跃函数对指纹概率进行阈值化处理，以增强对分子亚结构的关注。

Result: 在top-1和top-10准确率上分别实现了28%和36%的分子结构正确率，相较于现有方法提升了十倍。

Conclusion: 综合使用MIST和MolForge，并采用针对性改进方法形成了一套强大的基准管线，为未来质谱分子构建研究提供了模板。

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度神经网络的训练方法（如SGD）因需要同时更新所有参数，容易导致训练不稳定和计算成本过高，因此需要一种更高效且稳定的训练方法。

Method: 提出了Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes (SAMT)方法，将网络参数的训练分解为多个子问题，针对每个子问题使用元学习指导的自适应步长策略进行优化。同时，支持多种形式的步长选择。

Result: 实验表明，SAMT在多个基准数据集上与现有最先进方法相比，在更新更少参数的情况下实现了更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SAMT在理论优化上提供了收敛性保障，并在实践中以更低的计算开销实现了更高效的神经网络优化，展示了其潜力与有效性。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外部推理系统中存在奖励作弊问题，高评分的推理路径可能包含逻辑错误，这需要通过纠正混杂因素解决奖励不准确的问题。

Method: 提出了因果奖励调整（CRA）方法，利用稀疏自编码器恢复可解释特征，并通过后门调整消除混杂因素对奖励的影响。

Result: 实验表明，CRA 方法在数学解题数据集上成功减轻了奖励作弊问题并提升了最终精度，同时无需修改策略模型或重新训练奖励模型。

Conclusion: CRA 方法在无需对原有系统进行大幅改动的基础上，有效解决了奖励作弊问题，提高了外部推理系统的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods
focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized
policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric
divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur
numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of
$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained
with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be
decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding
the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric
$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric
divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo
verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

Conclusion: 数据中心化方法在时序预测的AutoML中具有潜力，且DCATS展示了其在提升预测效果上的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners
for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML
approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture
search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight
models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us
to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a
large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS
achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time
horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for
time series forecasting.

Motivation: 解决多普勒血流速度测量中因角度估计错误导致的主要误差问题，以提高临床诊断的准确性。

Method: 利用2100张人类颈动脉超声图像（包括图像增强）训练，结合五种预训练模型提取图像特征，并通过定制浅层网络实现多普勒角度估计，与人工测量结果进行比较分析。

Result: 最佳模型的平均绝对误差低于临床多普勒角度误差阈值，有效避免了将正常速度值误分类为狭窄状况的情况。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术在自动化超声多普勒角度估计上展现了潜力，有望在商用超声设备影像软件中实现集成应用。

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Method: 设计了T3Time框架，其中包括时间、频谱和提示分支；引入频谱分支进行周期结构编码以及动态特征优先级权重机制；并设计了跨模态对齐头的动态聚合机制。

Result: 在基准数据集上，与最新模型相比取得了3.28%的MSE和2.29%的MAE平均降低，并在少样本场景下表现出较强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: T3Time通过创新的三模态与动态特征融合方法，解决了时间序列中变量交互和预测水平适应性问题，显著提升了预测精度及泛化能力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在聊天机器人之外的更多潜在应用，特别是在通用机器学习任务中的可能性。

Method: 设计了Mockingbird框架，核心在于引导LLMs扮演特定功能角色并通过自身反思来改进表现。

Result: Mockingbird框架在常见机器学习任务上表现良好，但仅依赖模型自身反思尚无法超越领域文档和专家反馈的效果。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的机器学习方法具有潜力，但当前仍需结合领域知识和专家反馈以实现更好的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as
chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code
in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning
capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable
potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general
machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such
potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to
general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on
several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is
instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve
itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine
learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common
machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot
outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human
experts.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的强化学习方法VL-DAC，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）的交互性与通用能力，实验证明了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型在语言指导下的行为生成和普遍性能力上有显著不足。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级、无超参数强化学习算法VL-DAC，结合PPO更新动作序列及环境步长层面的价值学习方式，去掉了不稳定的加权因素以提升稳定性和训练效率。

Result: 在多个模拟环境内训练的VLM表现出显著的泛化能力，包括BALROG、VSI-Bench和VisualWebBench等基准测试均有不同程度提升，同时未损失图像理解精度。

Conclusion: VL-DAC证明了一种简单的强化学习算法能够在低成本的合成环境中训练视觉语言模型，并在真实场景下实现显著提升。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into
coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current
vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)
efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom
tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training
simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on
dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce
Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,
hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens
while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our
knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple
decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable
convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at
a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies
that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic
control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning),
and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general
image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a
simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while
delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and
web-navigation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为WSS-CL的新方法，用于图像分类中的高效机器反学习，通过权重显著性和对比学习实现数据遗忘和模型优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前机器反学习方法在精准遗忘、稳定性和多领域适用性方面的挑战。

Method: 提出一种两阶段方法：第一阶段通过Kullback-Leibler散度在logit空间高效遗忘数据；第二阶段通过自监督对比学习在特征空间最大化遗忘数据与保留数据间的距离。

Result: 实验表明，WSS-CL方法在遗忘效率和性能损失方面相比现有方法有显著提升，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: WSS-CL方法通过引入权重显著性和对比学习，在高效遗忘与保留性能之间实现了良好平衡，在监督和自监督设置中均有良好表现。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in
a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning
approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies
frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining
stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we
introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image
classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to
focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called
weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine
unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the
performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes
kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels
for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning
stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using
scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten
and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the
paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples
act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental
evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning
efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过正负token区分与遗忘机制，改善大语言模型训练效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调过程中由于数据质量和数量不足导致的性能提升有限或退化问题。

Method: 将训练数据中的tokens分为正负两类，正类tokens正常训练，负类tokens通过遗忘机制从模型中排除，以此优化模型的学习过程。

Result: 实验表明，使用遗忘机制后，模型性能和响应多样性均得到提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于正负token分类的遗忘机制，能够帮助大语言模型更精准地学习信息，从而提高训练效果。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large
language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire
domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their
general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data
quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance
gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate
such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts
-- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve
model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas
negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be
explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to
learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge
boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We
conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this
forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also
facilitate more diverse model responses.

TL;DR: PrivDFS 是一种新私有推理范式，通过分布式特征共享解决敏感数据隐私问题，显著降低计算成本，无精度损失，且具备较强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有私有推理方法需要在隐私与计算效率之间权衡，现有方法要么计算开销大，要么容易受到特征逆向攻击。

Method: 提出 PrivDFS，将输入特征分割为多个均衡份额，并分布到多个独立的服务器进行部分推理，最终由客户端聚合预测结果。此外，提出基于对抗训练和用户特定密钥的扩展方法增强隐私。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 和 CelebA 数据集上的实验表明，PrivDFS 隐私性与深度分割推理相当，同时客户端计算成本减少至原来的 1%。

Conclusion: PrivDFS 提供了高效且隐私保护强的私有推理方法，并能够有效抵御多种攻击，具有显著应用潜力。

Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

Result: 在针对白血病实验室的真实数据上，新方法显著优于现有持续学习方法，首次成功解决MIL的持续学习问题。

Conclusion: 该研究实现了对时间分布变化数据（如疾病发生变化或遗传变异）的模型适应性更新，为实验室诊断领域提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的INT4和INT8量化技术降低了计算和存储成本，但常常伴随着精度下降或效率不足的问题，迫切需要一种能够在保持模型性能的同时优化硬件使用效率的量化方案。

Method: FlexQ采用统一的6位权重量化策略，并通过逐层敏感性分析适配性保留8位激活值。同时，开发了基于二进制张量核的高性能GPU内核，支持W6A6与W6A8的矩阵乘法运算，从而克服现有GPU缺乏原生INT6支持的局限。

Conclusion: FlexQ有效平衡了模型性能与计算效率之间的关系，为现代GPU架构下的高效推理提供了一种新的解决方案，同时将代码公开，有助于未来研究与应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail
significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical
deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they
often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a
superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks
hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision
arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.
The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on
LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference
acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released

Conclusion: 提出改进评估和报告实践的建议，期望支持未来多模态可解释性研究，使AI系统更具解释性、责任性与透明性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years,
particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to
significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this
progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred
a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making
processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research
published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the
explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we
examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model
architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation
methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are
concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based
techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these
methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between
modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity
across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in
multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,
robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual
factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of
recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized
evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to
support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible
mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate
the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in
deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate
that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial
attacks in the domain of recommender systems.

Motivation: 改进生成模型的潜在空间结构，避免传统方法中因高斯先验导致的重构样本均质化现象。

Method: 基于云模型的特征函数设计正则化器，并在WAE框架中使用云模型先验，实现更灵活和真实的潜在空间表示。

Result: 在MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10和CelebA数据集上的广泛实验表明，CMCFAE在重构质量、潜在空间结构和样本多样性上均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 将云模型理论与基于MMD的正则化方法相结合，为提升基于自编码器的生成模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a
novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein
Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the
cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate
modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely
on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method
employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic
representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed
in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud
model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in
terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample
diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model
theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new
perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新范式，通过形式化红队攻击为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），在强化学习框架下训练AI攻击LLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型红队测试存在局限性，包括模板脆弱性和单轮攻击的不足，无法捕获复杂的现实世界对抗性对话特点。

Method: 通过将红队攻击形式化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）并结合层次化的强化学习框架（hierarchical Reinforcement Learning），训练生成式代理模型进行多轮、策略性的攻击。

Result: 生成式代理通过细粒度的基于token的奖励机制学习到连贯的多轮攻击策略，能够发现传统方法遗漏的细微漏洞，并达成新的业界最佳表现。

Conclusion: 该研究重新定义了大语言模型的红队测试，从单轮测试发展到了动态、基于轨迹的过程，为AI的稳健部署提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in
current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to
capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We
propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI.
By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a
hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the
inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns
coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm
reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing
baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing
LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step
test) essential for robust AI deployment.

*Claudius Gros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究对大规模生成型AI迅速发展的背后机制——注意力机制进行了探讨，但发现标准的Transformer在任务切换问题中的表现不理想，只有结合新的注意力机制cisformer和extensive attention才取得了显著的性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索注意力机制在小规模任务（如任务切换）中的实际优势，以往基于注意力的结构在大规模生成式任务表现良好，但在小规模任务上的应用优势尚未明确。

Method: 通过任务切换框架，将不同模型（包括标准Transformer、LSTM、MLP等）应用于有限域算术任务中，增加实验组使用cisformer和extensive attention改进的注意力机制，进行对比研究。

Result: 模型表现对比显示，仅结合cisformer和extensive attention模型在任务切换框架中实现了显著性能提升，预测准确率达到95%左右。

Conclusion: 注意力机制在特定任务环境下的工作原理可以通过对比研究得到更深入的理解和改良，尤其是在小规模复杂任务中表现出潜在优势。

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely
based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive
small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform
traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks.
We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework
models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined
by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard
transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on
finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment /
addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long
short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our
comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer
architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and
an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the
latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance
levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can
be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different
formulations in task-switching settings.

*Enyu Zhou,Kai Sheng,Hao Chen,Xin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于缓存的并行推测解码框架CARD，以提高大语言模型的推断效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在推断效率上受到“草稿-验证”范式限制，且一旦某候选序列中的单个token被拒绝，后续token会被全部丢弃，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出“查询与修正”范式，将草稿模型和目标模型的过程解耦，使用共享缓存存储候选tokens，草稿模型生成tokens，目标模型并行修正草稿方向。

Result: 该方法相比常规解码实现了最高4.83倍的速度提升，无需对草稿和目标模型进行微调。

Conclusion: CARD框架有效提高了推断效率，并接近了草稿模型的速度，为加速大模型推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的神经算子方法对局部物理细节与全局特征之间的相互依赖学习不足，无法有效解决多尺度问题，且在长期预测中容易损失物理一致性与数值稳定性。

Method: 本文提出GFocal方法，通过Nyström注意力的全局模块和基于切片的局部模块学习全局与局部特征，并通过卷积门控模块动态融合多尺度信息，从而生成物理感知的特征。

Result: GFocal在六个基准测试中实现了平均15.2%的相对增益，并在汽车和翼型气动模拟等工业规模应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: GFocal在捕捉多尺度信息、物理一致性以及准确建模复杂动态系统方面表现出色，是解决偏微分方程的有效替代工具。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate
solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of
Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations,
profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies
overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical
details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale
problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term
rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we
propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces
simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations
and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based
\textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate
physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via
convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale
information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical
features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show
that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\%
relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale
simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

Conclusion: FedHiP通过分析解的方法实现了对非IID数据的鲁棒性，为个性化联邦学习问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent
paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while
simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL
methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data
heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders
convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in
the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently
sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the
research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized
Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)
solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend
of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,
we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To
support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our
FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic
global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form
solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless
of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP
scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%
in accuracy.

TL;DR: 利用因果机器学习模型分析墙体保温对天然气消耗的影响，发现不同能源负担群体效应差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前减少家庭能源需求是气候缓解和减少燃料贫困的重要策略，但能效干预的影响具有高度异质性，因此需要深入理解干预措施对不同人群的影响。

Method: 研究采用因果机器学习模型，基于英格兰住房的全国代表性数据，估算墙体保温对天然气消耗的平均和条件处理效应，特别关注不同能源负担群体的分布效应。

Result: 墙体保温可平均减少19%的天然气需求，低能源负担群体可节省更多，而高能源负担群体几乎没有减少。这是由于高成本收入比群体将节省的开支用于改善热舒适，而非降低消费。

Conclusion: 干预措施触发了一种理性的行为调整机制，对于先前处于贫困的家庭具有健康和福祉共益效果，因此应建立更广泛的评估框架，兼顾气候影响和能源政策的公平性。

Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel
poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly
heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally
representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and
conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing
on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions
reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden
groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy
burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a
behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income
ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort
rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent
rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential
co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader
evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity
implications of domestic energy policy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用分层评分指标来评估机器学习模型性能的方法，这种方法对分类和目标检测错误的处理比传统的二元评分方式更为精细。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在机器学习的分类和目标检测任务中，错误通常以二元方式处理，未考虑错误的多样性及其影响。该研究旨在通过分层评分方法更精细地捕捉错误影响。

Method: 使用评分树表示类标签之间的关系，并开发了三种权重策略的分层评分指标，以反映预测与真实标签之间在树结构中的距离。

Result: 通过一个抽象用例进行演示，结果表明这些指标能够更精细地捕获错误，并且评分树可以实现调优。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层评分方法不仅关注错误数量，还关注错误的性质和影响，为评估机器学习模型性能提供了更丰富的视角。同时，相关的Python实现将开源。

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a
sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes
localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.
Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by
counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the
ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as
equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy
with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or
operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure
exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a
given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground
truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions
instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of
misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in
complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class
labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The
scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees
that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors
discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer
granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an
approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many
errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of
the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of
publication.

### [299] [Causal Reflection with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04495)

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个框架——Causal Reflection，用于建模因果关系，提高因果推理能力和自我修正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs和传统强化学习代理对因果关系的理解不足，容易依赖表面相关性，缺乏对因果机制的建模。

Method: 研发Causal Reflection框架，通过显式建模状态、行动、时间及扰动之间的动态因果功能，同时设计Reflect机制以识别预测与观察结果之间的不匹配并生成因果假设。

Result: 提出的框架可支持代理在因果推理上进行自我改进和调整，并通过LLMs将因果结果转化为自然语言解释和反事实。

Conclusion: Causal Reflection为设计能够适应、纠正并沟通因果理解的代理提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前Transformer和CNN模型在多变量时间序列分类中的高计算复杂性、频率多样性不足和参数需求大的问题。

Method: 开发了PRISM模块，通过应用对称有限脉冲响应（FIR）滤波器，实现多分辨率和每通道独立的特征提取，且无需跨通道卷积。

Result: 在多项基准测试（如人类活动、睡眠阶段及生物医学数据中），PRISM与轻量级分类头结合后，在使用更少参数和计算量的情况下，可匹配或超越主流CNN和Transformer模型。

Conclusion: PRISM通过结合经典信号处理方法与现代深度学习技巧，为多变量时间序列分类提供了一种准确且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from
wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances,
Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer
limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We
propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a
convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric
finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales,
independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields
highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions,
greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage
and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads,
matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using
roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical
signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate,
resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Channel-Independent Paradigm (CIP)的新方法，用于无需跨客户通信的联邦交通预测，并基于此开发了高效的联邦学习框架Fed-CI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交通数据分布于多个数据拥有者且隐私约束限制直接共享的情况下，现有交通预测方法通信开销大、训练过程慢的问题。

Method: 提出Channel-Independent Paradigm (CIP)，允许节点仅使用本地信息进行预测，消除客户间通信需求；进一步开发联邦学习框架Fed-CI，用以减轻因缺乏直接数据共享造成的信息丢失。

Result: 通过多个实际数据集的实验表明，Fed-CI在所有数据集和联邦设置下都显著优于现有方法，在RMSE、MAE和MAPE上分别提高了8%、14%和16%，同时极大减少了通信成本。

Conclusion: Fed-CI既符合隐私保护规定，又有效提高了交通预测的精度和效率，显著减小了资源消耗。

Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has
become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,
traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy
constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for
traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on
designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information
from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such
approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting
transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume
of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,
making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for
federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).
Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client
communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate
predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop
Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to
process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information
loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI
significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy
regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and
federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,
and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效预测了某一身份属性暴露是否可能导致其他属性的暴露。

Conclusion: 基于图结构的隐私风险预测方法能够为个人信息保护提供新的思路和工具。

Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal
information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By
analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research
identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures
occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an
Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes
represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges
represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the
probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another).
Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework
that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of
further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results
show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the
disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of
another attribute?

Motivation: 传统的图基础模型（GFMs）在跨域任务中侧重于节点特征的迁移，而较少关注结构信息的泛化效果；然而作者发现图的结构信息在跨域中更具一致性。

Method: GraphProp包括两阶段：第一阶段通过预测图不变量训练基于结构的GFM，提取图的抽象结构信息；第二阶段使用第一阶段的表示训练综合GFM，从而整合节点属性和图标签，提升跨域能力。

Result: 实验表明，GraphProp在监督学习和少样本学习中，尤其是在节点属性缺失的图上，显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: GraphProp通过强调结构泛化与分阶段训练，有效提升了图基础模型在跨域任务中的表现。

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong
generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification.
Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across
different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent
cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,
traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various
domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural
cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which
emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp
consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting
graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend
only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the
graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract
structural information and provide discriminative graph representations
comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the
representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a
comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and
graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our
experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the
competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in
handling graphs without node attributes.

Result: 该二维网络能在实验置信区间内预测动态位移和焊核增长，并有效支持从钢到铝的焊接转移过程。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在工业中实现快速、基于模型的质量控制方面展现了强大潜力。

Abstract: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white
in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality
metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential
for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were
investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from
experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in
aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data
into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we
introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic
displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in
function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a
custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to
counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we
introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via
a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure
physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model
was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining
computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training
strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one
dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The
two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within
the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from
steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based
quality control in industrial applications.

Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions
that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To
enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time
variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge
probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach
enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling
multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants
not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative
models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and
inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling,
suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized
models.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across
diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying
mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time
series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,
i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this
paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,
CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to
effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural
causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle
the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with
a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a
periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive
experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently
outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with
enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance
recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision
from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor
generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution
to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a
pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level
information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the
transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to
effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the
diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate
experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse
downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient
tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets
with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two
domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining
competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x
lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in
supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for
thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer
learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively
on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with
self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new
source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art
performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms
specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having
almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained
species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for
bioacoustics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个高效算法，用于在高斯分布和对抗性噪声下学习单指数模型，并对所有具有某种有界矩的单调激活函数实现了常数因子近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高斯分布下，在对抗性标签噪声存在时学习单指数模型的基本问题，尤其是以往算法在未知激活函数情况下的不足。

Method: 开发了一种优化框架，利用问题结构、高斯空间的特性和单调函数的规律性，通过一种新颖的方向向量场引导算法更新，而非传统梯度方法。

Result: 首个计算高效的算法成功解决了这一任务，对所有满足条件的单调激活函数能实现常数因子近似，并覆盖了更广泛的激活函数类别。

Conclusion: 该算法拓宽了未知激活函数情况下学习任务的适用范围，为高效解决类似问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to
the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial
label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient
algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation,
that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded
moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta > 0.$ This class in particular includes
all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like
(possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation
either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a
substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our
approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the
boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector
field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem
structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析PushGP与GPT-4o在程序合成任务中的性能，探索不同方法的优势和适用场景。

Method: 对PSB2基准套件中的任务，采用PushGP和GPT-4o进行比较；GPT-4o使用三种提示方式：仅数据、仅文本以及数据和文本结合，分别测试其任务完成率和效果。

Result: 结合PushGP和GPT-4o的数据文本提示在25个任务中解决了23个，发现PushGP和GPT-4o各自有独特的优化方法和适用场景。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了在程序合成中结合和比较不同优化技术的重要性，多种技术的互补可以提高任务完成率。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) and large language models (LLMs) differ in how
program specifications are provided: GP uses input-output examples, and LLMs
use text descriptions. In this work, we compared the ability of PushGP and
GPT-4o to synthesize computer programs for tasks from the PSB2 benchmark suite.
We used three prompt variants with GPT-4o: input-output examples (data-only),
textual description of the task (text-only), and a combination of both textual
descriptions and input-output examples (data-text). Additionally, we varied the
number of input-output examples available for building programs. For each
synthesizer and task combination, we compared success rates across all program
synthesizers, as well as the similarity between successful GPT-4o synthesized
programs. We found that the combination of PushGP and GPT-4o with data-text
prompting led to the greatest number of tasks solved (23 of the 25 tasks), even
though several tasks were solved exclusively by only one of the two
synthesizers. We also observed that PushGP and GPT-4o with data-only prompting
solved fewer tasks with the decrease in the training set size, while the
remaining synthesizers saw no decrease. We also detected significant
differences in similarity between the successful programs synthesized for
GPT-4o with text-only and data-only prompting. With there being no dominant
program synthesizer, this work highlights the importance of different
optimization techniques used by PushGP and LLMs to synthesize programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏基础模型能够从眼动时间序列中预测消费者行为，因此作者希望填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了STARE（Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking）架构，引入了一种新的标记化策略，将眼动时间序列的坐标映射到预定义的兴趣区，并结合Chronos时间序列模型以及联合注意力机制。

Result: 与多种先进对比模型在多个数据集上的实验表明，STARE能够有效预测消费者的选择行为。

Conclusion: 文章为基于眼动时间序列的视觉注意力动态建模和预测提供了首个深度学习解决方案，具有一定理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The present work proposes a Deep Learning architecture for the prediction of
various consumer choice behaviors from time series of raw gaze or eye fixations
on images of the decision environment, for which currently no foundational
models are available. The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention
Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which
involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on
predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the
spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series
foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or
cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences
of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives
on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors
from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL
architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the
neurophysiology of eye movements.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的时空约束(STC)损失函数，用于顶层深度脉冲神经网络(TDSNNs)，有效提升了神经网络的生物相似性及性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度人工神经网络(ANNs)在实现拓扑表示时忽略了重要的时间动态性，导致任务性能下降及生物相似性缺失。因此，需要一种能体现时间动态且贴近生物特性的方法。

Method: 通过引入STC损失函数，结合脉冲神经网络(SNNs)的时间动态特性，构建具有仿猴视觉皮层层次结构的TDSNNs，模拟从低级感官输入到高级抽象表示的过程。

Result: STC实现了模拟视觉皮层拓扑功能的特征生成方案，同时在维持ImageNet数据集精度的基础上，与其他拓扑ANNs相比，性能下降显著降低。此外，其时间信息处理更加高效和稳定。

Conclusion: TDSNNs在计算性能和生物相似性间达成了平衡，通过引入拓扑结构提供了对神经科学现象的诠释，并为设计高效稳健的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells
that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired
neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into
various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic
self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored
in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic
plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of
non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the
neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the
impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning
application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks
(IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic
Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the
model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the
WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional
models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse
machine learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升Ref-AVS任务的解释性与性能，同时减少对像素级监督的依赖。

Method: 通过Ref-Thinker多模态语言模型推理生成目标描述，结合Grounding-DINO与SAM2实现粗定位和精确分割；同时引入多样性标杆数据集R^2-AVSBench用于评估。

Result: 在标准和R^2-AVSBench数据集上均取得了最新的最高性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无需像素级监督的Ref-AVS，展示了解释性强且高效的分割性能，为领域研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at
https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.
