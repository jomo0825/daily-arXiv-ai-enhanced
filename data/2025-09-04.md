Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉瓣狭窄的诊断依赖传统的超声心动图，但资源限制尤其在偏远地区使得普及化困难，需寻找更高效的替代方法。

Method: 利用强化学习驱动的主动视频采集框架，动态选择最具信息量的心脏超声视频，并结合主动特征采集的方法提升诊断效率。

Result: 在2,572名患者的数据测试中，该方法实现了80.6%的分类准确率，同时视频采集量减少至原方法的47%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过优化诊断效率和准确性，展现了在规模化、个性化主动脉瓣狭窄诊断中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Result: 通过多个案例研究展示了LiGuard框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LiGuard可为研究人员快速开发激光雷达相关项目提供便捷，并促进研究成果的共享与复用。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

*Midhat Urooj,Ayan Banerjee,Farhat Shaikh,Kuntal Thakur,Sandeep Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为KG-DG的神经符号框架，用于糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）分类，结合了视觉Transformer和专家指导的符号推理，实现了对未知领域的鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型通常在受到实际分布偏移时表现不佳，亟需一种能在单一数据源条件下泛化至多领域的有效方法。

Method: 提出KG-DG框架，将临床病变本体与规则特征及视网膜血管分割相结合，并通过置信度加权的整合策略与视觉表征融合，来实现领域嵌入对齐和高层次语义一致性。

Conclusion: 神经符号整合提供了一种有前景的、能在医学AI领域中实现鲁棒性和领域不变性的精确模型构建范式。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

pivotal for a myriad of applications, encompassing environmental surveillance,
urban design, and crisis management. Leveraging RetinaNet, this work unveils
DDR-Net: a data-driven, deep-learning model devised to enhance the detection of
diminutive objects. DDR-Net introduces novel, data-driven techniques to
autonomously ascertain optimal feature maps and anchor estimations, cultivating
a tailored and proficient training process while maintaining precision.
Additionally, this paper presents an innovative sampling technique to bolster
model efficacy under limited data training constraints. The model's enhanced
detection capabilities support critical applications including wildlife and
habitat monitoring, traffic flow optimization, and public safety improvements
through accurate identification of small objects like vehicles and pedestrians.
DDR-Net significantly reduces the cost and time required for data collection
and training, offering efficient performance even with limited data. Empirical
assessments over assorted aerial avian imagery datasets demonstrate that
DDR-Net markedly surpasses RetinaNet and alternative contemporary models. These
innovations advance current aerial image analysis technologies and promise
wide-ranging impacts across multiple sectors including agriculture, security,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STAR的轻量级框架，用于高效和鲁棒的连续数字病理图像刚性配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法复杂且计算开销大，而当前缺乏足够轻量但又实用的刚性配准框架来处理连续切片场景的问题。

Method: STAR结合了染色条件预处理、分层粗到细的相关策略、自适应核缩放以及内置质量控制来实现鲁棒的刚性配准。

Result: 在ANHIR 2019和ACROBAT 2022数据集上的评估显示STAR能够在多种条件和染色方法下实现稳定对齐，每张幻灯片仅需几分钟。

Conclusion: STAR工具降低了临床采纳的门槛，为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了基础。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EdgeAttNet用于改进H-alpha观测中太阳丝状体的分割，并在MAGFILO数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对长距离依赖和空间细节（例如丝状体的须状结构）建模能力有限，影响了对太阳丝状体卷曲特征的分辨。

Method: 基于U-Net结构，提出EdgeAttNet架构，引入从输入图像中学习得到的边缘图，通过边缘信息线性变换引导注意力机制，加强对丝状体边界和细节的分割能力，同时减少了模型参数。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet的分割精度与须状结构识别明显优于U-Net和其他基于U-Net的变换器模型，并且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: EdgeAttNet通过整合结构先验和自注意力机制，提升了太阳丝状体分割的空间敏感性和精度，适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理场景动态和领域知识结合上表现不足，难以满足自动驾驶对短时间轨迹预测的高要求。

Method: 提出KEPT框架，利用TFSF视频编码器与k-means+HNSW检索模块结合，通过链式推理提示和三阶段微调，支持精确的前视轨迹规划。

Result: KEPT在多种协议下均表现出色：在NoAvg模式下实现0.70m L2误差与0.21%碰撞率；在TemAvg模式下实现0.31m L2误差与0.07%碰撞率。

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

### [15] [InstaDA: Augmenting Instance Segmentation Data with Dual-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02973)
*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的、无需训练的双智能体系统InstaDA，用于增强实例分割数据集。其通过文本智能体和图像智能体合作提高数据多样性和分布，并在LVIS 1.0验证集上表现出显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量实例分割数据获取困难，现有研究在结合Copy-Paste和扩散模型创建多样性数据集时，未能充分利用大语言模型(LLMs)与扩散模型的深度协作，以及训练数据中的丰富信息。

Method: 提出InstaDA系统，包含两个独立运作的智能体：(1) 文本智能体（T-Agent），通过大语言模型和扩散模型协作，并引入Prompt Rethink机制来迭代优化提示和图像生成；(2) 图像智能体（I-Agent），以训练图像为条件生成新实例扩充数据分布。

Result: 实验表明，在LVIS 1.0验证集上，InstaDA相比基线模型提升了框平均精度（AP）+4.0和掩码AP+3.3，并且在与先进模型DiverGen的比较中，常见类别框AP和掩码AP也分别获得+0.7和+0.2的提升，频繁类别掩码AP则提升了+0.5。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过其文本和图像智能体带来了实例分割数据增强的显著改善，展示了高效的自动化数据增强能力，特别是在提升数据多样性和优化数据分布方面表现突出。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPENet的模型，改进了现有的Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS)方法，通过多级原型生成和查询引导的局部原型增强模块提高分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有基于原型的方法无法有效处理类内差异的问题，提出改进模型以更好地进行支持图像与查询图像的匹配。

Method: 设计了多级原型生成模块（MPG），生成全局和局部原型用于多粒度匹配；并引入查询引导的局部原型增强模块（QLPE），通过查询图像指导自适应地优化支持原型，减少类间差异影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，SPENet在三个公开医疗数据集上的性能优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入SPENet方法，显著提升了Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation的性能，可以更好地处理医疗图像分割任务中的类内变异和支持-查询图像间的分歧。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出了SOPSeg框架，用于遥感影像中的小目标分割；通过改进分辨率、边缘预测和渐进优化实现了性能提升，并发布了新的数据集和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前小目标实例分割研究不足，尤其缺乏相关数据集，同时现有方法如SAM无法有效处理小目标分割的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于提示的SOPSeg框架，包括区域自适应放大策略、定制解码器（结合边缘预测和渐进优化）以及面向定向框的新提示机制。

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割性能上优于现有方法，并支持高效地构建遥感任务数据集。

Conclusion: SOPSeg不仅提升了小目标分割的准确度，还为遥感小目标分割研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后处理水印可应用于任何生成模型输出，且无需访问模型内部结构，同时允许用户为单个图像嵌入独特的水印，更具灵活性。

Method: 通过构建空间域和频域中的CNN与Transformer攻击网络的不同组合来研究其对水印模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: CNN空间域与Transformer频域攻击网络组合在提高水印模型鲁棒性方面效果最好。在WAVES基准上的广泛评估表明，该方法显著增强了基线水印方法的鲁棒性，尤其是在再生攻击中提升了StegaStamp的性能18.743%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效增强了后处理水印方法的鲁棒性，可对抗多种压力测试，具备较高的实用价值和性能改进。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released
at:https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark.

vascular pattern, bleeding, erythema, friability, ulceration) is injected as
natural-language prompts to guide caption generation. The system produces
structured, interpretable descriptions aligned with clinical practice and
provides MES classification and lesion tags. Compared with baselines, our
approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy, supporting
reliable endoscopic reporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索了大型视觉-语言模型(LVLMs)如何处理没有视觉证据的文本输入的问题，并提出了检测和改进方法，可有效减少错误响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者发现LVLMs对缺乏视觉证据的文本输入易误判为图像内容，研究动机是测试模型是否具备识别文本概念是否扎根于图像的能力。

Method: 研究发现一组称为“视觉缺失感知神经元”的FFN神经元，对视觉缺失具有独特的激活模式，基于此设计了检测模块，用以分类输入是否与图像有关，并通过优化生成过程改进模型输出。

Result: 提出的方法显著减轻了LVLMs对文本输入视觉存在的错误判断倾向，并证明了方法在多种模型上的适用性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs的内在能力，并通过提出有效方法改进了其性能，为进一步研究LVLMs的输入处理机制提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 通过结合前景与背景语义信息的跨模态学习，提出的模型有效提升了目标再识别的准确性和对复杂遮挡环境的适应能力。

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有卷积神经网络在捕捉长距离依赖关系上存在局限，而视觉Transformer虽可捕捉全局上下文，但其高复杂性和大量参数使其难以在皮肤科小样本数据集上应用。

Method: 该方法设计了一种轻量级CNN-Transformer混合网络，其中编码器通过深度移动反转瓶颈单元减少计算量，跨尺度信息交换模块整合不同分辨率信息，边界感知自注意模块用于优化分割轮廓。

Result: 实现了高精度的皮肤分割性能，同时保持了轻量级设计，适合小样本医疗数据集。

Conclusion: MedLiteNet通过结合CNN的效率和Transformer的全局建模能力，为皮肤病理分割提供了精准又高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Conclusion: 动态条件构造可以有效提升病态多任务场景下的模型学习能力，并充分展现了其在实际任务中的优势。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla
characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning
to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten
characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network
techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural
Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end
classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in
the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105
Bangla character image samples categorized into 84 distinct classes, is used
for this classification model. The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training

state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla handwritten character classification show
that the proposed model achieves better accuracy in classifying the data.

Conclusion: 与传统卷积神经网络相比，ADA-GAN能够在复杂和草书手写字符分类中更加出色，证明其效果和适用性。

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Result: 通过实验验证了此方法可使某些欺骗攻击穿过防伪检测。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了现有防伪系统的潜在风险，并强调应加强训练数据的安全性。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

### [29] [Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113)
*Shan Wang,Maying Shen,Nadine Chang,Chuong Nguyen,Hongdong Li,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于梯度的自反方法，旨在通过估计不同代币类型（视觉、提示和先前输出）的影响来缓解多模态大语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前针对多模态LLMs幻觉问题的缓解方法缺乏对实例间波动的偏差水平的理解，难以有效地解决文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差。

Method: 我们通过梯度自反方法估测代币影响，并结合影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解这两类偏差，无需额外的资源如微调、额外模型或数据统计。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少幻觉问题，在LLaVA-QA90数据集上表现为高达92%的精确度提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效处理多模态LLMs中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差问题，并以无额外开销的方式提高模型表现。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于重力场的扩散模型GravityDB，解决了手部和物体交互中常见的穿插问题和接触区间隙问题，并捕捉了现实中的手部变形效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法难以准确处理人手和物体复杂几何形状的交互，容易出现穿插或者接触不真实的情况。此外，真实的手部在交互中会发生形变，也未得到很好的刻画。

Method: 提出了一种以吸引力驱动的手-物体交互建模方法，通过GravityDB模拟可变形手部表面与刚体物体之间的交互，利用重力场引导生成物理上合理的交互态，并结合语义信息优化交互区域构建。

Result: 该方法成功生成无穿插、稳定抓握且形变真实的交互效果，并通过多个数据集的定性和定量实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法在解决传统手-物体交互建模问题方面表现优异，提供了更真实和语义丰富的交互结果。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D时间感知扩散模型（TADM-3D），用于准确预测MRI图像中的脑结构变化，克服了当前方法关于时间间隔关系建模和临床实用性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法的局限包括：未能捕捉结构变化与时间的关系、生成中间时间点缺乏临床意义，及无法利用完整3D解剖学上下文，而准确的脑部预测非常重要。

Method: 提出的TADM-3D模型使用预训练的脑年龄估计器（BAE）指导扩散模型生成的MRI反映时间间隔的年龄差。此外，通过“时间回溯正则”进一步提升模型的时间感知能力，训练模型从基线到随访（正向）预测，以及反向预测。

Result: TADM-3D模型在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC外部测试集上验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: TADM-3D在保持3D解剖上下文的同时，有效建模时间与脑部变化的关系，展现出良好的临床应用前景。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数，通过嵌入结构先验来增强生物医学分割任务中的连续性和完整性，无论在信号丢失区域还是下游分析中都取得了更可靠的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高生物医学分割任务中延长结构的连续性和长度的准确性，而非仅是体素级别的精确度。

Method: 提出了负中心线损失（Negative Centerline Loss）与简化拓扑损失（Simplified Topology Loss），并探索了实验设计的特性（如降尺度与间距校正），以提升分割的连续性。

Result: 在3D荧光显微镜数据集上，这些方法减少了分割实例的不连续性，尤其在输入信号缺失的区域，同时改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 结构先验嵌入到损失设计中显著提升了分割的可靠性，特别适用于生物医学领域中注重连贯性的问题。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群密度估计模型依赖于细粒度的位置信息标注，而此类标注的收集既繁琐又难以大规模应用。

Method: 提出了Count2Density管道，通过历史图像存储库生成伪密度图并用对比学习增强模型的空间感知能力，仅需计数级别的标注进行训练。

Result: 实验表明Count2Density在跨域适应和半监督设置中超越了现有最优方法，同时进一步的分析验证了其模型组件的有效性。

Conclusion: Count2Density能够从计数级标注中有效提取空间信息并实现精确的局部计数，降低了细粒度标注的繁琐性，同时提高了实际应用可能性。

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

TL;DR: 本文研究了人工智能系统在军事领域中面临的中毒攻击威胁，分析了其在军事目标检测器上的影响与检测方法，并提出了一种新的中毒检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于开源数据集和预训练模型的广泛使用，人工智能系统容易受到中毒攻击，特别是在军事领域，这种攻击可能会导致严重后果。然而，目前针对军事目标检测器中毒攻击的研究有限，因此需要深入研究该威胁及其检测方法。

Method: 创建了一个包含军事车辆的小型定制数据集MilCivVeh，并基于BadDet攻击修改实现了一种补丁式中毒攻击。此外，评估了攻击的实际影响，并测试了专门的中毒检测方法与视觉工业检测领域的异常检测方法，同时提出一种新方法AutoDetect，用于提高检测效果。

Result: 研究表明，中毒攻击尽管可以实现正向成功率，但需要大量数据被中毒才能实现，这对其实用性提出了疑问。新提出的AutoDetect方法表现出色，能够通过图片重建误差有效区分干净样本和中毒样本，同时相较现有方法更节省时间和内存。

Conclusion: 本文强调需构建大型、代表性的军事领域数据集，以进一步评估中毒攻击的风险与补丁检测的机会。新方法AutoDetect为快速、轻量级的潜在解决方案提供了良好的探索基础。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）尽管降低了辐射暴露，但其高噪声及低图像质量的问题亟待解决；传统去噪方法在图像质量保持上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于后验概率优化(PPO)强化学习的动态去噪方法，使用自定义Gym环境，实时优化去噪策略，结合编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个数据集上性能优越，包括PSNR达41.87，SSIM为0.9814，RMSE为0.00236，并在COVID-19分类任务中的精度提高了4%。

Conclusion: PPORLD-EDNetLDCT为低剂量CT成像提供了一个更安全、准确的解决方案，展现出优异的医学图像去噪潜力。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Motivation: 现有的fMRI技术在临床应用中面临信噪比低、受试者间差异大，以及现有模型频率维度考虑不足的问题，且大多数fMRI缺乏文本注释。

Method: 提出RTGMFF框架，包括ROI驱动的文本生成、多尺度频率-空间编码器和自适应语义对齐模块，以整合多模态特征并优化诊断性能。

Result: 在ADHD-200和ABIDE基准测试中，RTGMFF在诊断准确性上超过现有方法，并显著提升敏感性、特异性及ROC曲线下的面积。

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过统一文本生成和多模态特征融合，为fMRI分析提供了更强大的诊断工具，同时有效解决了模态差距问题。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

Conclusion: 本文方法实现了对3D异常的全面理解，通过引入空间及渲染异常语义的结合，PointAD+在高度多样化语义类别中的应用具有广阔前景。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

TL;DR: 探讨轻量级多模态语言模型（MLLMs）中长链式思考（CoT）数据对推理能力的增强作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究开发低于70亿参数的轻量级多模态语言模型在推理能力上的潜力。

Method: 通过长链式思考（CoT）数据的监督微调（SFT）以及后续强化学习（RL）阶段，增强模型的推理性能。

Result: 实验表明，长CoT数据的SFT阶段显著提升了MLLM的推理能力，后续的RL阶段进一步提高性能。

Conclusion: 长CoT数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLM推理能力的重要前提。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星形胶质细胞的形态复杂性及染色依赖性使得自动检测具有挑战性。

Method: 结合局部特征提取和全局上下文推理的混合CNN Transformer检测器，并引入热图引导机制和轻量级Transformer模块。

Result: 在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色数据集上表现优于主流算法，敏感度更高，误报率更低。

Conclusion: 混合CNN Transformer架构在星形胶质细胞检测中展现了强大潜力，为病理学工具的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

*Yixiong Jing,Cheng Zhang,Haibing Wu,Guangming Wang,Olaf Wysocki,Brian Sheil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出InfraDiffusion，一个零样本框架，旨在增强砖石点云的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，从而改进砖块级分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在红砖结构的低光环境下，高分辨率图像获取较难，现有点云方法的稀疏性和噪声问题限制了其对砖块缺陷的细粒度分割能力。

Method: 通过虚拟相机将砖石点云投影到深度图，并通过改进的DDNM（Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model）恢复其质量，提升图像清晰度和几何一致性。

Result: 在砖石桥和隧道点云数据集上进行实验，在使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)时显著提高了砖块级分割精度。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion框架在无需特定任务训练的情况下，提升了低光环境下点云的砖块级分割能力，为砖石结构自动化检测提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以同时刻画全局关联性和局部一致性，导致长距离互动和边界细节难以兼顾。

Method: 采用变压器捕获全局依赖性，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，同时整合多次传播订单动态学习图结构，并使用残差机制稳定训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在与现有的最先进方法对比中表现出色。

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效克服了传统方法的局限性，在高光谱解混领域具有优越性，为领域提供了可靠且先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TinyDrop的框架，可在不修改模型结构的情况下，大幅减少ViTs的计算量，同时保持分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViTs在图像分类任务中因处理全部图像tokens而导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 设计一个轻量级视觉引导模型，估算每个token的重要性，并在推理中有选择地丢弃低重要性的tokens，无需修改ViT的架构。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准上，将ViTs的FLOPs降低了多达80%，同时仅导致极小的精度下降。

Conclusion: 该框架具有很强的泛化能力和实用性，为高效的ViT分类提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估方法D-GPTScore，用于更精确地评估生成图像的自定义概念，对多个概念的评估表现尤为突出，同时引入了新的数据集CC-AlignBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标无法充分对齐人类偏好，尤其在处理多个概念的交互时缺乏细致分析。

Method: 提出D-GPTScore，通过多模态大语言模型进行分解式的细粒度评价，并创建了新的基准数据集CC-AlignBench。

Result: D-GPTScore在CC-AlignBench基准数据集上表现优异，与人类偏好的相关性显著提高。

Conclusion: 此研究为概念自定义的评估设立了新标准，并对未来研究的关键挑战提供了指导。

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark
and associated materials are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的多模态框架，通过结合CNV（拷贝数变异）、临床记录和组织病理学图像等数据，显著提升乳腺癌分型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗场景中的数据多样性较高，但不同地点和患者获取的模态数据可能存在差异。为更好实现乳腺癌分型，从多模态数据整合中获益是关键。

Method: 设计了一种松散耦合的多模态框架，能够无缝整合不同模态数据；提出了一种针对全切片图像（WSIs）的双重表示方法，并结合创新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 所提方法显著提升了乳腺癌分型的性能，相较于现有方法表现更优。在综合整合CNV、临床记录和图像数据后，取得了SOTA水准的结果。

Conclusion: 本文框架模块易于扩展，可以应用于其他类型癌症，为实现个性化治疗和提高患者预后提供新途径。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

*AJ Piergiovanni,Ganesh Satish Mallya,Dahun Kim,Anelia Angelova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，通过扩展状态空间模型（SSMs）的时间尺度，解决了密集视频字幕生成过程中长视频处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时因计算复杂性和内存限制面临困难，且传统方法需整段视频作为输入，无法实现在线处理。

Method: 提出了一种称为"带转移状态的状态空间模型"的方法，它结合了SSMs的长序列和递归特性，解决了SSMs在长时间上下文中的状态持续问题，使其能够在在线或流式模式下生成字幕。

Result: 所提方法在处理视频长度时具有良好的可扩展性，计算消耗（FLOPs）减少了7倍。

Conclusion: 新方法适用于长视频的密集字幕生成任务，尤其在在线或流媒体处理场景下更具实际价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

TL;DR: 提出一框架整合EEG、图像、文本数据以解码视觉神经表示，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从低信噪比EEG信号中解码视觉神经表示的问题。

Method: 引入文本模态以增强EEG和视觉内容语义一致性；设计适配器模块缓解高维表示的不稳定性且促进跨模态特征对齐融合；提出模态一致性动态平衡策略调整模态贡献权重；加入随机扰动正则化项提升模型泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上的Top-1和Top-5准确率分别提升了2.0%和4.7%。

Conclusion: 方法有效解码低信噪比EEG信号的视觉神经表示，增强了跨模态信息融合能力。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

### [51] [Joint Training of Image Generator and Detector for Road Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03465)
*Kuan-Chuan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为JTGD的方法，通过联合训练图像生成器和检测器实现道路缺陷检测，无需依赖集成方法或测试时数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中对计算资源有限设备的适用性不足问题，旨在使道路缺陷检测方法更加轻量化和高效。

Method: 设计了一个联合训练框架JTGD，包含具有双鉴别器的生成模型和基于CLIP的FID损失来提升合成图像质量，同时通过困难样本生成增强检测器性能。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，JTGD在无集成和数据增强条件下超越了当前最先进的方法，仅使用竞争基线模型不到20%的参数量。

Conclusion: JTGD在内存和计算资源受限条件下实现了高效且优越的道路缺陷检测，为边缘设备上的实际部署提供了可能性。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数高效的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）方法，使用像素空间中的视觉提示（visual prompts）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效的方法，用于低层次视觉任务的无参考图像质量评估，同时最大限度降低所需参数量并保持模型冻结。

Method: 利用视觉提示与图像相加，并通过mPLUG-Owl2结合文本查询“Rate the technical quality of the image”进行质量评估，仅训练了60万参数（小于基础模型的0.01%）。

Result: 在KADID-10k、KonIQ-10k和AGIQA-3k上表现优异，与全量调优方法及专用NR-IQA模型相比，达到了0.93的SRCC（KADID-10k）。

Conclusion: 首次在NR-IQA中利用像素空间视觉提示，展示了高效对多模态大模型进行低层次视觉任务适应的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level
vision tasks. The source code is publicly available at https: // github. com/

Result: OneCAT在多模态生成、编辑和理解的基准测试中，表现优于现有的开源多模态模型，并具有较高效率和先进性能。

Conclusion: OneCAT验证了纯自回归建模作为统一多模态智能的基础的可行性和优越性，为多模态模型设立了新的性能标杆。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 推出Strefer框架，为现有的Video LLMs赋予更高水平的时空指代和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video LLMs在处理依赖时间和空间指示的查询时准确性有限，难以满足动态真实场景的需求。

Method: 设计Strefer框架，该框架通过伪注释视频元数据生成多样化的指令调教数据，捕捉对象位置、动作时间线等复杂时空信息。

Result: 实验表明，基于Strefer生成数据训练的模型在时空指代任务中的表现优于基线模型，同时展现了更强的时空意识推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为具备时空感知的指令调教Video LLMs奠定了新的基础，有助于构建更强大的下一代AI伴侣。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern

effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench为文本到图像生成模型提供了一个全面、细粒度和复杂场景的评估工具，以揭示现有模型的能力瓶颈。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

TL;DR: DrDiff 是一种创新的长文本生成框架，通过动态专家调度机制、分层稀疏注意力机制和软吸收指导优化策略在效率与质量之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长文本生成中，提高生成效率的同时又要保证生成质量，往往面临权衡问题。本文旨在克服这种权衡，从而改进生成性能。

Method: 提出动态专家调度机制根据文本复杂性分配计算资源；引入分层稀疏注意力机制减少计算复杂度；设计软吸收指导优化策略结合 DPM-solver++ 提升生成速度。

Result: 在不同的长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff 展示出超越现有 SOTA 方法的性能表现。

Conclusion: DrDiff 提供了一种高效且高质量的长文本生成新路径，通过结合创新技术解决效率与质量的权衡问题，在生成速度和性能上均表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数高效微调方法SSVD，并在ESPnet框架中整合和比较了多种微调方法，对语音识别领域的模型进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适配方法虽然在语言和视觉任务中表现良好，但在语音任务中的验证有限，因此需要对这些方法进行全面分析，并探索改进的方法。

Method: 提出并综合了包括VeRA, DoRA等在内的多个微调方法，同时创新性地提出了SSVD微调方法，固定输出相关向量，选择性旋转输入相关向量，以实现高效领域适配。

Result: 在多种语音识别任务（如儿童语音和方言变化）以及模型规模（0.1B到2B）上评估了所有方法，并展示了SSVD在保持训练参数最小化的情况下具有较高适配效果。

Conclusion: SSVD方法在参数效率和适配性能上均显示优越，且所有实现均开源于ESPnet，为后续研究提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

TL;DR: 研究通过大语言模型在葡萄牙语生成的短故事中分析关于黑人和白人女性的叙事方式，揭示了潜在的殖民框架下的叙述偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型如何在生成的故事中反映女性身体的社会不平等及历史偏见形式。

Method: 从2100个文本中使用计算方法分组语义相似的故事后进行定性分析，并结合机器学习和手动话语分析。

Result: 发现三种主要表述：社会克服、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，同时揭示看似中立的文本如何再现历史不平等。

Conclusion: 研究证明了结合机器学习和手动分析能够识别隐藏于生成文本中的历史和社会偏见，为语言模型的审查提供新的方法。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IDEAlgin的范式，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）对专家开放式注释的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何评估LLMs在开放式解释性注释任务中的表现，以解决专业注释与模型生成注释之间的对齐问题。

Method: 提出并应用了IDEAlgin框架，该框架通过"挑出不合群的一个"三元组判断任务捕捉专家相似性评估，并结合多种相似性指标进行实验，包括矢量模型、嵌入以及LLM作为判定工具。

Result: 发现传统的矢量化指标难以表征专家注释的细致差异，而通过IDEAlgin提示LLMs可以大幅提高与专家评估的对齐度（提高9%-30%）。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLMs对开放性注释的能力提供了新方法，为其在教育等领域的负责任部署提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望提升阿拉伯语长文本问答生成的能力，同时开发出可自我优化的系统以增强难度和相关性。

Method: 采用由提问生成器、评估器和多个回答生成器组成的系统，通过闭环循环实现自我迭代和优化，设置可调节的质量参数控制问题难度。

Result: 发布了AraLongBench基准，并通过实验验证该系统在长文本理解上优于静态方案，显著提高了阿拉伯语LVLM模型的表现。

Conclusion: 基于完全自动化、具扩展性的设计，工作流在阿拉伯语长文本处理领域取得了显著进展，并开创了可持续优化和扩展的新范例。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

TL;DR: 研究评估了多种Transformer模型在检测在线话语中的少数群体压力表现的效果，并指出图结构和监督微调能显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少数性别与性倾向群体因少数群体压力而面临较高的健康问题和心理障碍风险。研究旨在利用机器学习方法检测在线交流中反映的少数群体压力。

Method: 对比ELECTRA、BERT等Transformer模型与传统机器学习方法及图增强方法性能。同时评估零样本与少样本学习适用性，并通过大规模Reddit数据集验证，进行多次实验确保结果稳健性。

Result: 实验表明，结合图结构的模型在性能上优于单纯Transformer模型，而监督微调方案比零样本与少样本学习效果更佳。

Conclusion: 引入社交连接和对话上下文的图增强方法，显著增强了模型对少数群体压力语言特征的捕捉能力，例如身份隐瞒、内部化污名和寻求支持。这为健康干预和公共政策制定提供了可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

TL;DR: 研究展示了通过LoRA技术适配的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）能同时执行自动发音评估（APA）和错误发音检测与诊断（MDD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了简化传统模型对APA和MDD两项任务分开训练的复杂性，并实现更整合的发音评估系统。

Method: 基于微软Phi-4-multimodal instruct模型，仅对LoRA层进行微调，使用Speechocean762数据集进行训练，无需改动模型架构或分开训练程序。

Result: 模型预测的发音评估得分与人工评分具有较高的相关性（PCC > 0.7），词错误率（WER）和音素错误率（PER）均低于0.15。

Conclusion: 通过LoRA高效适配技术，可以在无需完全微调的情况下实现性能优异的APA和MDD集成系统，同时显著简化训练过程，为英语学习者开发更高效的计算机辅助发音训练技术提供了突破性方法。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前线上社区内容审核缺乏明确的分类标准，隐含的审核标准难以被识别和分析。

Method: 通过一种可解释的架构，将审核标准表示为与内容删除相关的词汇表达计分表，并利用实验验证其与神经网络模型的效率接近，同时具有透明性。

Result: 提取的词汇模式在复制神经审核模型性能方面表现良好，并揭示了不同社区之间内容审核标准的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为隐含内容审核标准的规范化和透明化提供了新方法，有助于理解社区间内容审核的多样性及潜在模式。

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

Result: 通过该数据集对多模态模型进行基准测试，发现现有模型在理解能力上有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 数据集ProMQA-Assembly将助力程序化活动助手的发展，为多模态理解领域提供支持。

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Motivation: 心理治疗受社会污名和治疗师资源有限的限制，仅能覆盖少部分精神疾病患者，而大型语言模型（LLMs）有潜力扩展心理健康服务的可及性。

Method: 构建了一个基于CBT的长周期对话数据集，整合了多个咨询会话和认知概念化图（CCDs），用于模拟各类场景中的客户行为，并训练了深度咨询模型，构建完整的评估框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiaCBT可以有效提升LLMs模拟具备CBT专业知识的心理学家的能力。

Conclusion: DiaCBT展示出了在研发更专业的心理咨询代理方面的潜力，有望为心理健康服务提供新的支持工具。

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

Motivation: 当前自动口语评估模型在面对类别不平衡时往往导致预测偏差，影响了评估质量。

Method: 提出一种名为“Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss”的新目标，通过扰动模型预测值改进对少数类的特征表示，同时无需更改数据集。

Result: 在ICNALE基准数据集上的实验表明，BLV loss与BERT模型结合可以显著提高分类准确性和公平性。

Conclusion: 整合BLV loss后，自动口语评估模型在面对多样化学习者时更加鲁棒和公平。

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过在对比学习前增加训练阶段的新方法，提高LLM的嵌入性能，特别是对检索及重新排序任务表现显著增强，并在MTEB基准上达成了最新的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM嵌入方法将最终token（如[EOS]）用作文本嵌入，但它们未专门为捕获整体语义设计，因此在特定任务如检索和重新排序中的表现有限。

Method: 在对比学习前增加一个新训练阶段，设计基于生成的任务（EBQ2D与EBD2Q），通过结合查询及文档的相互重构来增强[EOS]嵌入的语义表达。

Result: 经实验验证，新方法在MTEB基准上超越了不同规模LLM模型的前沿性能，显著提升了检索和重新排序任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 增加的生成式训练阶段成功提升了LLM嵌入的语义质量，为文本检索及排序任务提供了更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Motivation: 为了应对当前大语言模型在多任务场景下因参数冗余、刚性结构及有限的任务适应性所带来的局限性，作者提出一种能够动态优化模型结构的调优方法。

Method: 通过引入可微分的门控函数和结构稀疏控制变量，实现任务特定子结构的动态构建，同时冻结模型主干参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个任务上优于主流参数高效调优技术，并在精度、压缩率以及对噪音和扰动的鲁棒性上实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 文中提出的基于结构搜索的多任务适配器调优方法显著提高了参数利用率和表现能力，同时验证了其在多任务自然语言理解场景中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Motivation: 通过情感分析技术帮助商业公司或电商平台识别客户对产品的反馈，从而评估营销策略。

Method: 使用改进的长期短期记忆（LSTM）模型，解决了传统RNN的梯度消失问题，并对产品评论数据集进行训练（70%）与测试（30%）。

Result: 改进的LSTM模型与传统RNN模型进行结果比较，证明前者表现更好，准确率达到91.33%。

Conclusion: 改进的LSTM模型可有效应用于商业情感分析，帮助企业根据客户评论优化产品及营销策略。

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大语言模型(LLMs)用于社会科学中的连续性标量结构测量的方法，发现不同方法的性能差异及改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何有效利用大语言模型测量语言中复杂性或情感性等连续性标量结构的问题。

Method: 评估了四种方法：直接得分法、成对比较聚合法、加权得分法以及小模型微调，并基于政治科学数据集展开实验。

Result: 直接得分法存在分布不连续的问题，而成对比较提高了得分质量；通过对得分加权改进效果更明显；最后，微调小模型即使使用较少的训练数据（如1000对），其表现也可媲美甚至超过提示法。

Conclusion: 研究为应用研究者提供了选择和优化LLMs测量连续性标量结构的方法，并发现小模型微调是十分有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的知识产权保护方法会导致LLM性能下降、高资源需求及模型修改后指纹效果不佳，研究希望找到更高效轻量的替代方案。

Method: 利用知识编辑技术首次进行指纹注入，并提出了指纹子空间感知微调（FSFT）方法来减少大规模微调造成的指纹退化。

Result: FSFT在最差情况下比普通微调效果高出10%，验证了其稳定性与优越性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了知识编辑在LLM指纹注入中的潜力，提出急需更精细的指纹注入方法，以应对现有模型区分能力的不足。

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了爱沙尼亚语词汇处理，结合词语命名任务和眼动追踪进行实验，分析多个变量对词汇处理的影响，并比较了传统预测指标与基于辨别词汇模型（DLM）的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者希望探讨新兴的辨别词汇模型（DLM）是否能有效预测词汇处理行为，并比较其与传统预测因子的表现。

Method: 使用单被试实验，结合词语命名与眼动追踪任务，分析包含首次注视时长、总注视时长、注视次数、词语命名延迟和发音时长的五个反应变量，运用了广义加性模型与DLM的线性映射及深度学习映射。

Result: 研究发现：1）DLM指标能够有效预测词汇处理；2）深度学习映射的DLM指标并未明显优于线性映射；3）经典预测因子通常更精确（除总注视时长外）；4）在命名任务中，词汇变量对首次注视时长和注视次数无预测作用。

Conclusion: DLM基于形式到意义的映射，能预测总注视时长、命名延迟及发音时长，表明语义在词语命名任务中起重要作用。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++
benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An
automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型直接用于过程数据处理的可能性，针对其生成序列的能力与流程挖掘核心任务的契合性。

Method: 采用参数高效的微调技术（parameter-efficient fine-tuning），以减少计算开销，并进行基于预测性流程监控（PPM）的实验，涵盖单任务和多任务预测。

Result: 相较于当前最优的RNN方法和基于叙述风格的解决方案，该方法在多任务场景下预测性能有所提升，并表现出更快的收敛速度和较少的超参数优化需求。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大语言模型可通过微调技术有效应用于流程挖掘任务，展现出性能和效率的优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对低资源语言僧伽罗语的第一个多项选择问答基准数据集SinhalaMMLU，并评估了26种LLMs在该任务上的表现，结果显示其在文化特定领域的表现仍需提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大型语言模型评估集中于全球或英语为中心的主题，忽视了低资源语言和文化特定内容的表现，而现有的多语言基准很多依赖于自动翻译，易引入错误及文化错位问题。

Method: 作者创建了一个包含7000多个问题的多项选择题数据集SinhalaMMLU，覆盖斯里兰卡国家课程的六个领域和30个主题，用于评估低资源语言模型的表现，同时测试了26种大型语言模型的准确率。

Result: Claude 3.5 sonnet和GPT-4o在SinhalaMMLU上的平均准确率分别为67%和62%，但总体性能仍有限，特别是在涉及文化丰富领域（如人文学科）表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型在适应低资源语言和文化特定情境方面仍需重大改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

and alignment systems, especially across multiple Latin-script languages.We
present LatPhon, a 7.5 M - parameter Transformer jointly trained on six such

outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching
language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes
on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多代理系统尽管性能优越，但复杂性导致系统容易出现错误，急需一个有效方法来进行错误归因。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架，其中使用反事实重演和编程错误注入生成TracerTraj数据集，并通过多级强化学习训练轻量化模型AgenTracer-8B。

Result: AgenTracer-8B在Who&When基准上的表现优于领先LLM，准确度提升高达18.18%。此外，它还显著提高了现有多代理系统的性能，如MetaGPT，性能提升达4.8-14.2%。

Conclusion: AgenTracer通过精确归因错误和提供可操作反馈，为多代理系统实现自我更正和进化能力，树立了新的性能标杆。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Motivation: 通过深入了解语言模型如何从数据中形成世界知识和信念表示，可以开发更加一致、鲁棒和完善的知识表征。

Method: 提出LMEnt工具套件，包括基于维基百科的注释预训练语料库、一种高效的实体检索方法、12个预训练模型，及大量中间检查点，用于分析预训练中实体提及与下游任务表现的关系。

Result: 发现事实频率对知识获取有重要作用，但仍无法完全解释学习趋势，从而展示了LMEnt的效用。

Conclusion: LMEnt能够支持对语言模型知识相关问题，如知识表征、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态的研究。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究深入揭示了NLP预训练的核心机制及其对后续任务的积极影响，显示了预训练在广泛任务中的潜力与普适性特征。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

TL;DR: 研究探索媒体报道是否能够推动AI开发者生产安全产品，以促进AI技术的广泛采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI技术开发中，开发者往往在利润和用户安全之间面临抉择。研究旨在探讨媒体报道是否能通过塑造公众认知和声誉风险，推动开发者优先考虑产品安全。

Method: 使用人工构建的自利开发者和用户的虚拟群体，通过进化博弈论的视角分析媒体报道对推动AI安全性的效果。

Result: 研究发现媒体确实在一定情况下能促进开发者与用户间的合作，但若媒体信息可靠性不足，或使用媒体的成本过高时，合作难以实现。

Conclusion: 媒体可以通过塑造公众认知和声誉机制在没有政府监管的情况下成为强大的AI安全软性监管工具，但其作用依赖于信息质量和成本。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

TL;DR: 引入了一种基于视觉和语言的世界模型（VLWM），专注于自然视频的语言理解和预测，提升了在视觉规划和预测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的高层次世界模型缺乏在语义和时间抽象上的理解和推理能力，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 论文提出VLWM，通过Tree of Captions生成观察目标，并利用LLM自我优化方法提取和预测行为与状态变化，还结合了系统1的行动解码和系统2的基于语义距离的反思性规划。

Result: VLWM在视觉规划、辅助人类决策（VPA）和对比基准测试中表现优异，提升Elo评分了27%。

Conclusion: VLWM显著提升了在复杂任务中的表现，为基于视频的语义推理任务提供了强大的模型框架。

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM技术的AI驱动分析系统无法很好地兼顾语义操作符的优化执行和Deep Research系统的灵活性，难以在大规模数据集上高效处理交互式分析任务。

Method: 提出一种原型系统，将Deep Research agent与优化的语义操作符执行结合起来，允许其生成并执行优化的语义操作符程序。

Conclusion: 该原型系统证明了结合优化语义操作符和灵活动态执行的潜力，为实现高效AI驱动分析迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Motivation: 近年来，LLMs在自然语言处理领域取得了巨大突破，而自动驾驶运动生成与之有结构上相似的问题，因此探索将LLMs模块转用于该领域具有重要意义。

Method: 论文系统地研究了5个核心LLM模块(分词器设计、位置嵌入、预训练范式、后训练策略和测试时计算)的适用性，并通过Waymo Sim Agents基准进行实验验证。

Result: 研究表明，在适当调整后，这些模块可显著提升自动驾驶运动生成的性能。此外，论文还分析了哪些技术可有效转移，失败的原因，以及特定场景下所需的调整。

Conclusion: LLMs的一些模块在经过合适调整后，可以成功用于自动驾驶运动生成，提供了关键的性能改进，也证明了模块化迁移的潜力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的迭代验证框架，用于优化具身智能的任务计划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的任务计划可能存在噪声，例如不必要的行动、冗余导航和逻辑错误，这些降低了政策质量，需要改进的方法来清理并提高行动序列的空间连贯性。

Method: 引入了一个迭代验证框架，该框架包含Judge LLM负责批判行动序列并提出修改建议，Planner LLM根据批评意见进行调整，利用自然语言提示完成不同类型错误的泛化改进。

Result: 在TEACh具身智能数据集的手动标注测试中，该框架在四种最新LLM上达到了高达90%的召回率和100%的精准率，仅需三次迭代即可完成96.5%的序列验证，同时优化了时间效率与空间组织。

Conclusion: 验证了将计划验证作为空间规划和行动精炼的可靠LLM能力，为模仿学习的高质量训练数据提供了可扩展的路径，并保留了人类错误恢复模式。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Method: 研究基于解决方案接受、LLH重复和扰动强度的三个关键原则，对低级启发算法集合进行战略性优化和转换。

Result: 所提出的转换方法，在简单的随机选择机制下，超过了当前最先进的超启发式算法，并在三个真实世界问题中找到了11个新的最佳已知解。

Conclusion: 通过战略性转换方法，既提升了现有超启发算法的性能，也简化了其设计，为跨领域超启发式研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Motivation: 解决现有符号方法无法扩展到大规模问题的局限性，同时兼顾策略的可解释性和正确性。

Result: 实现了对方法正式性质的分析，并在多个基准测试中验证了其扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法在效率和可扩展性方面明显优于现有符号方法，能够处理更大规模的规划问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂策略学习提供有效的方法，并超越现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: 本文认为医疗AI的决策责任应由多方共同承担，并强调解释性对促进参与者间沟通和信息共享的重要作用。

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在扩展其推理能力方面仍有较大改进空间，尤其是在应对复杂世界模型和提高假设生成质量时。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Motivation: 目前的AI代理大多为脚本式自动化聊天程序，受限于非可靠的指挥，存在信息泄漏问题。本研究旨在通过引入“方面”（aspects）的概念，加强AI代理对环境的感知能力，并提升其效率和安全性。

Method: 研究采用一种自下而上的方法，通过环境变化触发代理行为，引入“方面”概念，使不同代理以不同方式感知环境，进一步控制信息流动。

Result: 与普通架构相比，该框架在实验中实现了零信息泄漏，而普通架构信息泄漏率高达83%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，自适应的信息利基代理能够显著提高效率和安全性，为构建更智能的AI代理提供了新方向。这种框架对未来的AI安全与优化具有重大意义。

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

*Zhuo Cao,Yunxiao Shi,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）和运动学车道变更模型的混合架构SAM-LLM，着重于解释性和计算效率，为自主驾驶提供更优的车道变更轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统LLM缺乏物理精确性的不足，同时增强车道变更轨迹预测的解释性和计算效率。

Method: 通过微调大语言模型（LLM），使其输出增强正弦加速度模型（SAM）的核心物理参数，而非直接生成坐标，并结合参数化的方法预测具有解释性的物理轨迹。

Result: SAM-LLM实现了98.73%的顶尖意图预测准确率，同时大幅减少了80%的输出尺寸，显著提高了解释性和资源效率。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在性能、解释性和资源利用方面均优于传统方法，为自动驾驶领域提供了一种创新的轨迹建模策略。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

### [101] [StableSleep: Source-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Sleep Staging with Lightweight Safety Rails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02982)
*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于睡眠分期模型的新型流式测试时自适应方法，旨在解决模型在未知患者上的性能下降问题，并取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的睡眠分期模型往往因无法处理新患者的生理或记录条件差异而性能下降。需要一种能够自适应患者和环境变化的模型机制。

Method: 提出了一种无源流式测试时自适应（TTA）方案，结合了熵最小化方法（Tent）和批归一化统计刷新策略，辅以熵门控与EMA重置机制来控制不确定窗口和防止漂移。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，用单导联EEG数据测试表明新方法相比基线模型具有更高的表现，尤其在秒级延迟和有限内存环境中也能稳定运行。

Conclusion: 该方法不需源数据或患者校准，模型无关，适合设备侧或床旁应用，展现了良好的适用性和实用性。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

### [102] [The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)
*Zichuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加强正则化的方法，通过让神经元长期失活，介绍了一种称为生命周期原则的机制来克服相关的训练不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的诸如Dropout的方法，通过临时失活神经元来实现正则化，但存在局限性，需要探索更强的正则化形式。

Method: 提出了一种生命周期（LC）正则化方法，核心在于提供了状态记忆机制，使被恢复的神经元回到最后有效状态，而不是重新初始化其随机权重。

Result: 理论分析显示这一方法平滑了损失函数的景观，引导优化找到更平坦的极小值，从而改进泛化和鲁棒性。实验验证了其在图像分类任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 生命周期原则通过状态记忆机制有效避免了破坏性优化，改进了模型的泛化能力和抗干扰性。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

*Mazyar Taghavi,Rahman Farnoosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于期望最大化（EM）的潜变量建模方法，用于多智能体强化学习（MARL）在无人机（UAV）保护环境中的协调应用，提升了在不确定环境下的探索与协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对非法偷猎的挑战，尤其是在需要实时响应的大型部分可观测环境中，提升无人机的协调能力以更有效保护濒危野生动物。

Method: 采用一种新颖的EM-MARL框架，通过潜变量建模隐藏环境因素和多智能体之间的交互动力，并在自定义的仿真环境中对这一框架进行了实现和评估。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法（如PPO与DDPG）相比，该方法在检测准确性、适应能力以及策略收敛性方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 整合EM推理与多智能体强化学习，有望改进关键环境保护场景中的去中心化决策能力。

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

*Hunter Gittlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出通过群体感知阈值校准应对机器学习中的类别不平衡问题，证实了其优于传统的合成数据生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中因类别不平衡带来的挑战，提出比传统手段更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过为不同人口统计群体设定不同的决策阈值的校准方法，而非单一阈值或依赖合成数据的方法。

Result: 实验表明，群体感知阈值校准比SMOTE和CT-GAN等方法提升了1.5-4%的平衡准确率，同时增强了最差群体的表现。

Conclusion: 群体感知阈值校准是一种更简单、更具解释性且更有效的解决类别不平衡问题的方法，对多种模型都有适用性。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

*Cheol Woo Kim,Shresth Verma,Mauricio Tec,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了一种名为DPO-PRO的算法，用于通过大型语言模型调优设计公共健康领域资源分配问题的奖励函数，显著提高了应对偏好信号噪音的健壮性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望解决复杂的多目标问题，同时应对有限数据的限制，利用人类自然语言表达的偏好优化奖励函数。

Method: 提出了DPO-PRO算法，这是基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的轻量级分布鲁棒优化（DRO）算法，相比现有方法更不保守。

Result: DPO-PRO在母婴健康项目和标准基准测试中表现优异，在保持较低推理成本的同时提高了对偏好噪音的健壮性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO不仅在复杂目标设定中表现良好，还在多种测试集上展示了其性能，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

### [106] [Imitate Optimal Policy: Prevail and Induce Action Collapse in Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02737)
*Zhongzhu Zhou,Yibo Yang,Ziyan Chen,Fengxiang Bie,Haojun Xia,Xiaoxia Wu,Robert Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Bernard Ghanem,Shuaiwen Leon Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)，利用固定ETF结构进行动作选择层的优化，增强深度神经网络的强化学习性能。实验表明该方法在OpenAI Gym环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对传统策略梯度方法下深度神经网络表现的研究，多集中于收敛性及全局最优性，少有分析网络内部表示结构。本文发现一种类似“神经塌陷”的现象，即Action Collapse (AC)，并探讨其潜力。

Method: 作者解析并证明了在动作选择层使用固定ETF结构可以自然引导神经网络实现AC，并在策略梯度算法中应用此概念，提出基于ETF结构的ACPG方法。

Result: 实验表明，将合成的ETF作为动作选择层的配置后，ACPG能加快离散策略梯度方法的收敛速度，并显著提高强化学习任务的奖励表现。

Conclusion: ACPG方法通过构建固定的ETF目标配置，提升了深度神经网络的策略梯度计算效率，提供了有效的结构约束引导策略。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

*Saarang Panchavati,Corey Arnold,William Speier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用基于Mamba的选择性状态空间模型分析大规模EEG数据，实现了0.72的AUROC，提升了EEG在神经疾病诊断中的分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传统机器学习方法无法有效捕捉EEG复杂的时空动态特性，亟需更通用、表达力更强的模型用于复杂EEG数据分析。

Method: 采用基于Mamba的选择性状态空间模型，通过自监督的重建任务和后续的癫痫发作检测任务训练，在包含癫痫和非癫痫EEG记录的大型数据集上进行建模。

Result: 在测试集中，模型达到了0.72的AUROC，证明了其在EEG数据分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了使用大规模EEG数据训练的基础模型在临床应用中的潜力，为EEG分析和神经疾病诊断开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

### [108] [LExI: Layer-Adaptive Active Experts for Efficient MoE Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02753)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Sandeep Madireddy,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LExI是一种优化Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型的技术，通过动态调整每层活跃专家数量，提高了推理效率，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型在推理阶段效率较低，且固定的专家激活方式导致计算冗余和性能下降。需要一种更高效的推理优化方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为LExI的数据无关优化技术，根据模型权重的相对重要性，动态分配每层的活跃专家数量，从而提升推理效率。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务的最新MoE基准中，LExI显著提升了推理效率，与传统修剪方法相比，延迟降低且精度损失可忽略。例如，Qwen1.5-MoE在Nvidia H100 GPU上通过LExI实现了相同比率下10%的精度提升。

Conclusion: LExI克服了现有MoE修剪技术的局限性，动态调整每层专家数量，不仅优化了内存，还显著提高了推理效率，具有实际意义。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

*Arnab Mazumder,Javier E. Santos,Noah Hobbs,Mohamed Mehana,Daniel O'Malley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于变压器的架构——Transparent Earth，用于从多种异质数据集中重建地球地下特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理数据稀疏性、分辨率差异和多种数据类型（模态）方面存在挑战，本文旨在开发能够高效整合这些异质数据的模型。

Method: 利用变压器架构，结合基于文本嵌入的模态编码和位置编码，支持任意模态的扩展及上下文学习，从少量输入或无输入中预测结果。

Result: 验证数据表明，与现有方法相比，该模型在预测应力角度时将误差减少了超过三倍，同时通过参数扩展证明了模型的可扩展性和性能提升。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth为地球亚表层构建了一种基础模型，具有强大的预测任意地下特性能力，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

*Alejandro Rodriguez Dominguez,Muhammad Shahzad,Xia Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为结构化基函数网络的统一框架，将多假设预测和集成学习相结合，通过Bregman散度引导的质心聚合解决了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法在多假设预测的多样性和集成学习的结构化上达成统一框架，缺乏一种与损失几何一致的系统性方法。

Method: 提出了结构化基函数网络，通过Bregman散度的质心聚合连接多假设预测和集成学习，并提出一个可调节的多样性机制，提供偏差-方差-多样性权衡的参数控制。

Result: 通过实验验证了该方法的有效性，并使用该机制研究在预测复杂度、容量和多样性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了多假设预测和集成学习，提高了预测的不确定性计算的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过预训练图神经网络（GNNs）来归纳学习拉普拉斯特征向量的新方法，解决传统MPNNs因过平滑导致无法捕捉全局和区域图结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MPNNs在网络深度增加时，因过平滑难以捕获全局和区域图结构。低频拉普拉斯特征向量能编码全局信息，预训练GNNs预测这些特征向量可引导网络天然学习每个图的大规模结构模式。

Method: 提出一个自监督预训练框架，基于结构学习，通过预测图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量来让GNNs学习全局和区域信息。该框架适用于所有图数据集，即便在任务相关数据稀少时可使用合成特征。

Result: 通过实验证明采用该框架预训练的模型在多种基于图结构的任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架相比领域特定的预训练方法，更具灵活性，适合广泛的图数据集预训练需求。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在研究和验证视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决是否为功能上独立的机制，以及如何通过分解改进模型的可解释性与鲁棒性。

Method: 通过对LLaVA-OV-7B模型的中间层和注意力模式进行研究，设计监督线性探针和基于组的注意力分析方法，分析冲突信号的出现和模式分化。

Result: 发现模型中产生线性可解码的冲突信号，并且冲突检测和冲突解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段表现出分化。

Conclusion: 冲突检测和冲突解决是模型中功能上独立的机制，这种分解可以促进更好的模型解释性和针对性干预以增强多模态情景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs的安全性，通过删除预训练过程中获得的私密或有害数据。

Method: 引入Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，在遗忘与保留集间实现更稳定的动态；提出用于评估的LKF数据集，并改进评估框架，包括利用LLM作为语义判断工具及使用最差情况评估。

Result: JensUn相比其他方法在遗忘-效用权衡上表现更好，并对良性再学习产生较强抵抗力。新的评估框架显示现有方法效果相较预期差。

Conclusion: JensUn在遗忘任务中效果优越，并通过改进的框架展现了现有方法的不足，为LLMs的安全性提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理具有变点的时间序列数据时表现不足，需要一种新方法来有效应对不确定性问题。

Result: 通过6种合成和真实数据集验证，CPTC在有效性和适应性上优于现有先进基线。

Conclusion: CPTC在时间序列中提供了更好的有效性和适应性，并通过理论证明和实验证实了其实用性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有PDE模型在自回归推断和分布之外情境中表现不佳，以及计算和数据要求高的问题，提出了一种新方法。

Method: 引入了测试时计算（TTC）策略，结合两种奖励模型评估基于随机的模型预测的时空一致性。

Conclusion: 该TTC框架为开发更先进的推理算法和PDE建模奠定了基础，有潜力改变物理和工程中的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Result: 实验表明该框架在Grid2Op仿真环境中表现优越，显著优于领域内常规基线，并展现出更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部观察空间和动作空间分解，实现了动态实时网格管理，为电网控制提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Result: SBICE生成更现实的合成数据集，从而提高因果估计器评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: SBICE在不确定性条件下提供一种健壮的数据一致性方法，用于因果基准测试。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Method: 提出了Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW)事件检测技术，并与STA/LTA方法进行了比较，使用支持向量机（SVM）结合径向基（RBF）核进行分类，同时运用可解释AI进行特征影响分析。

Result: 在控制环境中检测范围达155.6米，自然环境中达140米；分类准确率分别为控制环境99%、自然环境73%和HEC冲突区域70%。

Conclusion: 建议的新框架在资源受限条件下表现出色，为实时大象探测提供了可行的解决方案，同时揭示了影响分类性能的关键特征。

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Motivation: 现如今DFU治疗中关于减轻足底压力的处方制定依然缺乏统一的标准和特性选择，并且个性化和评价实践上存在局限性，因此需要一种科学系统的方法来提升效果。

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL是一种有效且简单的后处理框架，能够在不显著影响预测精度的情况下对不确定性进行量化。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Motivation: 现有方法在技能多样性学习的可扩展性及评估上存在挑战，多样性定义可能导致结果不可比，亟需新框架来量化及优化多样性。

Result: Vendi Score有效支持技能评估，VendiRL框架可在新的复杂环境下优化不同形式的技能多样性。

Conclusion: VendiRL框架能在不同下游任务设置中促进技能生成的多样性学习，为未来应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Motivation: 传统神经网络在处理组合信号及近似周期函数预测上表现不足，需设计结合频谱分析和记忆功能的方法来克服局限性。

Method: 提出结合自回归模型（AR）与Kolmogorov-Arnold Network（KAN）的混合模型，利用内嵌AR捕捉动态记忆，KAN处理非线性静态部分。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR-KAN在72%的真实数据集中表现优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 借助AR-KAN，可以实现近似周期信号更高效的处理和预测，填补了现有神经网络在此类问题上的空白。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前联邦学习方法在部分参与情况下因可能存在拜占庭客户端而导致训练失败的问题。

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原理，即服务器不仅聚合活动客户端的动量，还使用非活动客户端最近接收到的梯度，这被集成在D-Byz-SGDM优化器中。

Result: 理论分析证明了该方法在部分参与环境中的收敛性并且实验验证了模型在不同拜占庭攻击情况下都能实现稳定鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM能够在维持隐私的同时，使联邦学习在挑战性的部分参与和拜占庭攻击下实现鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Motivation: 解决Muon优化器中学习率难以选择的问题，同时结合AdaGrad的优势进行自适应优化。

Method: 设计AdaGO，通过一种基于梯度累计的自适应步长与正交更新方向相结合，同时保留更新方向的正交性并调整步长，使其适应优化景观。

Result: 在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归实验中，AdaGO优于Muon和Adam优化器。

Conclusion: AdaGO实现了理论上最佳的收敛性，同时在实际应用中表现出色，具有较高的计算和内存效率。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过融合高成本的X射线数据与低成本的吸收率数据，提出了一种多模态数据融合方法，用于提高激光粉末床熔融(LPBF)工艺中熔池动态预测的精准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传感器技术在实时监测增材制造过程中提供的数据并不总是切实可靠，尤其高成本X射线尽管提供了高空间信息，但实际工业环境中不实用，而廉价的光电二极管吸收率数据虽成本低，但噪声大，单独使用预测准确度低。

Method: 融合卷积神经网络（CNNs）以分析X射线数据空间特征与循环神经网络（RNNs）以提取吸收率信号时间特征，通过早期融合策略构建多模态学习框架。此外，利用多模态模型作为迁移学习模型，优化仅基于吸收率的RNN模型。

Result: 多模态数据训练显著提高预测精度，相较单一数据更为准确。而经过训练后模型仅需吸收率数据即可推断熔池动态，省去了X射线成像需求。

Conclusion: 该多模态融合方法实现了成本低廉的实时监测，并具有广泛的增材制造应用潜力。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种优化二值量化方法，以大幅缩减存储及推理开销，同时保持高质量模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二值量化方法因压缩过度导致性能明显下降的问题，同时寻求接近4位量化方法的性能水平。

Method: 提出了针对二值量化的全新优化目标及三种算法，通过自适应分组策略动态选择最佳非结构化子矩阵，结合分块量化方法提升效率与性能。

Result: 实验结果显示平均位长仅1.007，且模型性能接近原始模型。量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型困惑度为8.23，相较原始模型7.81基本持平，并优于现有二值量化SOTA方法。此外，与4位量化SOTA方法GPTQ相比表现和效率具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提方法在二值量化中实现了高效性能和显著的压缩效果，为大模型量化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过建立一个基于离散几何结构的框架，深入分析ReLU网络的功能行为。

Method: 将每个线性激活区域作为节点，利用激活翻转形成的连接边构建图论模型，同时通过理论推导和实验验证展开分析。

Result: 证明随机初始化的RTGs具有强扩展性、二项分布特性和广义化影响的谱特性；提出了新的容量和广义化界限；验证了光谱间隙与广义化的相关性等结论。

Conclusion: 研究展示了一种统一的框架，通过离散功能几何的视角，为分析、诊断和改进ReLU网络的广义化能力提供了新方法。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Motivation: 解决SAM优化器在分布式大批量训练中的低效率问题，同时保留其泛化优势。

Method: 通过加入异步分布式采样策略，设计了一种平滑的尖锐度感知损失地形以优化，并消除同步瓶颈。

Result: LSAM提高了大批量训练的收敛速度，且最终准确率超过数据并行的SAM方法。

Conclusion: LSAM在效率和泛化性能上实现了良好的平衡，是对大批量训练的优化改进。

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的DRL交通信号控制方式因其选择策略会造成信号周期不公平分配或驾驶员难以预期的安全隐患问题。目标是设计一种既公平又高效的信号周期分配方法。

Method: 提出了一种分层的周期时间分配方法，高层代理负责在NS和EW方向之间分配周期时间，低层代理再在直行和左转之间进一步分配时间，实现灵活分配。

Result: 在真实和合成的道路网络以及交通流数据上测试时，DHCP模型在所有数据集上都超越了对比方法，表现最佳。

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层时间分配方式，成功提高了交通信号控制的公平性和效率，适用于多样化的交通场景。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Motivation: 解决当前TDCR技术在多放射性核素分析中的自动化程度低和对混合特异性标准依赖性高的问题。

Method: 采用Geant4模拟生成训练数据，设计定制的神经网络架构，通过深度学习实现对多核素活度比例、检测效率和光谱重构的高精度预测。

Result: 模型在多项任务上显示出高精度（活度比例平均绝对误差0.009，检测效率平均绝对误差0.002，光谱重构结构相似性指数0.9998）。

Conclusion: 该方法具有自动化、多核素分析、实时处理和无标准需求的显著潜力，特别适用于不能提供参考材料或需要快速分析的场景。

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Motivation: 探索在自动驾驶中模型解释是否具有一致性，以及不同模型类是否会导致解释分歧，从而验证XAI的可靠性。

Method: 使用Qualitative Explainable Graphs(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类模型（可解释性梯度提升模型和复杂的图神经网络），利用特征归因方法分析解释一致性。

Result: 研究发现解释分歧显著，表明解释歧义是问题本身的固有性质而非模型的局限。

Conclusion: 作者认为在XAI中，尤其是安全关键领域，理解和管理解释歧义是至关重要的。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种无阈值框架，用于解决神经网络解释方法评价中阈值选择偏差的问题，通过一个新的AUC-IoU指标对其进行了全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络归因方法评价受到单一阈值选择偏差的影响，可能导致结果逆转和错误结论，因此需要一种更鲁棒的评价框架。

Method: 提出了一种无阈值的归因方法评价框架，通过计算“交并比面积下的曲线”（AUC-IoU），实现对整个阈值范围内归因质量的评估。

Result: 在皮肤病学影像评估中，所提出的无阈值方法展示了更可靠的区分性能，例如XRAI与其他方法相比提升显著，且通过对不同病变规模的分层分析验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了归因行为的理论见解与实践指导，成为构建医学影像等领域内鲁棒比较标准的重要工具。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Result: 新提出的设计选项在多个数据集上进行了评估，深入探讨了其性能和实用性。

Conclusion: 新方法有效扩展了决策树学习算法的设计空间，为平衡性能与公平性提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Conclusion: 集成对比学习的改进方法不仅克服了GCSL当前的问题，还显著提高了算法性能，证明了其在多样环境中的优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Harald Vilhelm Skat-Rørdam,Sneha Das,Kathrine Sofie Rasmussen,Nicole Nadine Lønfeldt,Line Clemmensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于窗口的F1指标（F1$_w$），用以评估时间序列中的事件检测表现，该指标在三个生理数据集的实验中表现出比传统指标更能反映模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的事件检测评估指标如F1和F1$_{pa}$在处理真实世界的不平衡数据集时常常难以准确反映模型性能，尤其是在现象逐渐变化且具有时间扩散性的情况下。

Method: 通过设计一个窗口化的F1指标（F1$_w$），该指标引入时间容忍度，针对时间扩散性现象进行更鲁棒的性能评估，窗口大小可以根据领域知识进行调整。

Result: 通过对三个生理数据集的实证分析（包括两个野外数据集和一个实验数据集），F1$_w$指标揭示了传统指标无法识别的模型性能模式，并在野外数据应用中体现了统计显著的结果。

Conclusion: F1$_w$指标弥补了时间序列评估中的关键缺陷，并为精度需求随情境变化的医疗应用提供了实际指导。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TopoMap的新方法，用于生成输入特征空间的拓扑图，以便更有效地测试深度学习模型的失效模式特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在深度学习测试中常规性引入扰动，但可能忽略输入特征空间中其他潜在失效特征区域。缺乏对这些失效特征的系统分组。

Method: TopoMap方法主要通过降维获得输入嵌入，并应用聚类技术对输入特征进行分组。评估过程中利用深度神经网络 (DNN) 模拟人类评估输入群组的区分性，以选择最佳的特征拓扑图。

Result: TopoMap生成的特征拓扑图分布区分显著且具有意义。通过突变分析验证了该图可有效选择杀伤性输入。实验结果表明，与随机选择相比，TopoMap在平均上提升了35%（杀伤突变体）和61%（非杀伤突变体）。

Conclusion: TopoMap是一种可靠的方法，能优化输入特征空间的分组并提升深度学习模型的测试效率，尤其在突变检测方面取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Motivation: 在多目标优化中，评估代价极高，现有方法或需要从头训练高斯过程模型，或依赖以往实验进行深度学习预训练，缺乏通用性和灵活应对能力。

Method: 提出FoMEMO范式，通过在广泛多样的合成数据集上预训练基础模型，在给定领域轨迹和用户偏好的条件下进行快速优化，无需额外模型训练。

Conclusion: FoMEMO通过预训练基础模型提供了无需额外训练的创新思路，在昂贵的多目标优化问题中表现出色，是一种高效适应性的解决方案。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Result: 实现了在多个多样化表示系统之间的通用转换，同时能够维持语义一致性及信息保留。

Conclusion: 结构转移是一种系统无关的通用方法，可广泛应用于各种实际场景中选择和优化表示。

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

Motivation: 现有方法多为事后检测模型，难以在金融安全风险中提供预防性的价值。

Method: HyPV-LEAD利用窗口-地平线建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，实现区块链网络中异常交易的早期预警检测。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实验表明，该方法的PR-AUC达到0.9624，并在精度和召回率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HyPV-LEAD通过引入早期预警机制和创新方法，为动态区块链环境中的实时风险管理和AML合规提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Conclusion: EvolveSignal展现了AI辅助算法设计在交通工程中的潜力，为交通信号控制研究开辟了新方向，同时为工程师提供了实际改进的洞察。

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Conclusion: GANs在隐私保护模型设计中显示出显著的优势，其在抵抗隐私泄露方面优于扩散模型，这为未来设计更安全的生成模型提供了参考方向。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Method: 提出Fair-Synergy框架，利用智能体准确性与系统资源的凹关系，确保资源在多智能体之间公平分配，并扩展资源分配到多维机器学习效用领域，包括模型参数、训练数据量及任务复杂性。

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional

landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing

Method: 对61个国家的睡眠数据进行统计分析，并基于是否实施夏令时进行分组比较，同时结合纬度因素，分析不同地区的睡眠模式差异。

Result: 实施夏令时的国家平均睡眠时长更长，但在低纬地区，实施夏令时的国家睡眠时间较短，而在高纬地区则相反。

Conclusion: 夏令时对睡眠的影响因地理位置而异，尤其受到纬度的调节作用。

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

*Paul-Gauthier Noé,Andreas Nautsch,Driss Matrouf,Pierre-Michel Bousquet,Jean-François Bonastre*

TL;DR: 研究了似然函数的校准问题，并将其从二分类扩展到多分类问题，提出了等距对数比变换的概念并探讨其性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多关于校准的研究集中于概率预测，但似然函数的校准在多类问题中的研究较少。

Conclusion: 多分类中的似然函数校准方法提升了方法的可解释性和可靠性，展现了其在机器学习中的潜力。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

### [158] [Robult: Leveraging Redundancy and Modality Specific Features for Robust Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03477)
*Duy A. Nguyen,Abhi Kamboj,Minh N. Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult 是一个旨在应对多模态学习中缺失模态和有限标注数据问题的可扩展框架，采用信息论方法和模态保留机制，提升任务性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中缺失模态和有限标注数据的关键挑战。

Method: 1. 使用软正样本-无标签对比损失（PU loss）优化任务相关特征对齐，同时高效利用有限标注数据；2. 通过潜在重建损失确保模态特定信息的保留；框架具有模块化设计。

Result: 实验结果表明，Robult 在各种数据集上优于现有方法，尤其是在半监督学习和模态缺失情况下表现出色。

Conclusion: Robult 提升了多模态学习的性能和鲁棒性，同时具有轻量化设计，便于扩展并可与现有架构无缝集成，适用于真实世界应用。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种处理高维数据的方法，通过在降维前进行聚类，然后嵌入每个聚类并对齐，保留全局结构的同时提高透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析现有t-SNE和UMAP在降维中对全局几何结构失真的问题，提出改进方法以更好平衡局部信息保留和全局结构呈现，同时提高结果可解释性。

Method: 该方法分三步：1）先对数据进行聚类分类；2）将每个类别单独进行嵌入；3）再对齐所有类别以获得整体嵌入。

Result: 通过多种合成和真实数据集的实验，验证了该方法在透明性和性能方面与现有方法相比有竞争力。

Conclusion: 新方法在保留全局几何结构的同时提高了可解释性，是对现有降维方法的有益补充。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Motivation: 在脓毒症治疗中，确定每位患者所需的静脉输液和升压药剂量具有挑战性，而医疗数据的复杂性提供了通过图表示改进现有自动化方法的可能性。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III数据集，将患者数据建模为时间演化的异构图，采用GraphSAGE和GATv2图神经网络架构进行表征学习，并与dBCQ算法相结合进行策略学习。

Result: 实验评估结果证实了基于图的方法的潜力，同时揭示了表征学习中存在的复杂性。

Conclusion: 基于图的表征学习和策略学习方法在脓毒症治疗中表现出前景，但需要解决其领域特有的复杂性问题。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF)的新方法，旨在解决强化学习中的奖励模型缺陷问题，提升推理任务的质量。方法通过整合过程奖励与结果奖励的优势，改进了推理准确性和中间步骤质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习奖励模型存在粒度问题：结果奖励模型无法辨别正确答案中的错误推理，以及错误答案中的正确推理；而过程奖励模型虽然细致，却存在不准确和奖励作弊问题，限制了推理质量的进一步提升。

Method: 提出了PROF方法，其通过一致性驱动的样本选择，将过程奖励和结果奖励的优点结合起来，优化正确回答和错误回答的训练样本平衡。

Result: 实验表明，PROF方法在最终推理准确性方面相比传统混合方法提高了超过4%，并提升了中间推理步骤的质量。

Conclusion: PROF方法通过数据处理优化平衡了细粒度的过程奖励和粗粒度的结果奖励，为数学推理任务中的强化学习模型提供了一种更加有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

TL;DR: 本文研究了用于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 的初始化策略，提出了两种理论驱动的方法以及一种基于经验的幂律初始化方式，通过实验验证了这些方法在不同条件下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 的研究集中在其应用性和灵活性，但其初始化方法尚未深入探索，研究者希望通过改进初始化策略来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化策略（受LeCun和Glorot启发）和一个可调指数的经验幂律初始化方法，并通过函数拟合、PDE（偏微分方程）基准测试和Feynman数据评估等多角度进行实验分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，Glorot启发的初始化方法在参数丰富的模型中表现优异，而幂律初始化在不同任务和架构规模下整体表现最好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同的初始化策略对KANs的表现有显著影响，新提出的方法在性能和普适性方面具有明显优势。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

*Phuc Pham,Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了LINKER，一个无须3D结构输入的序列模型，用于预测蛋白质残基与配体功能基团的相互作用类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质-配体解释性模型大多依赖三维结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了其适用性和生物学相关性。

Method: 开发了LINKER，通过序列输入和结构监督的注意机制，利用功能基团为基础的图案提取方法，预测蛋白质与配体功能基团之间的相互作用类型。

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准上的实验表明，该方法能够产生符合真实生化注释的预测结果，并证明了功能组抽象与结构监督的重要性。

Conclusion: LINKER在仅需序列级输入的情况下，可用于大规模无结构数据场景，展现了其在药物设计中的潜在应用。

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的数据驱动方法在学习液体行为时，常局限于静态自由落体或简单操作环境，忽略了复杂的动态刚体交互。

Conclusion: 提出的模型具备良好的泛化性和实用性，可为复杂液体和刚体交互任务提供高保真模拟和解决方案。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究DP-SGD（差分隐私随机梯度下降）在量化过程中的性能退化问题，并提出QPQuant动态量化框架以缓解该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现有DP-SGD结合低精度量化时出现模型准确性严重下降的问题，并探索解决方法。

Method: 提出QPQuant框架，通过动态层选择进行量化，包括概率抽样选择每轮量化的层，并采用差分隐私损失敏感性估计器优先化量化对模型性能影响较小的层。

Result: 实验表明，QPQuant在多个模型和数据集上优于静态量化基线模型，在低精度硬件上实现高达2.21倍的理论吞吐量提升，同时验证准确率下降低于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant通过动态与敏感性意识的量化方法，显著缓解了DP-SGD导致的量化性能下降问题，并保持了隐私保护，同时提高了硬件效率。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经ODEs在顺序训练过程中的遗忘问题，确保新样本的训练不会影响已训练样本的输出映射。

Method: 通过定义控制函数参数子空间，并证明它是有限余维的Banach子流形，采用沿这一子流形切空间的控制函数变形/延续进行顺序训练。

Result: 证明了TwF中使用的参数子空间性质，为其保留映射特性的能力从一阶近似提升至完全理论基础。

Conclusion: TwF方法可以在神经ODE顺序训练中有效防止遗忘问题，其核心是在严格数学基础上控制参数子空间，确保训练样本间的映射保持不变。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要由于大语言模型的极大响应空间和最优输出的稀疏性。

Conclusion: AEnt能够有效弥补传统熵正则化在LLM-RL训练中的不足，显著提升大规模强化学习任务的性能。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 在联邦学习中，部分边缘设备由于内存和通信限制无法参与训练，这会导致数据不可访问以及系统性偏差问题。

Method: 设计ZOWarmUp，以零阶优化为基础，通过随机初始化和减少方差技术，让低资源设备可以参与模型训练，同时减少通信成本。

Result: 通过在不同数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，ZOWarmUp算法在多种情况中具有鲁棒性，可以有效提升训练结果。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp让更多低资源设备参与联邦学习，获取更多样化的数据，从而改善训练效果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and
energy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic
advantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized
owing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms
inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with
noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance
from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically
plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this
insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in
which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling
selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability
compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting
as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior
performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and
temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting
excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically
plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation,
providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical
validations. This work thus paves the way for more resilient, efficient, and
biologically inspired spiking neural networks.

Conclusion: NFTM架构提供了一种可微分的统一计算基质，将离散计算与连续场动态有效结合起来。

Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable
architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and
perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural
controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform
local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes
updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions.
This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods
while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three
example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110),
physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement
(CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that
compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and
generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational
substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a
single differentiable framework.
