Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了用于全景X光片牙齿状况分类的深度学习方法，混合模型（如CNN与随机森林结合）显示最佳性能（85.4%的准确率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索将深度学习应用于牙科放射图像分析，以实现自动化诊断并提高诊断效率。

Method: 使用包含1,512张全景X光片数据集（包括填充物、蛀牙、植牙、阻生齿的专家标注），对自定义CNN、混合模型及预训练模型进行实验测试并比较效果。

Result: 混合模型（CNN+随机森林）表现最佳，以85.4%的准确率超越74.3%的CNN基准模型。最优预训练模型VGG16达到82.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 混合模型可更好地区分形态上相近的牙齿状况，结合CNN特征提取和集成分类器是一条实用的自动化牙科诊断路径。然而，需要更大量数据及进一步的临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出Q-Align框架，通过改善对齐方式解决注意力泄露问题，提升图像外观迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在零样本外观迁移中出现的注意力泄露问题，优化语义对齐以改善迁移性能。

Method: 提出Q-Align框架，核心包括：1. 查询间对齐以优化语义映射；2. 键值重排以增强特征对应；3. 改进注意力机制以保持语义一致性。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观真实度上优于现有方法，同时能很好地保留结构信息。

Conclusion: Q-Align框架有效解决了零样本外观迁移中的语义对齐问题，具有优异效果。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ERTACache的缓存框架，通过解决特征漂移误差和步长放大误差，实现了扩散模型中高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的逐步推理过程导致了计算效率低下问题，需要提高采样效率，同时确保生成质量不下降。

Method: 本文引入ERTACache，通过离线残差分析选择可重用步骤，动态调整积分间隔，并通过闭式形式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差，全方位优化缓存性能。

Result: 实验显示，ERTACache在图像和视频生成基准上达到了最高2倍的推理加速，同时保持甚至提升了视觉质量。在Wan2.1扩散模型上实现了2倍加速，并且生成质量几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: ERTACache提供了一种高效且可靠的缓存策略，大幅提升了扩散模型的采样效率，是解决该类问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向视频问答与指令微调的新任务：Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)，以改进视频-语言理解的细粒度时间语义捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频大模型由于稀疏帧采样和不足的帧间推理监督，难以捕捉视频的细粒度时序语义，而人类能通过拖动进度条自发筛选关键时间段，研究旨在模仿这一能力。

Method: 设计了TVS作为前端处理任务，保留关键视频片段并同步重构问题，不破坏答案一致性，并保持答案不变性与一致性。可与视频指令微调与视频问答推理无缝集成。

Result: 提出了TVS首个基准测试，并提出新基线ReSimplifyIt，F-1分数比相似任务提升了0.47，在实验中实现训练阶段提升7.33%，推理阶段提升34.6%。

Conclusion: TVS有效优化了时间信息筛选，显著改善了视频语言理解中的训练与推理性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种改进外科手术工具定位方法，通过将工具骨架姿态注解作为替代，解决了传统深度学习工具分割方法因多样化数据不足而导致性能受限的问题，并发布了相关数据集和基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在外科手术工具定位中表现受限的主要原因是缺乏多样并准确标注的数据集，因此需要引入一个更高效的注解方法来优化数据集的使用效率。

Method: 提出通过工具骨架姿态注解这一新颖的标注方式，结合开发ROBUST-MIPS数据集，从现有的ROBUST-MIS数据集衍生而来，以便研究和比较姿态及分割注解方法。此外，设计了基准测试框架，并提供开源软件以支持社区使用。

Result: 基于提出的方法，通过流行的姿态估计技术进行外科工具定位实验，展示了骨架姿态注解的高效性，并提供了高质量的实验结果作为依据。

Conclusion: 实验和数据的发布成功证实了骨架姿态注解可以作为外科工具定位的有效替代解决方案，为未来研究提供了更简便且可扩展的数据注解方式。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为Safe-Control的插件式安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中不安全内容的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型尽管表现强大，但易被滥用或误用，现有安全机制在分布变化中容易失效或需要大量模型调整，因此需要新方法。

Method: Safe-Control是一种基于数据驱动和安全条件的插件式安全机制，通过加入控制信号进行安全补丁更新，且支持在多种模型间灵活使用和组合。

Result: Safe-Control在六种不同的文本到图像生成模型中显著减少了不安全内容生成，相比七种现有方法提高了性能，将不安全内容生成概率降至7%以下。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效的、安全可控的插件式解决方案，可以在保持图像质量和文本对齐度的同时减少不安全内容生成，并在各种生成模型中表现优越。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV系统处理从自然语言指令和车载摄像头图像中定位目标区域，提出解决基于目标存在预测和分割问题的方法，在新建基准GRiN-Drive上的性能表现优异，并在现实环境中验证其鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前方法在处理边界模糊的stuff类目标区域和存在多个目标或无目标时表现欠佳，需开发一种更有效的定位和分割方案。

Method: GENNAV同时预测目标存在与分割mask，提出GRiN-Drive新基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标样本，进行了标准指标评估和现实环境中的实验验证。

Result: 在GRiN-Drive数据集上，GENNAV超越基线方法，并在四辆汽车中对五个不同城市区域进行零样本转移性能实验中通过展现其鲁棒性优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GENNAV通过创新目标预测与分割方法，解决了现有方法在stuff类目标区域难题，在多种环境下验证其卓越性，提高了目标区域识别技术的实用性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种自适应多模态大语言模型R-4B，通过判断任务的复杂程度，选择性应用复杂推理过程，提高效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但在简单任务中思考过程显得冗余，因此需要改进模型以提升简单任务的效率。

Method: 提出R-4B模型，通过双模式退火和双模式策略优化技术，结合复杂推理和无需推理的能力，并利用改良的GRPO框架进行二阶段训练，提升模型在思考模式选择上的准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，R-4B在25个挑战性基准数据集上达到了最新的性能，与更大的模型在复杂推理任务上表现相当，同时减少了计算成本。

Conclusion: R-4B能够自适应选择性应用思考过程，在各种复杂度的任务中实现高效且准确的性能表现，展示了在多模态推理领域的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文以Mamba融合机制为核心，提出HiddenObject框架，通过融合RGB、热成像和深度数据，实现对隐藏或伪装目标的更佳检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，基于RGB的方法在遮挡、伪装和光线变化等情况下表现较差，因此需要更加健壮的、模态不可知的检测方法。

Method: 采用Mamba机制，将RGB、热成像和深度数据中模态特定特征进行提取和融合，形成统一表示以应对多种挑战场景。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证HiddenObject的性能，展示了其对比现有方法的SOTA或竞争性表现，并揭示单模态和简单融合策略的局限性。

Conclusion: Mamba融合架构在视觉退化或复杂条件下显著提升了多模态目标检测的能力，具有很高的推广潜力。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像引导导航中CT/X-ray配准由于对高精度和实时表现的高要求，一直充满挑战。

Method: 本文提出了RadGS-Reg框架，包括基于学习的放射性高斯(RadGS)重构模块，并引入反事实注意学习(CAL)机制，以及患者特定的预训练策略，从模拟数据到真实数据逐步过渡并学习形状先验。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在重建与配准任务上均优于现有方法，达到最新性能水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的RadGS-Reg框架有效解决了高噪声X-ray图像下的骨椎CT/X-ray配准问题，其表现优于现有方法，并展示了良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于公共领域中缺乏大规模标注数据集，自动生成精确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型存在重大挑战。

Method: 引入了SYNBUILD-3D，一个多模态合成数据集，包括语义增强的3D框架图、平面图和屋顶点云。结合三种模态信息来实现语义一致的建筑模型生成。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D可以帮助未来研究实现基于预定义布局和几何约束的LoD 4三维建筑自动生成，为建筑设计和导航等领域提供重要支持。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at
https://github.com/kdmayer/SYNBUILD-3D.

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Method: 利用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，并通过注意力机制融合构建统一的全球概念激活向量（GCAV），解决了现有方法的跨层一致性问题。

Result: GCAV方法显著减少了TCAV分数的方差，同时增强了概念定位能力，并提升了对对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV方法通过整合跨层信息，实现了深度学习模型对人类定义概念的更全面和可解释的理解。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前对象重识别(ReID)方法依赖于特定领域的模型，不具备对新类别的泛化能力，VICP框架通过视觉和语言模型的协作，直接实现了对新类别的泛化而无需参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID方法对新类别的泛化能力较弱且需求高成本的标注数据，亟需一种更具有适应性且减少标注需求的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为VICP的框架，结合了语言大模型(LLMs)和视觉基础模型(VFM)，通过动态视觉提示和语义推理，使模型无需重新训练即可泛化到新类别。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准上，VICP在未见类别任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将语义概念与视觉模型的先验对齐，实现了无需数据集特定微调的新类别泛化，有效降低了成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于SegResNet的Auto3DSeg架构在MRI图像上分割胰腺肿瘤的表现，通过任务1（T1加权MRI）和任务2（T2加权MRI）探索自动分割的可能性，结果显示性能有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确分割胰腺肿瘤对于诊断、治疗规划和结果评估至关重要。然而，由于解剖变异性和数据有限，自动分割面临巨大挑战。

Method: 研究采用Auto3DSeg中的SegResNet模型，对两种MRI任务数据（任务1：T1加权动脉对比MRI；任务2：T2加权MR-Linac）进行训练和评估，使用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成评估性能。

Result: 任务1的分割性能（DSC=0.56，HD95=41.1 mm）；任务2的分割性能较差（DSC=0.33，HD95=20.1 mm），表明数据序列和数据集规模的差异对模型表现具有显著影响。

Conclusion: 尽管分割性能一般，但结果展现了自动化分割的潜力，并强调需要更大、更标准化的MRI数据集以提升模型的鲁棒性及其临床效用。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Reverse Imaging的新方法，旨在通过物理驱动的数据增强和领域适配来解决心脏磁共振(MRI)图像分割在不同成像序列之间泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同成像序列间图像对比度的显著变化，现有的预训练心脏MRI分割模型难以泛化。本文旨在利用所有MRI图像的共同物理特性(例如质子密度、T1和T2值)，从根本上解决这一问题。

Method: 提出的Reverse Imaging方法基于物理原理，反向推断心脏MRI图像的底层自旋特性，并通过学习生成扩散模型从先验分布中推断参数，从而实现图像增强与领域适配。

Result: 实验表明，Reverse Imaging可以在显著不同的图像对比度和成像协议下实现高度准确的心脏MRI分割，表明其具有出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging方法通过推导自旋特性提供了一种解释性强的潜变量，用于灵活生成新序列，从而实现MRI图像分割的广谱泛化。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PHD的新方法，用于从视频中恢复个性化的3D人体网格，重点提升根据用户特定形状信息的姿态估计精度，并以模块化方式提升现有3D姿态估计器的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的HMR方法未能充分结合个性化人体形状和3D姿态的合理性，对3D精度造成限制，因此需要解决此不足以提升性能。

Method: 提出一种新的管道，首先校准用户的体型，然后根据该个性化体型进行姿态拟合。采用了基于形状的3D姿态先验模型，通过Point Diffusion Transformer引导拟合，结合Point Distillation Sampling损失优化。

Result: 改进了姿态的骨盆校正精度和绝对姿态精度，同时仅需合成数据进行训练，具备高度数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了现有HMR的精度，还能作为模块化插件无缝集成到其他3D姿态估计器中，显示了其灵活性和优越性。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计算法（HTP），通过多层次动态剪枝策略显著降低计算成本并提升推理速度，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的3D姿态估计方法计算成本较高，为解决这一问题，作者开发了HTP框架，以动态剪枝方式优化计算效率。

Method: HTP框架通过分阶段的层次化动态剪枝策略优化计算，包括：(1) 通过自适应时间图分析帧间运动相关性的TCEP方法，(2) 在稀疏帧基础上进行高效注意力计算的SFT MHSA模块，(3) 利用聚类方法进行细粒度语义层剪枝的MGPTP过程。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上的实验表明，HTP训练MACs减少了38.5%，推理MACs减少了56.8%，推理速度平均提高了81.1%，同时性能达到最新水平。

Conclusion: HTP框架通过层次化动态剪枝减少计算成本，提升推理速度的同时保持了高性能，为3D人体姿态估计提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Print2Volume框架，利用2D指纹图像生成逼真的3D OCT指纹数据，提升了指纹识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT数据采集成本高且耗时，导致缺乏大规模数据集，限制了深度学习模型的开发。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：2D风格迁移模块，生成模拟OCT风格的灰度图；3D结构扩展网络，将2D图像扩展为合理的3D解剖结构；3D GAN结构细化器，使输出具有实际OCT特性。

Result: 生成42万样本的高质量合成数据集，极大提高了ZJUT-EIFD基准测试中指纹识别性能，EER从15.62%降至2.50%。

Conclusion: 通过使用合成数据预训练和小规模真实数据微调，有效解决了数据稀缺问题，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 手术录像手动分析极其耗时，需要开发计算机视觉与机器学习技术以提高效率。

Method: 创建并发布了一个由医学专家参与标注的子宫内膜异位症图像数据集 (GLENDA)。

Result: 发布了全球第一个子宫内膜异位症相关的图像注释数据集，可被用于医学图像分析的研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集将支持基于机器学习的医学研究，并提升妇科腹腔镜手术录像的自动化分析水平。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 当前手术视频记录已经变得普遍，但基于内容的索引和搜索仍然是一个挑战，特别是医疗视频的复杂性。研究的目的是改进器械的分割与识别技术，为医疗视频档案的自动化内容索引提供支持。

Method: 使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的手术器械分割和识别评估，包括二进制分割（区分器械与背景）和多类识别（器械类型识别）。

Result: 尽管训练数据较少，研究仍取得较高精度的器械定位与分割表现。但由于手术器械的相似性，特定器械的识别依然具有较大挑战。

Conclusion: 使用深度学习模型可有效分割手术器械背景，但进一步改进器械识别方法仍需解决复杂的相似性问题。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于WSI的元数据缺乏标准化，大量WSI的训练和验证选择过程需要依靠人工检查，这对大规模样本集合来说并不合适。

Method: 通过建议一种基于三层结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）的组织地图标准，赋予WSI集合详尽的内容标注，并使用共同的语法和语义实现不同目录之间的互操作性。

Result: 该方法通过案例证明了其在WSI目录、ML以及基于图的WSI表示中的优势与适用性，并增强了每个WSI收集的细节组织地图。

Conclusion: 研究提出的框架为WSI生成通用索引和分类信息，标志性地提高了大规模数据信息的可用性、可扩展性与互操作性。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“基于置信度的伪标签增量学习(ICPL)”的方法，主要在无标签数据集上进行增量学习，同时改善类增量学习（CIL）方法在真实场景中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的类增量学习方法假设新数据集是完全标注的，但在真实场景中获取标注数据的成本较高，因此迫切需要一种能够从无标注数据中学习的新方法。

Method: 开发了一种基于信心选择的伪标签方法，用于取代传统的人工标注，并结合现有的CIL方法，通过在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上验证性能，还与当前先进的class-iNCD方法进行了比较，并测试了方法的计算复杂性。

Result: ICPL在精度上与监督学习方法具有竞争力，并且比当前最先进的class-iNCD方法精度高5%以上，在细粒度数据集上的实用性也得到了验证。

Conclusion: ICPL为无标注环境中的增量学习提供了一种有效解决方案，展现了在资源受限环境中应用的可行性，并且在保持模型效果的同时减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Conclusion: MedShift提供了一种可扩展且具有广泛适用性的医疗影像域适配解决方案，其代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 轻量级图像描述模型具备在本地设备上替代大型多模态模型的潜力，结合改进框架后能够提升视觉特征捕捉和描述的准确性。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MME的新方法，将多种现有的OOD检测方法进行融合，其在多个基准测试中的表现超越了现有的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只专注于一种技术或特定类型的OOD数据，忽视了多种技术组合的潜力。

Method: 理论和实验证明了特征截断与评分函数的有效组合，同时提出了一个名为Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) 的新评分函数，融合了多种优秀的OOD检测器。

Result: 大规模与小规模基准测试中，尤其是在ImageNet-1K数据集上，MME相比现有方法提高了约6%。

Conclusion: MME通过多种方法的融合显著提升了OOD检测的效果，是一种更鲁棒、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 局部增强方法较传统方法更能有效减少背景干扰，提高对抗性攻击的效率和普适性，为更强健的遥感技术提供新的研究思路。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型对长视频内容处理不佳，特别是在语义聚合时易出现幻觉（SAH）。

Method: 通过构建专门的ELV-Halluc基准并引入新的数据集和方法（如位置编码和DPO策略），研究和缓解长视频中的SAH问题。

Result: 实验揭示SAH现象确实存在且随语义复杂度增加显著上升。新方法可显著降低幻觉率，最高减少27.7%。

Conclusion: 解决长视频语义聚合幻觉问题是提高模型表现的重要方向，新方法提供了有效的缓解途径。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 现有特征基础模型难以高效处理材料和生物显微图像中的大尺寸图像及微小特征。

Method: 研究中使用一个卷积神经网络，根据输入图像对低分辨率的基础模型特征进行上采样，并将此网络应用于显微镜图像的特征化和分割。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升显微图像分析效率，并减少了在细节丰富场景中的分割难度。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了HCCM框架，通过分层的对比和匹配学习提升无人机场景下的视觉-语言理解能力，相较于现有方法表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流视觉-语言模型在无人机广视角和复杂语义场景中缺乏对细粒度语义的理解能力，而现有分层方法对动态环境的适应性有限。

Method: 提出了HCCM框架，其核心包括：(1) RG-ITC，避免精确分区，通过对比局部视觉区域与全局文本捕捉分层语义；(2) RG-ITM，通过评估局部语义一致性增强全局跨模态表示中的组合推理。同时引入MCD机制，提高模型面对不完整或模糊描述的鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652上，HCCM在图像检索和文本检索中分别实现了28.8%的Recall@1和14.7%。在ERA数据集上，HCCM展示了强大的零样本泛化能力，取得39.93%的平均召回率，超越微调的基线模型。

Conclusion: HCCM通过多层次跨粒度对比和匹配学习显著增强了无人机场景中的视觉-语言对齐能力，具备优越的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Result: 该方法能够生成完整且可信的3D高斯点渲染结果，支持360度高质量的视觉效果，同时展示了生成多样性。

Conclusion: 本文通过一种生成式方法实现了从单张图像生成完整3D场景的能力，克服了传统方法的诸多局限，并提升了渲染质量和多样性。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，EZ-Sort与全面标注相比节省了90.5%的成本，与当前最佳实践相比节省了19.8%的成本，并保持或提高了标注一致性。

Conclusion: 将CLIP模型的推断结果与不确定性采样相结合，提供了一个高效、可扩展的成对排名解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Conclusion: ECHO显著提升了自我中心视角下HOI重建的效果，并具备灵活的输入配置能力。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法对时间动态分析有限，无法进行精细的空间预测，且技术上存在约束，需要解决此基础性问题。

Method: 提出TFM方法，通过学习时间分布，并设计为可以回退到最近图像预测的特殊情况，支持3D体积、多次扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上，TFM超越了自然影像的时空方法，建立了新的状态基准。

Conclusion: TFM在4D医疗影像预测方面表现优异，是一种先进且鲁棒的基线方法。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Conclusion: 行级OCR在文档图像处理上展现了显著优势，可与大语言模型未来的改进结合，具备良好拓展性和应用前景。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种整合术前CT影像与术后病理组织切片图像的多模态深度学习框架，用于预测肾透明细胞癌（ccRCC）的复发风险，并显示出相较传统Leibovich评分在个体化预测上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估ccRCC复发风险的Leibovich评分存在个体化分辨率低和未纳入影像信息的局限性，需要更先进的预测模型进行优化。

Method: 研究采用了模块化深度学习框架，结合预训练编码器和基于Cox模型的生存分析方法，在单模态和多模态（后融合和中融合）条件下测试其性能。

Result: 基于病理图像的模型性能优于仅使用CT的模型，最佳中融合模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分，而影像信息通过简单的嵌入拼接提升了预测效果。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在ccRCC个性化风险预测中的可行性，建议未来探索更高级的融合策略、更大规模数据集以及通用CT编码器的应用。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合深度展开网络（DUN）的计算全息图生成方法，分解为带宽保留模型（ABPM）与相位域复值去噪器（PCD），提升重建精度与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的计算全息图存在非线性及病态问题，当前算法多被视为黑盒处理，解释性与灵活性不足，同时难以捕捉长程依赖和全局特征，且现有基于角谱法（ASM）的模型受限于有限工作距离。

Method: 提出深度展开网络（DUN），包含自适应带宽保留模型（ABPM）与相位域复值去噪器（PCD）。ABPM扩展工作距离，PCD利用复值可变自注意力模块捕捉全局特征并改善性能。

Result: 实验在模拟和真实数据集上均展现了优越性能，峰值信噪比（PSNR）超过35 dB，达到当前最优。

Conclusion: 通过引入DUN的分解设计，增强了算法的可解释性与灵活性，解决了传统方法的局限性，在计算全息图生成任务中展示了较大潜力。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的病灶分割因示踪剂异质性、生理摄取和多中心差异性而具有挑战性，本文提出方法旨在解决这些问题并促进临床应用。

Method: 基于先前的nnU-Net流水线，扩展了用户交互提示功能，使用用户输入的前景和背景点击作为额外通道，并采用欧几里得距离变换（EDT）编码进行空间提示表示。

Result: 模型在交叉验证中表现出优异的性能，明显减少了假阳性和假阴性结果，与基线模型相比有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提示功能模型展示了其在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效用户引导分割工作流的潜力。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种基于概率投影和置信分数的新方法，用于从图像生成高精度自动驾驶地图（HD地图）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从图像到鸟瞰图（BEV）空间的映射中表现出泛化问题，容易误识别虚假的路面元素。

Method: 提出了一种基于几何映射结合概率投影的新机制，利用置信分数优化映射，并基于置信分数改进时间处理机制。

Result: 实验表明，相较于现有方法，新方法在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力，尤其在长距离感知场景中效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了HD地图生成的精度和泛化能力，且代码和模型已开源以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成数据需要大量计算资源和合成图像，其高成本限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出FLORA方法，基于Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过LoRA微调实现轻量级合成数据生成，支持消费级GPU操作。

Result: 使用FLORA生成的500张图像训练模型，在多个数据集上性能优于使用ODGEN基线生成的5000张图像，mAP@.50:.95的提升最高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了通过专注质量与效率的方法，比单纯依赖大量数据更高效，从而使合成数据生成更实用且更容易被实际采用。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了卷积神经网络(CNNs)在应对对抗性扰动攻击时的能力，并提出了一种基于激活熵的检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN尽管在计算机视觉领域表现优越，但对抗性扰动输入显著威胁了其鲁棒性，因而需要有效的方法来检测这些攻击，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 通过在VGG-16网络中监测激活熵变化，研究和捕捉对抗性输入是否在早期卷积层引起可检测的熵偏移。

Result: 实验表明对抗性输入在早期卷积层的激活熵变化达到7%，实现了90%的检测准确率且误报和漏报率低于20%。

Conclusion: CNN的激活模式天然包含分布变化的信息，因此可以通过激活熵监测来实时检测对抗性输入，无需改变原始模型结构且不影响性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出用于视觉问答（VQA）任务的CAD2DMD-SET工具，以改进大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)读取数字测量设备(DMDs)能力，尤其在复杂实际场景中表现突出，并通过生成和微调数据集显著提升模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理与数字设备（如数字测量设备）相关的简单任务中表现不佳，尤其是在现实复杂条件下。为克服这些局限性，需要全新的数据生成工具与高质量数据集来改进其性能。

Method: 提出了CAD2DMD-SET工具，通过利用3D CAD建模、高级渲染和图像合成技术生成多样化的VQA标注数据集，同时构建了DMDBench用于评估模型实际表现，并对现有LVLMs模型进行微调实验。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

TL;DR: 本文针对CLIP模型评估在野外实际场景下的域泛化性能（DG），提出了CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强域感知和域不变分类来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DG评估方式可能不足以测试基础模型（如CLIP）在真实未见数据场景中的表现。作者旨在更好地评估CLIP在域泛化能力上的表现。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：通过增加一个域头并引入合成多样域数据，增强CLIP编码器的域感知；通过去耦合设计，实现域感知特征和域不变分类的协同。

Result: 在特定的挑战性评估设置中（尤其是更多OOD的数据集上），CLIP-DCA相比现有方法显示了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 领域感知的增强对于基础模型域不变分类的高效实现是关键。CLIP-DCA方法为高挑战性的域泛化任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Motivation: 大多数现有研究聚焦于封闭数据集中的典型数据，未触及开放世界中非典型视频的探索，而人类在应对非典型新概念时表现出色，这激发了研究动机。

Method: 提出一个包含非典型视频数据（如科幻、动画等）的新数据集，用于模型训练，研究其对三个关键任务的影响：OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频在视觉表征学习中的价值被验证，同时新数据集的提出为该领域的进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning

*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于nnU-Net框架的多阶段预训练策略，用于MRI中的胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）自动分割，并在PANTHER挑战中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决了由于PDAC肿瘤组织对比度低、标注数据稀缺导致的自动分割困难问题。

Method: 利用nnU-Net框架，结合多阶段级联预训练策略，包括泛解剖学模型、CT胰腺病灶和MRI目标数据的逐级微调。此外，通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强策略及训练计划。

Result: 针对不同增强策略的取舍，最佳结果为Task 1肿瘤Dice分数达0.661，Task 2达0.523；并在边界精度（MASD 5.46 mm，HD95 17.33 mm）达到前沿水平。

Conclusion: 提出的混合专家模型成为在有限数据和复杂医学影像任务中开发高性能深度学习模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究开发了GPT-5，一种专门针对肿瘤学领域的语言模型，其在放射肿瘤学的多项测试中表现优于前代版本（GPT-3.5及GPT-4）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过新的大语言模型（GPT-5）提升放射肿瘤学决策支持的潜力。

Method: 使用两种评估方法：一是ACR辐射肿瘤学培训考试，二是包括60个放射肿瘤学病例的治疗方案生成评估，由专家根据正确性等指标打分。

Result: GPT-5在ACR考试中准确率达92.8%，显著优于GPT-3.5和GPT-4；在病例治疗生成评估中，其正确性与全面性获得高评分，虚假生成现象极少。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学上取得了显著进展，但仍需专业人士监督其在临床中的应用，以避免重大错误。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

*Jiawei Liu,Jiahe Hou,Wei Wang,Jinsong Du,Yang Cong,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于三记忆库框架 (TMUAD) 的方法，用于结构和逻辑异常检测，显著提高了检测性能并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决在异常检测中经常因正常数据有限而导致的挑战，提升结构和逻辑异常检测能力。

Method: 提出了三记忆库框架 (TMUAD)，包括：1) 基于逻辑描述的类级文本记忆库；2) 保持完整物体轮廓的对象级图像记忆库；3) 用于结构异常检测的补丁级图像记忆库。通过多级别计算异常分数并融合得到最终分数。

Result: TMUAD 框架在包含工业和医疗领域的7个公开数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同的多记忆库方法，该框架成功统一了结构和逻辑异常检测，提供了异常检测的全新有效方法，且代码已开源可供使用。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VoCap的视频模型，用于生成时空掩码和对象中心的描述文字，解决了可提示的视频对象分割、指代表达式分割和对象描述等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解中对细粒度的定位掩码和语义属性的研究是基础任务，因此需要一个灵活的模型来统一解决多类视频对象任务。

Method: 提出了VoCap模型，可以通过输入视频和各种模式的提示生成时空掩码和描述。同时，引入SAV-Caption数据集，通过大规模视觉语言模型生成伪对象描述用于训练模型。

Result: VoCap在指代表达式视频对象分割任务上实现了最先进的表现，在半监督视频对象分割任务上具有竞争力，并为视频对象描述任务建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型和SAV-Caption数据集为视频对象的分割和描述引入了新的解决方案并拓展了相关研究的可能性。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出情景识别(SR)任务的新方法，解决了传统模型未能处理视觉事件识别中多义性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类作为单标签问题处理，但未能解决视觉事件中多个动词类别的语义重叠问题。

Method: 重新将动词分类建模为单正多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，并设计了结合图神经网络和对抗训练的GE-VerbMLP模型，同时建立了多标签评估基准。

Result: 在真实数据集上取得了超过3%的平均精确度(MAP)提升，同时对传统的top-1和top-5准确性仍具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 重新定义动词分类为多标签问题并提出的新模型显著提升了情景识别的性能，为后续研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前大语言模型和多模态模型在驾驶知识和复杂场景下的理解能力，以及通过新基准改进模型表现的潜力。

Method: 开发DriveQA基准，覆盖交通规则、标志和场景，对模型在基本和复杂驾驶任务上的表现进行实验研究，并分析调优和不同环境变量对模型的影响。

Result: 1. LLMs和MLLMs在基础驾驶任务表现优秀，但在复杂场景如数值推理和空间布局上表现不足；2. 在DriveQA上的微调提升了各类别的准确率，特别是在标志识别和交叉口决策上；3. DriveQA-V分析揭示了环境因素对模型敏感性的影响；4. 预训练在DriveQA上提升了对实际数据集上的表现，并显示模型可以通过内部化交通知识提升任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: DriveQA证明了在复杂驾驶场景中，现有的模型有待改进，同时也展示了基于该基准微调和预训练的潜力，推动模型在真实驾驶任务中的表现。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CoBA（CounterBias Augmentation）的通用框架，用于通过语义三元组的重新构建生成抗偏见数据，从而减少深度学习模型在训练数据中对虚假关联的依赖，同时提高泛化性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型通常会利用训练数据中的非目标特征（如虚假关联）来进行预测，但这会导致在未见过的数据上表现不佳和泛化问题。

Method: 提出了一种更通用的反事实数据增强形式，称为CounterBias Augmentation (CoBA)。该方法通过分解文本为主谓宾三元组（subject-predicate-object triples）并有选择性地修改这些三元组来破坏虚假关联。随后基于调整后的三元组重新生成文本，得到减少了偏见的反偏见数据。

Result: 通过大量实验，CoBA证明不仅能提高下游任务的性能，还能有效减少偏见，并增强模型的分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoBA 提供了一个通用且强大的解决方案，解决了深度学习模型因虚假关联而产生的挑战，显著提升模型的抗偏见性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Motivation: 现有毒性言论数据缺乏对年龄等人口统计背景的考量，限制了我们对不同年龄群体在线交流方式的理解。

Method: 研究创建了一个德文毒性言论数据集，包括3,024条人工标注评论及30,024条由LLM标注的评论，来源于Instagram、TikTok和YouTube。使用预定义毒性关键词筛选评论，并结合人类专家与先进语言模型来标注毒性类别。

Result: 发现不同年龄群体在毒性言论模式上存在差异：年轻用户更倾向使用富有表现力的语言，老年用户更常参与散布虚假信息和贬低性评论。

Conclusion: 该数据集为探索不同人口统计群体的语言变异提供了新机会，有助于开发更公平、兼顾年龄差异的内容审核系统。

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Motivation: 研究认知偏见如何影响LLM的可靠性，特别是在价格谈判中受锚定效应的影响。

Method: 使用实验对LLM在价格谈判中如何产生和受到锚定效应的影响进行客观和主观评估。

Result: 发现推理模型较不易受锚定效应影响，长链思维可缓解该效应；未发现个性特质与锚定效应敏感性相关。

Conclusion: 这些发现加深了对LLM中认知偏见的理解，有助于确保LLM应用过程中的安全性与责任感。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

Motivation: 当前研究多聚焦于复杂任务如编码、数学和科学，但鲜有研究测试MLLMs在基础感知任务上的表现。

Method: 设计并引入了包含7200张程式生成图像的Percept-V数据集，涵盖30种类型的基本视觉感知能力测试，并对比测试多种MLLMs和大型推理模型（LRMs）。

Result: 测试结果表明，尽管MLLMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但在问题复杂性增加时，其表现显著下降，且不同认知技能的难度系数并不一致。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基础感知任务中表现受限，亟需进一步优化其感知能力，特别是在处理复杂性增长的任务时。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过实验分析ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude在自评和交叉评估中存在的偏差以及标签对评估结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型评估过程中可能存在的偏差，以及如何改进评估公平性。

Method: 通过设置四种标签条件，分析ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude的博文在整体偏好投票和细化质量评分（包括连贯性、信息量和简洁性）上的表现，评分用百分比表示。

Result: 发现标签显著影响评估结果，如“Claude”标签提高得分，“Gemini”标签降低得分，假标签导致得分和排名显著变化。

Conclusion: 模型身份感知会严重影响高层次评估，并微妙地影响详细评分，建议采用盲评或多模型评估协议以确保公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

*Deepro Choudhury,Sinead Williamson,Adam Goliński,Ning Miao,Freddie Bickford Smith,Michael Kirchhof,Yizhe Zhang,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用序列贝叶斯实验设计（BED）框架来提升大语言模型（LLMs）智能获取信息能力的新方法，即BED-LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高大语言模型在多轮对话中智能、适应性从用户或外部来源获取信息的能力。

Method: 在每一轮交互中迭代选择可最大化任务相关信息增益（EIG）的问题或查询，通过LLM的概率模型构建，在此基础上进行了EIG估计器设计、条件更新优化及候选查询策略制定等创新。

Result: 相较于直接提示或其他设计策略，BED-LLM在20题游戏及用户偏好推断等测试中表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 采用BED-LLM方法能有效增强大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，包括交互式信息获取及外部环境对接等。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

*Arash Ahmadi,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Banad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种基于强化学习的自动化HFACS分类框架，用于改进航空安全分析。成果显著，提高分类准确性并优于现有大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS方法在航空事故分析中的可扩展性和一致性有限，需开发新方法提升其效果。

Method: 提出基于GRPO强化学习优化的Llama-3.1 8B语言模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成，解决数据不平衡问题并提升分类性能。

Result: 达到350%的准确性提升（从0.0400到0.1800）和0.8800的部分匹配准确性，明显优于GPT-5-mini等先进语言模型。

Conclusion: 小型化、领域优化的模型可在资源受限设备上高效部署，为航空安全分析提供低延迟且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于像素的生成式语言模型，以增强对多语言字符干扰的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词器和嵌入表的词外问题，提升语言模型对输入扰动的稳定性。

Method: 用像素化表示替代文本嵌入，将单词渲染为图像，并对多语言文本提供扩展适配能力。

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准上，证明了其对正字法干扰的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的语言模型设计有效提升了对多语言字符输入的适应性和对噪声的抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究自监督语音模型（S3Ms）是否存在语言的关键期效应，发现未显现出明确的关键期效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨S3Ms在语言学习中的表现，以验证其是否符合人类语言学习的关键期理论。

Method: 通过训练不同L2曝光开始时间和L1曝光结束时间的S3Ms，并测试其音位辨别性能。

Result: 未发现模型存在关键期效应；L2学习延迟反而表现更好，L1延迟暴露则引发遗忘。

Conclusion: S3Ms不表现出人类语言学习中典型的关键期效应。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的解码记忆管道(DMP)，以提高大语言模型(LLMs)生成的效率，同时维持生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测LLMs幻觉的方法在处理句子级生成效果差，或依赖领域特定知识。此外，现有的自一致性方法效率较低，需要多次生成。

Method: 研究自一致性方法中存在的冗余，提出了解码记忆管道(DMP)，结合选择性推理和退火解码进行高效生成。

Result: 实验表明，DMP在不影响AUROC性能的情况下，可以将生成速度提高至3倍。

Conclusion: DMP方法在提升生成效率的同时保持了性能，并具有应用于对齐和推理任务的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Conclusion: 本文验证了构建代码嵌入模型的新方法是有效的。

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

non-English contexts. We present an updated version of the BLUEX dataset, now
including 2024-2025 exams and automatically generated image captions using
state-of-the-art models, enhancing its relevance for data contamination studies
in LLM pretraining. Captioning strategies increase accessibility to text-only
models by more than 40%, producing 1,422 usable questions, more than doubling
the number in the original BLUEX. We evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs
and their ability to leverage visual context through captions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's

LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and

TL;DR: 本文提出重新从正常性的概念审视图灵测试，认为其目标是普通而非卓越的人类智力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于通过对正常性及统计学概念的探索，更好地理解图灵测试及其局限。

Method: 从正常性和统计学角度分析图灵测试，以探讨其目标和评估标准的意义。

Result: 提出图灵测试考察的是平均水平的人类智力，当前的大型语言模型如ChatGPT更倾向于卓越智能表现，因此更接近于“人工聪明”而非真正的人工智能。

Conclusion: 图灵测试的意义取决于人类心智是否能简化为普通/平均心智，这一问题超出图灵测试本身的范围，涉及对正常主义范式的深层次反思。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 探讨自动文本摘要评价中复现性差的问题，从而揭示现有方法的不足，并寻找改进方案。

Method: 通过对六种代表性评价指标（如ROUGE和基于大型语言模型的G-Eval、SEval-Ex）在SummEval数据集上的对比实验来分析这些指标的复现性和稳定性。

Result: 指标中与人类判断高度一致的方法通常需要高计算资源，且在多次实验中表现不稳定。另外，大型语言模型在评价中的随机性和有限复现性引发了担忧。

Conclusion: 需要更加健全的评价协议，包括详尽的文档记录和方法标准化，以提高自动摘要评估的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Result: 对一系列自动评审生成方法的测试表明，研究逻辑中的缺陷对评审输出影响不显著。

Conclusion: 基于测试结果，作者提出了三点可实施建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench是首个专门为医学场景设计的评估基准，为改进医学大模型和评分系统提供了宝贵的工具和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有语义表示方法通常依赖于预定义的宽泛语义维度，无法捕捉更精细的语义差异，需要一种能够更好解析语义结构的方法。

Method: 引入一种解耦的连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定语义信息。使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到脑激活数据中以评估其神经可行性。

Result: 发现了可解释的、更细粒度的语义子维度，这些维度遵循不同的结构原则，并且极性是驱动其分解的关键因素。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够生成解释性更强的语义子维度，这些子维度在认知和神经科学中具有可行性，推进了语义表示和脑-语言机制的研究。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的“意识形态深度”，即其内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，并利用“可引导性”测试和稀疏自编码器进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前，LLMs展现出明确的意识形态倾向，但其观点的稳定性与深度尚待研究，尤其是表层反应是否反映了内在连贯的意识形态尚不明确。

Method: 采用双重方法：通过指令引导和激活引导测试模型在意识形态之间转变的可引导性；通过稀疏自编码器探测模型内部机制，并量化意识形态特征的深度。

Result: 研究发现，一些模型很容易在意识形态之间切换，而另一些则表现出较强的抗拒或拒绝倾向；分析还表明，可引导性较低的模型具有更清晰且抽象的意识形态特征。例如，一个模型拥有的政治特征数量是类似大小的另一个模型的7.3倍，且核心政治特征移除后的结果与模型深度相关。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的一种可量化特性，而可引导性提供了很好的视角来了解其潜在的政治体系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索了通过新的激励策略提升7B参数的小型语言模型（SLM）的创作能力，专注于生成中文问候语，其中主要提出了两种奖励策略，并发现基于原则指导的LLM判定模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型创造力有限的问题，减少对人力注解数据的依赖，同时降低成本。

Method: 提出两种奖励策略：1. 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的偏好模型（RM）。2. 使用基于原则指导的LLM作为裁判，结合对抗训练与反思机制的奖励信号优化方法。

Result: 通过实验发现，两种方法均显著提升了模型创意输出质量，但基于原则的LLM裁判模型生成效果最佳，同时提升了训练效率并减少了人类注解数据的需求。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于原则指导的奖励策略是一条提升小型语言模型创造能力的可扩展且有效的路径，能够显著优化创意写作生成质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Motivation: 虚假新闻在公共健康、政治等领域带来重大影响，而现有集成方法过于依赖分类器多样性，因此需要优化分类器选择以提高鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 提出一种新颖的自动化分类器选择方法，通过计算多样性、应用层次聚类划分组，再用HierarchySelect算法选择最佳分类器池以构建集成模型，同时关注分类器性能。

Result: 实验选取40种分类器和6个数据集进行对比，新方法在其中两个数据集上取得最高准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡分类器多样性与性能，增强了集成模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5

privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization

specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review
evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型依赖高质量的训练数据，但现有的数据选择与生成方法难以适应模型能力的动态变化。

Method: 提出了一种动态数据优化框架Middo，包括：（1）通过三轴模型信号（复杂性、嵌入聚类动态、质量）诊断次优样本；（2）转换次优样本为高价值训练点，同时保留语义完整性；（3）优化过程随模型能力动态演进。

Result: 实验证明Middo可以在保持原数据集规模的情况下，将模型精度平均提升7.15%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种动态人机共进的持续大语言模型训练新范式，有助于推进数据与模型的共同演化。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Motivation: 随着LLMs日益融入日常工作流程，研究探索用户的人格特点是否影响其对不同LLMs的偏好。

Method: 招募32名参与者（4种Keirsey人格类型），使用GPT-4和Claude 3.5进行四个协作任务，并对结果和用户反馈进行分析。

Result: Rational类型用户更偏好GPT-4，尤其在目标导向任务中；Idealist类型用户更倾向Claude 3.5，尤其是创意和分析任务。其他人格类型的偏好依任务而定。

Conclusion: 个性化分析揭示了LLMs的差异，传统评价方法难以发现这些差异，表明需考虑用户人格进行模型选择。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Conclusion: 高质量、多样化的数据对于提升检索模型至关重要，结合LLM的生成能力，可进一步优化嵌入模型的数据质量。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are

Method: 构建了实用的Misviz数据集合和其合成版本Misviz-synth，以支持AI模型训练，所有数据集基于真实世界的图表和规则生成。

Result: 通过对当前最先进的多模态模型以及其他方法进行评估，结果表明识别误导性图表仍是一个很大的挑战。

Conclusion: Misviz和Misviz-synth为未来研发提供基础，公开数据与代码以推进研究进展。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的核心参数隔离微调（CPI-FT）框架，旨在缓解监督微调中因参数更新不当而导致的任务干扰和遗忘问题，大幅提升多任务微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前监督微调（SFT）中由于无差别参数更新造成的“跷跷板现象”，即提升某些任务性能却以牺牲其他任务为代价。

Method: 提出核心参数隔离微调（CPI-FT）框架，通过独立微调及参数更新量的量化识别各任务的核心参数区域；基于核心区域的重叠性对任务进行分组建模；使用球面线性插值（SLERP）融合非核心参数，并在后续训练中冻结核心区域以防遗忘。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，CPI-FT方法显著缓解了任务间的干扰和遗忘现象，在多任务和多阶段微调任务中均超越传统基线方法。

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架有效提高了大语言模型在多任务监督微调下的整体性能，证明了其在减少任务干扰和防止遗忘方面的优势。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在需要推理能力的回归任务（RiR）上的研究较为稀缺，而这种任务通常数据稀少且计算资源有限，本文希望借此填补此研究空白。

Method: 将三种实际问题设定为RiR任务以建立基准测试，测试了冷冻语言模型的提示方法和微调Transformer编码器，然后提出利用批量反射式提示优化和神经网络集成学习的新方法（MENTAT）。

Result: MENTAT在基准测试中相比现有方法（提示冷冻语言模型和微调Transformer编码器）取得了高达65%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT显著优于现有方法，但在推理密集型回归任务（RiR）领域仍有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Result: 在多个基准上实现显著性能提升，例如在MATH500数据集上提升+10.18，在AIME2025数据集上提升+9.81，并且使用更少的样本量超过现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 正确的推理链具有显著更高的推理置信度和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples

tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了LINKO，一个用LLM增强的整合本体学习框架，通过在异质本体系统中实现双轴知识传播来提升医学概念表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常只关注单一本体系统或孤立的多本体系统的知识整合，忽略了跨本体的联系，这限制了概念表示学习的效果。

Method: LINKO利用LLMs初始化本体概念嵌入，将本体描述与上下文相结合，随后通过在层次内外的垂直和水平传播共同学习多种本体图中的医学概念。

Result: LINKO在两个公共数据集上的实验结果显示，其性能超过了最先进的基线模型。

Conclusion: 作为与现有电子健康记录预测模型兼容的插件编码器，LINKO在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中展现了更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出TiG框架，通过交互式游戏环境训练LLMs，成功弥合声明性知识和程序性知识之间的差距，同时减少数据和计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但在简单的交互任务中表现差，暴露了声明性知识与程序性知识之间的差距。当前RL代理需要大量训练数据，并缺乏透明性，不适合高效转换LLM知识为动态决策能力。

Method: 提出TiG框架，将RL决策问题重新设计为语言建模任务，通过在线强化学习和环境反馈迭代优化语言指导的策略，训练LLMs进行互动决策。

Result: TiG不仅以较低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统RL方法性能相当的结果，还提供了任务决策的逐步自然语言解释，提升了透明性。

Conclusion: TiG框架成功结合了LLMs的推理能力与RL的程序性学习能力，显著增强了复杂交互任务中的性能，并改善了模型的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的评估基准AHELM，用于全面衡量多模态音频-语言模型（ALMs）的性能，涵盖10个关键方面，并引入了两个新的合成数据集，支持透明性和长期更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化的基准来全面评估音频-语言模型，现有评估方法在能力覆盖和模型比较上存在局限。

Method: 引入AHELM基准，包括新的数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench，标准化了模型提示、推理参数和评价指标，跨越10个性能评估维度并测试14种ALMs与基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个指标中排名第一的占5个，但存在显著的不公平性问题；基线系统中有一个模型尽管仅具备语音转文字能力，但整体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了系统性和透明性，可以促进音频-语言模型的公平比较和未来改进，是一个持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Conclusion: 通过认知状态分析提升了遗忘操作的层次，形成了一个全面的理论框架，为遗忘操作的研究和实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

TL;DR: 本研究讨论如何从滑块拼图的随机状态-动作轨迹中学习提升的STRIPS模型，提出了新变体STRIPS+及其学习算法SYNTH。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设动作轨迹具有完整的STRIPS动作或领域谓词是可观察的，这不够现实。本研究旨在解决一个更接近现实的模型学习问题，即部分状态和动作信息缺失的情况下，学习STRIPS模型。

Method: 引入新变体STRIPS+，允许隐式动作参数和有限的存在量化形式条件。基于此，开发了一种新的学习算法SYNTH，构建每一动作的分层前置条件表达式来唯一定位对象并补充隐式参数。

Result: SYNTH算法被证明在正确性和完备性上是成立的，并在从现有STRIPS领域衍生的STRIPS+模型中进行的状态-动作轨迹数据测试中表现出可扩展性。

Conclusion: SYNTH为学习部分信息缺失的STRIPS+模型提供了一种新的工具，扩展了传统STRIPS学习的范围，具有理论上的正确性和实践上的有效性。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个面向多模态模型的高难度基准，评估这些模型在细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长远工具使用等多模态任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试多依赖于简单的图像搜索和文本遮罩，而忽略了复杂的多模态挑战。作者希望提供一个能真实反映模型多模态理解能力的评估基准。

Method: 创建了311个任务的MMSearch-Plus基准，通过空间和时间线索外推问题，要求多模态模型综合利用微弱的视觉信号和文本搜索，并在检索中验证答案的准确性。

Result: 在该基准中，表现最好的闭源模型(o3)准确率为15.1%（无搜索）和36.0%（带搜索）；而强大的开源模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct)准确率分别为0.0%和6.9%。

Conclusion: 目前的多模态语言模型在复杂任务中的表现有限，未来需要改进其在长远规划、细节推理和来源验证等方面的能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Result: 证明生成反事实场景的成本接近规划问题求解成本，展现其实用性。

Conclusion: 提供了一个具备实际可能性的框架用于设计算法，在解释和规划联合领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Motivation: 目前的传统标志提取算法存在局限性，无法有效处理跨领域问题，需要一种能自动推广的解决方案。

Method: 通过从已解决实例中学习，利用状态函数创建“泛化标志图”，描述规划问题的中间目标，并在新实例中作为启发式计算。

Conclusion: 泛化标志图能够发掘领域信息，这些信息不仅具有可解释性，而且对自动化规划非常有用，从少量领域计划中即可学得。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the

*Yang You,Alex Schutz,Zhikun Li,Bruno Lacerda,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出确定性去中心化部分可观察Markov决策过程（Det-Dec-POMDPs）模型及其求解方法IDPP，用于解决多智能体高层规划任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于确定性动作和观测的多智能体规划任务当前仍缺乏高效求解方法，尤其在大规模问题中现有方法效率不足。

Method: 设计了一种名为IDPP的迭代求解方法，基于Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies框架优化解决Det-Dec-POMDPs问题。

Result: 该方法实现了在现有Dec-POMDP求解器无法有效解决的大规模问题中的高效求解。

Conclusion: 提出的IDPP方法为解决多智能体高阶规划提供了新的高效方法，迈向更复杂任务领域。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个整合框架，将传统网络优化模型与大语言模型结合，为供应链规划提供交互性、可解释性和角色感知的决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在弥合复杂运筹学输出与业务利益相关者理解之间的差距，优化供应链规划中的决策支持。

Method: 通过混合整数模型实现战术库存再分配，结合AI代理、RESTful API和动态用户界面，提供实时交互和基于模拟的洞察。

Result: 案例研究表明，该系统能有效避免缺货、降低成本并维持服务水平。

Conclusion: 系统提高了规划效果，未来可通过私有LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络增强模型的可解释性和适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种在多启发式A* (MHA*) 的基础上扩展的任意时间版本（A-MHA*），能够快速找到次优解并不断改进结果，适用于复杂的搜索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主要受到启发启发性算法设计难度大以及现有MHA*算法难以改进解的时间限制。

Method: 将Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) 的概念精确地应用到MHA*框架中，以构建出新的任意时间MHA* (A-MHA*) 算法。

Result: A-MHA*在3D路径规划和滑动拼图领域表现优异，与其他任意时间算法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: A-MHA*不仅保留了原始MHA*算法的次优性和完备性保证，同时提升了算法的任意时间性能，适合快速生成解并逐步优化的场景。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MEDLEY的新框架，通过保留和利用AI模型的多样性来改进医学诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学人工智能的偏差通常被视为需要消除的缺陷，但作者认为偏差可能是不可避免且有价值的，试图通过一个新框架将其转化为资源。

Method: 框架MEDLEY以多AI模型协作为核心，保持模型输出的多样性，利用偏差并将生成性错误视为医生校验的假设。

Result: 开发了基于30多个大语言模型的概念验证系统，既保留了一致性也保留了少数意见，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏差透明化。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI的局限性为资源，开启了制定可信医学AI系统的新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的新框架PosterForest，用于自动生成科学海报，通过Poster Tree表示来结合文献结构和文本-视觉关系，显著提高海报质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了科学文献的层次结构及文本和视觉元素的语义整合，需解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了无训练的PosterForest框架，引入Poster Tree表示文献的层级结构和视觉文本关系，并通过多代理协作进行内容总结和布局规划。

Result: 实验表明，与现有基线相比，该方法在定性和定量评估中均表现更好，生成海报的质量接近专家设计，信息保留、结构清晰度和用户偏好显著提升。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架有效解决了科学海报生成中的挑战，改进了逻辑一致性、内容真实性和视觉连贯性。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种用于解决旅行商问题（TSP）的变分算法，通过一种压缩的排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略来减少量子比特的需求并加速算法实施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种适用于近似中期量子计算设备（NISQ硬件）的高效算法，解决旅行商以及类似复杂优化问题。

Method: 结合压缩的排列编码与优化-冻结-重用策略，首次利用模拟退火优化电路拓扑，并将此拓扑固定以用于快速重新优化新实例的电路参数。

Result: 在实验的40组随机对称的4-7城市问题中，对4城市的平均最优采样概率为100%，5城市为90%，6城市为80%，7城市时降至约20%，表明算法的可扩展性局限。

Conclusion: 方法在中等规模问题上展现出鲁棒的泛化能力，通过冻结电路拓扑显著减少求解时间，但受限于扩展性和硬件性能，建议扩展应用于更复杂的优化问题如车辆路径和作业车间调度。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于时间序列分析中的因果结构难以完全明确，研究其高级摘要形式（总结因果图）有利于理解主要因果关系。

Method: 提供条件以确保基于总结因果图及相关假设下，可以可靠地定向时间变量之间的微观因果边。

Result: 证明了即使在宏观级别有循环或双向边的情况下，也能实现微观因果边的定向，并提出了相应的理论保障。

Conclusion: 结果表明，总结因果图可帮助复杂时间系统中的因果发现，提高从观测时间序列数据进行因果推断的能力，同时证明了专家知识的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TDP的零样本测试规划框架，通过树搜索和双层采样生成策略，实现了在多种任务环境下超越现有方法的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于预训练扩散模型的规划方法在非凸、不连续及多目标任务中效果有限，同时依赖任务特定的训练限制了其灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出TDP框架，将测试时规划作为树搜索问题，通过多样化的粒子引导和快速条件去噪，生成探索性和任务导向性兼备的轨迹集合。只依赖预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在迷宫找金、机器人操作和AntMaze多目标探测三种任务中，TDP都优于最先进的既有方法，在不同任务下展现了稳定的优越性能。

Conclusion: TDP通过改进探索与开发的平衡，扩展了解空间并有效利用梯度信息，成功克服现有方法在复杂场景中的局限性，为零样本测试规划提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种模仿临床团队诊断过程的多代理系统（MAS），通过协作和动态分配改善临床问题识别的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前单个语言模型在复杂高风险的临床场景中表现有限，缺乏足够的鲁棒性。本研究旨在通过模拟多代理协作，增强临床诊断自动化的准确性与可解释性。

Method: 设计了一个多代理系统，其中“经理”代理指导多个“专家”代理参与分层、迭代的辩论过程，以分析SOAP记录中的主观和客观内容并得出临床问题的识别结果。

Result: 在420篇MIMIC-III数据集上实验表明，动态多代理系统在识别心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症方面表现优于单一代理模型。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，多代理系统提供了一种更精确、鲁棒且具有可解释性的临床决策支持工具潜力。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Method: 提出一种混合的字符串相似性、主题建模、层次聚类与基于规则的管道方法，并设计了基于精度和召回率的评估指标，用于处理银行支付系统中的交易对手方聚类。

Result: 在真实标签数据集上测试，该方法在性能上显著优于基线规则（关键词匹配）方法，同时保留了基于规则系统的解释性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法不仅提高了自动化交易对手方聚类的准确性，还减少了人工审查的需求，对部分子集的调查如制裁调查也提供了更好的控制与风险管理。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

TL;DR: 文章提出一种基于EEG的多粒度情感分类框架，使用GAMEEMO数据集，实验表明LSTM-GRU模型在不同任务上性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于二元情感分类或特定个体分类，缺乏适用于现实场景的通用方法。

Method: 利用EEG信号，结合时序分割、统计与频域特征提取、z-score标准化，设计了多层次情感分类策略，并评估了多种机器学习和深度学习模型表现。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型在多个任务中表现最优，在二元情感分类任务取得0.932 F1分数，多分类准确率94.5%，多标签分类90.6%。

Conclusion: 多粒度EEG情感分类框架具备高度鲁棒性和推广性，特别是LSTM-GRU模型具有显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Conclusion: PVPO方法有效解决了群体策略方法的累积偏差问题，并大幅降低了Rollouts的依赖性，显著提升了训练效率与结果。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaGram优化器，通过高效的全矩阵自适应梯度更新，解决了现有方法无法捕捉参数相关性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法由于使用对角预条件矩阵，难以有效捕获参数间的相关性，从而限制了优化性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为AdaGram的新优化器，通过快速对称分解高效计算预条件更新方向，并结合矩阵积分器方法，保持优化过程中低秩预条件结构，以降低内存和计算开销。

Result: 在标准机器学习任务的数值实验中，即使选择低秩近似，AdaGram也能比对角自适应优化器更快收敛或匹配其性能。

Conclusion: AdaGram被证明是一种在大规模模型中进行自适应优化的可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

TL;DR: 研究旨在通过机器学习技术和强化学习子系统检测NASA深空网络（DSN）中的异常数据，并实现全自动化的数据管道系统用于数据处理和异常分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSN的天线和发射器会随着时间出现退化，可能导致数据流中断和深空任务通信中断，因此需要一种自动化方法监测异常情况并指导维修。

Method: 结合机器学习技术进行数据重建和预测，并通过统计计算识别异常；融入强化学习子系统按严重性分类异常；利用大规模语言模型生成异常解释；开发从数据提取到处理的完整数据管道，并集成智能决策AI系统。

Result: 成功开发了完整的数据管道系统，用于DSN异常检测，并通过集成AI系统完成对异常数据的分类和预测工作。

Conclusion: 研究证明，结合机器学习和强化学习技术建立的多功能AI系统能够提升DSN天线设施的检测效率，从而保证深空任务的通信稳定性。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文赌博机的新方法，用于自然语言处理中的动态选择适合的语言模型（LLM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设已知任务和语言模型之间的最佳匹配，但现实中缺乏此类映射且用户查询动态变化。需要一种适应性更强的LLM选择方法。

Method: 将LLM分配问题建模为上下文赌博机问题，提出以首选项为先的LinUCB扩展（PILOT），通过离线偏好数据建模嵌入空间，并在线通过赌博机反馈优化。

Result: 成功实现了基于资源效率的语言模型路由，通过解决多选背包问题来满足不同预算的需求。

Conclusion: PILOT方法提供了一种高效、适应性强的方案，用于解决动态语言模型选择中的实际问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

TL;DR: 研究设计了一种新型会员推断攻击方法，名为Gen-LRA，用于评估生成模型生成的合成数据的隐私泄露风险，其表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成数据隐私泄露审计问题，现有方法局限性较大，需要更先进的攻击方法来检测生成模型的隐私暴露问题。

Method: 提出了Gen-LRA，这是一种无箱（No-Box）会员推断攻击，基于测试观测的影响，通过评估生成数据中局部似然比估计的变化来进行攻击，无需模型知识或访问权。

Result: 通过对多样化数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的综合基准测试表明，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上优于其他会员推断攻击方法。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA验证生成模型过拟合导致的隐私风险在真实应用中的显著性，是合成数据隐私审计的有效工具。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Result: 实验表明，DeepResESN在各种时间序列任务中优于传统的浅层和深层Reservoir Computing方法。

Conclusion: DeepResESN有效地改进了ESN的长期处理能力，为时间序列任务设立了更优的架构选择。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多针对特定模型或依赖树的离散结构，难以推广至复杂模型并在大规模数据上效率欠佳。

Result: FUTURE算法在实际数据集上的实验表现出显著的成功遗忘性能。

Conclusion: FUTURE算法克服了现有树集成遗忘方法的局限性，为隐私保护需求下的树模型应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种在概率单纯形上描述大语言模型解码的变分原理，并分析了其动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对于大语言模型解码的描述局限于对softmax过程的基本理解，缺乏更深层次的理论背景及动态分析。

Method: 使用约束变分原理，结合乘性权重更新和复制流，构建了文本生成的动态模型，并对其进行了理论分析。

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，下一令牌分布沿单纯形内的平滑轨迹收敛至softmax平衡点。

Conclusion: 文章阐述了温度、top-k和核采样等因素对生成动态的影响，并提供了对路径依赖性和幻觉式行为的有控制的描述。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

TL;DR: 研究强调了在强化学习( RL)应用于大语言模型(LLMs)时表现出的反直觉现象，其表现只在预训练模型与任务高度匹配时有效。通过严格实验验证，标准RL训练在更具挑战性情况下依然表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来语言模型与强化学习结合引发的独特现象及其原理尚未被全面理解，研究动机是探究这些现象的适用条件及其失败原因。

Method: 通过系统性实验与大规模对比验证了模型任务一致性( Model-Task Alignment）对强化学习技术有效性的影响。

Result: 研究证明反直觉现象仅在模型任务高度匹配时成立，而在任务更具挑战性时，标准RL仍然是有效且可靠的解决方案。

Conclusion: 预训练模型与任务的一致性是决定特定强化学习技术成功的关键因素，全面理解这一因素有助于更有效地应用强化学习方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自组织映射(SOMs)和变分自编码器(VAEs)的新型生成式连续学习框架，目标是实现内存高效的重播，无需存储原始数据或任务标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决当前连续学习中依赖存储原始数据样本和任务标签的问题，提出一种内存高效且无任务标签的生成式学习方法。

Method: 在高维数据（如CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100）上，SOM通过VAE的潜变量空间操作；在低维数据（如MNIST和FashionMNIST）中，独立操作。为每个SOM单元存储均值、方差和协方差，用于生成未来学习迭代的合成样本。

Result: 在标准类增量基准测试中，其性能与目前内存基方法竞争，并优于无内存方法；在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的单类增量性能提升近10%和7%。

Conclusion: 该方法显示了作为一种可扩展的、无需任务标签的和内存高效的连续学习解决方案的潜力，且可用作训练后的生成模型。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于专家混合模型（MoE）的元学习框架，以结合多种神经网络架构的优势，提高计算流体力学(CFD)模拟中代理模型的预测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真计算流体力学(CFD)模拟的计算成本过高，限制了汽车设计与优化。而现有的机器学习代理模型尽管加速了预测，但并无单一架构能够展现普适性优势。

Method: 提出一种专家混合（MoE）框架，整合DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet和FigConvNet三种尖端代理模型，通过一个门控网络动态分配其局部预测权重，同时引入熵正则化项避免模型崩溃，并在DrivAerML数据集上进行全面训练和验证。

Result: 该方法显著降低了预测误差（L2），优于单一专家模型和直接集成平均值。

Conclusion: MoE框架通过整合不同神经架构的互补优势，提供了一种强大而有效的构建更稳健代理模型的策略，为CFD建模提供了新的领域方法。

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Relevance Patching (RelP)的新方法，通过使用层级相关传播(LRP)的传播系数来改进传统的归因修补(Attribution Patching)，从而实现更高的计算效率和忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Activation Patching方法尽管计算精度高，但在实际应用中代价昂贵；归因修补(Attribution Patching)虽然速度快，但却在深度非线性网络中表现不够可靠。需要一种既能提高计算效率又能保持精确性的解决方案。

Method: RelP通过将归因修补中的局部梯度替换为LRP导出的传播系数来改进计算流程，仅需两次前向传递和一次后向传递，兼顾了计算效率和模型解析忠实度。

Result: 实验表明RelP方法在多个模型和任务中都优于归因修补。例如在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中，对于MLP输出，归因修补的相关性仅为0.006，而RelP达到0.956。此外，RelP与集成梯度(IG)相比，在忠实度上相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: RelP为解释复杂神经网络提供了一种可靠且高效的工具，在忠实度和效率上实现了平衡，特别适合大规模模型的行为分析。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

TL;DR: 本文提出FedOwen框架，有效地通过Owen采样逼近Shapley值，并采用自适应的客户端选择策略，在固定评估成本内提升全局模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法高效计算参与者的Shapley值，而准确估计这些值对公平奖励及选择高效客户端至关重要。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，通过Owen采样近似计算Shapley值，同时使用自适应客户端选择策略，在评估预算内更好地分配资源。

Result: 在非独立同分布基准测试中，FedOwen在相同通信轮数下以固定评估成本达到了比最新方法高23%的最终准确率。

Conclusion: FedOwen在保障逼近误差低的同时，使大规模联邦学习场景中快速收敛成为可能，是一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

TL;DR: G&L v1.0提出了一种衡量机器学习模型冷启动适应性的框架，利用累积误差来分析模型从头学习过程中的表现差别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习模型评估主要关注最终的精度，而忽视了学习适应成本（如冷启动阶段的累计误差），G&L的动机是弥补这一分析缺口。

Method: 提出Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0框架，通过定义四种评估轨迹并结合经典的错误上限理论，对模型在在线或批量模式下的学习适应速度和错误轨迹进行测量和分析。

Result: 实验表明，较小的模型在早期阶段适应迅速，初始错误较少，而预训练的优点因领域而异。目前所有模型都远低于理想的适应性基准（oracle band）。

Conclusion: 通过计算不同模型早期学习中的错误代价，G&L补充了传统的性能基准，为研究更适应性的学习模型提供了可复现的方法框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的模型在面对概念漂移（即数据统计特性随时间改变）时性能大幅下降，因此需要一种适应性更强的实时异常检测方法。

Conclusion: CALM通过实时学习和大模型辅助，实现了动态数据流环境下高效的异常检测，并能应对数据模式的不断变化。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出MyGO，一个受生物觉醒-睡眠周期启发的终身学习框架，用于解决任务序列学习中的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在数据隐私、存储限制以及任务不相似性情况下的不足，发展一种无需存储原始数据的终身学习模型。

Method: 在“觉醒”阶段快速学习新任务并训练压缩生成模型G-mem；在“睡眠”阶段通过G-mem生成伪数据并结合知识蒸馏巩固新旧知识。

Result: 在计算机视觉(Split-MNIST)和自然语言处理(Split-AG News)基准测试中，相较于顺序微调基线，MyGO显著降低遗忘并保持高任务平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO有效缓解灾难性遗忘，证明了其跨领域实用性并且在隐私与存储上具备显著优势。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VILA的新型机器遗忘框架，更高效地消除模型敏感信息，同时提升了计算效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决LLMs生成含敏感信息输出的问题，并克服重新训练模型带来的高计算成本。

Method: VILA通过改进基于Fisher信息的参数识别方法，同时避免访问整个模型，显著提高了遗忘集参数识别的精确性与效率。

Result: VILA相比现有的FILA方法，提高了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度，在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准上取得了最新的性能状态。

Conclusion: VILA在保证性能的同时显著降低了计算开销，为高效实现机器遗忘提供了新思路，并成为领域内的最新标杆。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架去理解常用的Q学习增强学习算法的实际收敛性，并证明了基于一定技术条件可以收敛至正则化MDP的固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多Q学习算法在实际中表现出良好效果，但其理论收敛性尚不明确，因此需要研究其问题的核心原因及运行机制。

Method: 提出并分析了一种称为正则化基于代理状态的Q学习（RASQL）的算法，并研究了它在假设条件下的收敛性。同时，扩展了一种能够学习周期性策略的RASQL变体，进行理论证明和数值实验。

Result: 证明了RASQL算法在温和技术条件下收敛到与行为策略的平稳分布相关的正则化MDP的固定点，并验证了数值实验与理论预期相符。

Conclusion: 理论和实验都表明，基于代理状态且引入正则化的Q学习算法可以实现期望的收敛行为，进一步增强了对Q学习算法行为的理解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Sampled-SAE方法，通过对BatchTopK进行调整，结合全局和局部重构实现更灵活的激活选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决TopK SAE方法中不同token的信息承载不均以及BatchTopK方法中的激活偏置问题。

Method: 通过对batch激活矩阵的列评分，构造候选特征池，并在池内实施Top-K选择，从而在全局一致性和细粒度重构之间进行调节。

Result: 在Pythia-160M实验中，参数$l$的选择需根据共享结构、重构精度和下游表现之间的平衡进行权衡，未发现单一最优值。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE提供了一种可调整、分布感知的优化方法，可在全局和细粒度间灵活切换。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列生成任务因其涉及长程依赖和数据分布漂移的平衡，以及复杂的特征序列间关系捕捉而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出的Stage-Diff模型采用分阶段的序列生成和信息传递，结合渐进式序列分解和多通道融合建模，以平衡长期时间序列的依赖关系。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，Stage-Diff在长期时间序列生成任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过创新性的方法，解决了长期时间序列生成中的关键挑战，有效提升了生成质量与稳健性。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列生成方法难以保证生成结果的时间依赖性，并难以准确捕捉原时间序列的特征信息，因此需要改进。

Result: 实验表明，DLGAN在四个公开数据集上的测试中，在多个评价指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DLGAN通过创新的分阶段生成策略有效提升了时间序列生成的质量，能够更好地保持时间序列的特性。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应重尾随机梯度下降算法（AHTSGD），通过动态调整优化器噪声来加速广泛的收敛并改善泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受两大现象启发：1. 随机梯度下降中梯度噪声的重尾分布；2. 神经网络训练中的稳定性边缘现象，即曲率在稳定前增加。

Method: 提出一种优化算法AHTSGD，在训练初期加入重尾噪声以增强探索能力，在曲率稳定后逐渐转变为较轻尾噪声，动态适应损失景观的尖锐度。

Result: AHTSGD在MNIST、CIFAR-10等基准上表现优于传统SGD和其他基于噪声的方法，并显著提升了在噪声数据集（如SVHN）上的性能。

Conclusion: AHTSGD能加速从较差初始化开始的早期训练，改善干净和噪声环境下的泛化性能，对学习率选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Method: 通过扩展logit lens方法，分析Leela Chess Zero这一超人级国际象棋引擎的策略网络，用以研究其分层行为特征。

Result: 发现了分布非平滑迹象，包括早期正确解答被抛弃、动作排名与最终输出相关性低及策略偏差持续到网络后期。

Conclusion: 结果表明神经网络可能不像语言模型形成平滑的分布收敛，而是表现出更复杂的政策分布动态特性。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: CoM在多个基准测试上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过CoM方法，有效解决了合并过程中因内部协变量偏移所引起的分布失配问题，可实现更高质量的统一模型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Motivation: 传统RL方法注重于优化期望累计奖励的集合平均，但在实际应用中，单个轨迹的表现平均可能不具参考意义，因此提出优化单个轨迹长期表现的方法。

Method: 算法定义时间平均增长率的Bellman算子，并提出了一种基于乘法奖励动态的几何平均方法，以及一种结合了$N$滑动窗口的修正几何平均作为时间平均增长率的估计器，同时作为正则项嵌入目标函数。

Result: 算法在挑战性模拟中优于传统RL方法，证明其兼顾单个轨迹和总体表现的能力。

Conclusion: 所示方法为优化强化学习在单个轨迹和总体表现之间取得平衡提供了有效解决方案，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Result: 成功对双曲空间中的正态分布进行了Rm-NML的显式计算，证明了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 文章为在黎曼流形上的NML建立了理论框架，并开发了适用的方法，对分析这些非欧几里得空间的数据提供了新的工具。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Motivation: 早退出模型通常依赖基于置信度的退出策略，但存在计算浪费以及校准不能维持样本排序的问题。

Method: 通过实证展示误校准网络的优越性，并提议使用失败预测作为衡量早退出性能的新方法。

Result: 发现失败预测与效率改进关联更强，比常用校准方法更稳定可靠。

Conclusion: 用失败预测替代校准方法能更有效设计和评估早退出模型。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 作者提出Spiking Decision Transformer（SNN-DT），结合Transformer和尖峰神经网络（SNN），以实现能量高效的序列决策任务，兼具性能与低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的强化学习模型在序列决策任务中表现优异，但其高密度矩阵运算不适合能量受限或边缘计算环境。尖峰神经网络提供了超低能耗的事件驱动推理，但尚无将尖峰动力学与回报条件的序列建模无缝结合的研究。

Method: SNN-DT将Leaky Integrate-and-Fire神经元嵌入自注意力模块，通过代理梯度进行端到端训练，集成生物学启发的三因子可塑性、相位偏移的尖峰位置编码以及轻量化的树突路由模块。

Result: 在经典控制基准（CartPole-v1、MountainCar-v0、Acrobot-v1、Pendulum-v1）上，SNN-DT表现与标准Decision Transformer（DT）匹敌或超越，同时每次决策发出少于10次尖峰。这表明每次推理的能量需求减少了超过四个数量级。

Conclusion: SNN-DT结合序列建模和神经形态效率，为嵌入式和可穿戴设备上的实时低功耗控制提供了可能路线。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLMs在处理表格数据时的性能和公平性，尤其是在贷款审批场景中应用的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险决策任务中的应用不断扩大，但它们在处理表格数据时存在挑战，需要确保公平性和可靠性。

Method: 通过使用来自加纳、德国和美国的贷款审批数据集，研究LLMs在零样本学习和上下文学习情况下的表现。探讨不同序列化格式的影响。

Result: 序列化格式严重影响模型性能和公平性，其中GReat和LIFT格式性能较高，但可能加剧公平性问题；上下文学习显著提升了模型性能，但对公平性影响不一。

Conclusion: 需要有效的表格数据表示方法和关注公平性的模型设计，以改善LLMs在金融决策中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Motivation: 探究GNN在求解布尔可满足性问题中的性能瓶颈，特别是在面对复杂实例时表现迅速下降的现象背后可能的原因。

Method: 利用图Ricci曲率分析SAT问题的生成图及难度特性，并证明了复杂度增加与负曲率之间的联系，验证了过度压缩现象对GNN提出的限制。结合实验验证SAT复杂性的曲率指标和性能预测有效性。

Result: 表明图Ricci曲率可以用作问题复杂度的强指标，并有效预测GNN的性能表现；验证了过度压缩现象在负曲率图中的作用。

Conclusion: 发现了GNN在求解SAT问题上的架构局限与曲率特性之间的关联，为未来改进SAT求解算法提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 为回应数据最小化这一法律原则，在推荐系统中探索在保障性能的情况下减少隐式反馈数据的必要性和可行性。

Method: 提出全新问题定义，分析不同数据最小化技术，并研究技术环境和用户特征对数据最小化的影响。

Result: 发现大幅减少推断数据在技术上可行且不显著影响性能，但受模型目标及用户特性影响较大。

Conclusion: 数据最小化技术虽有可行性，但在实际应用中因技术和用户语境的不同存在很大挑战，难以统一标准。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Motivation: 旨在解决智能电网建模中数据稀缺和物理一致性的问题。

Method: 通过定义基于物理的损失函数（包括功率平衡、运行约束和电网稳定性），将PINNs与传统方法（如XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归）进行性能比较，并评估其在插值、交叉验证和轨迹预测中的能力。

Result: PINNs在动态电网操作中表现出更低的平均绝对误差（MAE），在随机和专家控制场景中可靠捕捉状态转换，而传统模型表现不稳定。尽管在极端操作条件下略有性能下降，PINNs仍能保持物理可行性。

Conclusion: PINNs作为智能电网代理建模工具展示出变革性潜力，为实时电网控制和数字孪生技术的发展提供了新思路，体现了物理感知架构在关键能源系统中的必要性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

### [167] [Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695)
*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的OOD检测方法（ActSub），利用分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，将模型激活分解为决定性和无关两个分量，从而在不同分布偏离下更有效地区分ID和OOD数据。在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决深度模型在实际应用中的可靠性问题，研究如何通过区分训练分布（ID）和分布偏移的数据（OOD）来提高模型的性能。

Method: 提出了一种新方法ActSub，通过对分类头的权重矩阵进行奇异值分解，将模型激活分解为决定性分量和无关分量，以更好地区分不同程度分布偏移下的ID和OOD数据。

Result: ActSub方法在大分布偏移（Far-OOD）下利用无关分量更好地区分ID和OOD数据，在小分布偏移（Near-OOD）中仅利用决定性分量避免干扰，且综合方法在多个标准OOD基准测试中实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: 利用奇异值分解和分量分析，可以有效提升OOD检测性能，不同分布偏移条件下需要分别对决定性分量和无关分量进行处理，从而实现对OOD数据的高效检测。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种适应传统LRDD到统计学习框架的新方法，集成了历史数据、动态协变量和外生变量，用于预测时间事件对社区心理健康的特定影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决单纯预测心理健康评分对事件影响解释力有限问题，需要利用准实验设计方法如LRDD以更因果的方式分析观察数据。

Method: 将LRDD扩展至统计学习框架，结合社区评分历史、动态协变量及外生变量来预测特定事件导致的心理健康“间断性”和“坡度”变化。

Result: 将方法应用于评估COVID-19对美国县级焦虑的影响，发现通过整合外生和动态协变量提升预测效果，精确度$r=0.46$（间断性）和$r=0.65$（坡度）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了传统社区表示法下的预测能力，提出了预测个别社区未来/假想事件影响的新可能性。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: LCLS-II 自由电子激光 (FEL) 会生成高达 1 MHz 的 X 射线脉冲，其检测器数据达 1 TB/s，通过机器学习实现实时数据减少以应对数据管理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 LCLS-II FEL 产生的大规模数据流挑战，降低传输与存储基础设施的成本，同时确保实时处理能力。

Method: 开发 SLAC 神经网络库 (SNL)，利用 FPGA 部署实时机器学习推理模型，并通过 Auto-SNL 轻松将 Python 神经网络转换为高效代码与 FPGA 集成。

Result: 与现有工具 hls4ml 比较，SNL 在大多数体系结构中达到相当甚至更优的延迟表现，并在某些情况下节省 FPGA 资源。

Conclusion: SNL 证明了其灵活性和优势，为研究人员在高能物理、医学成像和机器人等领域提供了新机会。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多标签排名方法UniMLR，综合考虑正标记间的排名关系，而非仅关注正负标记的划分，实验表明该方法在多个数据集上的表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标签排名框架中，未充分考虑正标记间的排名关系，仅利用正负标记的划分。而正标记之间的排名信息可能为多标签学习提供额外的价值。

Method: 提出UniMLR，将标签的隐式相关性/重要性值建模为概率分布，并引入8个合成数据集（Ranked MNISTs）以增强实验的控制和多样性。

Result: 通过统计和实验证明，UniMLR能够准确学习正标记的排名顺序，并在真实与合成数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: 考虑正标记间排名关系的UniMLR方法能够有效提升多标签排名任务的性能，为多标签学习带来新的视角。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新框架，通过处理设备和用户异质性，提高了心率预测的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心率预测在健康监测中至关重要，但实用性受制于数据异质性问题（设备和用户差异）。

Method: 通过随机特征丢弃策略处理设备异质性，用时间注意力模块和对比学习目标捕捉用户异质性，还新建了一个公开数据集ParroTao用于评估。

Result: 在ParroTao和公开FitRec数据集上分别比现有方法提升了17%和15%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在异质性数据场景下显著优于基线模型，且有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoE-Health的多模态融合框架，可适应不完整和异质的医疗数据，显著提高预测准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理医疗数据中的模态不完整性，限制了在真实世界医疗场景中的应用。

Method: 设计了一个包含专用专家网络和动态门控机制的MoE-Health框架，根据输入数据动态选择合适的专家进行预测。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三类关键任务中，MoE-Health表现优于现有多模态融合方法，并在不同模态可用性模式下表现出较高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoE-Health通过高效融合异质和不完整的医疗数据，为多样化的医疗环境提供了更为可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于QR分解的Low-Rank Adaptation方法（QR-LoRA），相比标准LoRA显著减少了训练参数，同时在GLUE任务中表现优于全参数微调和其他LoRA变种。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模的增长要求高效的参数微调技术，现有方法如LoRA虽有效但仍存在计算代价高的问题。

Method: 通过对预训练权重矩阵使用带列主元的QR分解提取正交基，再用这些基向量的线性组合表示LoRA更新，只训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务中，QR-LoRA性能优于全参数微调、标准LoRA及SVD-LoRA，仅需601个参数，相比全参数微调减少了超过1000倍，相比典型LoRA减少了77倍。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA展示了在极低参数情况下能达到甚至超越现有方法的性能，具有高效结构明确的特点。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FLIP，一种基于变分自编码器与潜在扩散技术的工具，用以在隐私和公平保障下生成异质表格数据，并解决隐私与公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐私法规（如GDPR和HIPAA）及人工智能责任框架（如AI Act）的兴起，限制了真实数据的使用，合成数据生成成为解决隐私与公平问题的可行方案。

Method: 通过使用变分自编码器（Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder）以及潜在扩散技术，并引入RDP隐私保障、RDP兼容的平衡采样和CKA神经元对齐方法，实现公平的表格数据生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，FLIP显著提高了无任务依赖的公平性，并在多种下游任务中体现了有效的隐私与公平保障。

Conclusion: FLIP在不依赖具体任务的前提下为隐私和公平的表格数据生成提供了一种通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.
