Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一种独立的自回归模型，专注于高质量图像生成，在灵活性和多任务能力上表现优秀，与最先进扩散模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望在现有扩散模型的基础上，探索并重新定义自回归高质量图像生成的潜力。

Method: 完全从零开始训练无预训练的解码自回归模型；使用统一标记化方法处理多种任务；引入高效推理技术如推断时缩放和Jacobi采样。

Result: 在文本到图像任务中达到或超越了当前扩散模型性能；在多任务数据集上（如Graph200K）表现出色。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是强大的基础模型，不仅灵活还能完成多模态生成任务，具有广泛应用潜力。例如代码和模型已开放分享。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种轻量化视频理解模型SV3.3B，用于提升运动视频分析的效率和精度，同时降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前自动化运动视频分析受制于计算要求高的服务器端模型，并且缺少对运动细节的深入理解。本研究旨在开发高效的轻量化模型，改善动作描述的精细度和准确性，同时实现设备端处理。

Method: 提出一种名为SV3.3B的3.3B参数模型，结合新颖的时间运动差分采样和V-DWT-JEPA2编码器，使用自监督学习实现轻量化处理。此外，通过DWT-VGG16-LDA机制选取关键帧并结合LLM解码器进行动作描述生成。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集子集上的实验表明，SV3.3B在传统文本生成指标和运动评估标准上均优于包括GPT-4o在内的更大规模模型，同时显著降低了计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: SV3.3B模型实现了技术性强且富有分析价值的运动描述，在保障高效运行的同时，改善了信息密度、动作复杂性及测量精确性，适用于设备端运动视频分析。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Detail++的新框架，通过逐步注入细节（PDI）策略来改进文本到图像生成，特别针对复杂提示词中的多对象生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成技术在处理复杂提示词及多主体的区分上存在局限性，灵感来源于模仿人类绘画过程。

Method: 无需重新训练，通过逐步细化生成策略，将复杂提示分解为简单子提示，逐阶段生成，并通过Centroid Alignment Loss在测试时提升属性一致性。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新风格组合基准测试中表现优异，尤其在多对象和复杂风格条件下超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Detail++框架无需重新训练，有效解决复杂提示多主体生成问题，极大提升了文本到图像生成的效果和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M 是一项新的统一基准，用于在复杂水下场景中进行鱼类检测，与 13 个公开数据集整合以提供一致和可扩展的跨领域评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测在生态监测、水产养殖自动化和机器人感知中至关重要，但存在数据集分散、成像条件多样化等问题。研究旨在通过 FishDet-M 解决这些限制，统一基准并简化评价。

Method: 整合 13 个数据集并以 COCO 标注标准化，测试了包括 YOLO 系列、R-CNN 和 DETR 在内的 28 个模型，用于一致性评价和效率分析。此外，还引入基于 CLIP 的动态模型选择框架，实现零样本检测。

Result: 分析表明，不同模型在精度和效率上的表现存在差异。CLIP 框架提高了检测的适应性，且无需计算集合，在实时应用中可扩展。

Conclusion: FishDet-M 提供了一种标准化平台，用于评估水下场景中的目标检测，将推进智能海洋系统和相关领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨利用生成式人工智能评估皮肤癌分类器的公平性，重点在于确保数据集的多样性和代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度学习在皮肤癌筛查中的应用潜力巨大，但存在潜在的偏见问题，因此需要评估并改进这些系统的公平性。

Method: 采用尖端生成式人工智能LightningDiT模型，通过生成高仿真合成数据评估公开的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 发现基于高度仿真的合成数据进行公平性评估具有潜力，但如果使用的分类模型训练数据与评估数据不同，验证公平性将变得困难。

Conclusion: 提出使用合成数据评估和改进医疗影像系统公平性的新途径，尽管效果受训练数据相异性的限制。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的图像恢复方法（DiNAT-IR），通过结合局部和全局注意力机制，实现多项基准测试中的高质量图像恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的图像恢复方法虽然有效，但由于自注意力机制的高计算成本和局部注意力对全局上下文理解的限制，其在高分辨率图像上的扩展性和恢复精准度受到较大限制。

Method: 作者提出了Dilated Neighborhood Attention（DiNA），结合滑动窗口注意力及混合扩张因子，平衡了全局上下文和局部精度，并引入了一个通道感知模块来优化局部与全局信息的整合。最终设计了针对图像恢复任务的DiNAT-IR架构。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试上取得了具竞争力的效果，展现了其在多种低层次视觉任务中的适用性。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR通过优化全局上下文和像素级精度之间的关系，为图像恢复问题提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种适用于无监督领域自适应语义分割的新模块Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR)，通过整合上下文和细粒度特征提高分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法难以平衡局部细节与全局信息，导致复杂区域分割错误。

Method: 通过引入AFR模块，利用低分辨率语义先验精炼高分辨率特征，同时整合高频成分以增强边界信息，使用基于不确定性的注意力机制在局部与全局信息间调整，且设计轻量化便于集成。

Result: 实现了一种在UDA方法中“无缝集成”的改进，将GTA V到Cityscapes任务的mIoU提升1.05%，Synthia到Cityscapes任务提升1.04%。

Conclusion: AFR模块能够提高现有UDA-SS方法的性能，实现领域自适应语义分割的最新技术水平。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在虚拟环境中，尤其是在线教育和虚拟康复中如何有效衡量参与度。作者开发了一个名为OPEN的新数据集，特别关注老年人的虚拟学习参与。研究通过AI模型验证，参与识别准确性高达81%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟学习中参与度是提高满意度和表现的关键，但在虚拟群体中准确测量仍是挑战，尤其针对老年人群体。

Method: 构建了一个名为OPEN的数据集，包含老年患者虚拟学习参与的标注数据，同时使用多种机器学习与深度学习模型进行实验并衡量准确性。

Result: 在超过35小时数据的实验中，参与识别的准确率高达81%，显示了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: OPEN数据集为老年人群参与个性化建模提供了坚实基础，并对更广泛的参与识别领域有所贡献。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种使用YOLO模型的自动化视频分析系统，用于实时检测鬃狮蜥的晒太阳和捕猎行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鬃狮蜥行为监测耗时并易出错，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 使用YOLO模型对1200张图像的自定义数据集进行训练，识别鬃狮蜥、加热灯和蟋蟀，通过规则逻辑分类行为，选取YOLOv8s作为最佳模型。

Result: 晒太阳行为检测效果可靠，但捕猎行为检测因蟋蟀检测较弱（mAP@0.5=0.392）效果欠佳。

Conclusion: 该系统提高了研究效率和数据质量，未来将改进蟋蟀检测以提高表现。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个空地跨模态视频行人重识别数据集AG-VPReID.VIR，以及一种针对空地RGB与红外模态差异的新型三流架构TCC-VPReID。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行人重识别研究多聚焦于地面视角，而地面红外系统在夜间监控中易受遮挡与覆盖范围限制。本研究旨在解决此类局限性，探索空中视角在24小时监控中的潜力。

Method: 构建了跨空地和模态数据的AG-VPReID.VIR数据集，并提出TCC-VPReID框架，通过风格鲁棒特征学习、基于记忆的视角适应及中介引导的时间建模方法，应对模态不一致与视角差异。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AG-VPReID.VIR数据集与TCC-VPReID框架为跨空地视角与RGB-IR模态行人重识别提供了新的解决方案，并展现了优异的效果。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨标签偏差对医疗成像AI系统中亚组公平性的影响，发现偏差会显著改变模型学习的特征表示并影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在医疗成像数据中标签偏差对亚组公平性及模型表现的影响，这是一个尚未充分研究的问题。

Method: 使用EMBED数据集，通过模拟测试机器学习模型在分离亚组和伪分离亚组（基于成像制造商）的标签偏差对模型学习特征和性能的影响。

Result: 发现亚组标签偏差显著改变了模型的特征表示，这种变化依赖于亚组大小和可分性，并在性能评估中体现了偏差对不同亚组的差异性影响。

Conclusion: 强调了医疗影像AI中标签偏差对亚组公平性和模型表现的潜在影响，并指出需要更加关注标签偏差问题。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种方法，首次将可优化的距离函数应用于Grassmann流形，用于刚体变换下两Grassmann特征之间的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能够测量Grassmann线性子空间之间的接近性，但无法给出刚体变换明确的距离函数，这限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过严格的数学推导，展示高维线性子空间的基可以作为显式的优化代价函数，并基于此提出了一种可优化的代价函数，用于任何仿射子空间的配准问题。

Result: 新方法无需关注表示歧义，直接最小化测地线距离，能够找到全局最优解。且在多种计算机视觉任务中具有更好的收敛性或性能。

Conclusion: 本文方法通过提出显式优化的代价函数，不仅改进了现有解决方案，还推动了Grassmann流形在计算机视觉任务中的应用价值。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

*Jake R. Patock,Nicole Catherine Lewis,Kevin McCoy,Christina Gomez,Canling Chen,Lorenzo Luzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入改进的GRR-CoCa模型，通过整合多种先进技术，提升视觉-语言任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态生成模型在架构上落后于大型语言模型 (LLMs)，需要引入新的方法以提升性能。

Method: 提出GRR-CoCa，修改现有CoCa模型，整合了Gaussian误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入，以改进文本解码器和视觉编码器。

Result: 相比Baseline CoCa，GRR-CoCa在预训练和微调任务上显著提升了表现，例如对比损失下降27.25%、困惑度改善3.71%、CoCa损失改善7.15%等。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa架构的改进对视觉-语言领域的任务表现和泛化能力有显著提升作用。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

TL;DR: 本研究推出了一个新的视频DeepFake基准数据集Celeb-DF++，旨在应对检测多种类型的DeepFake挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在线传播的DeepFake视频种类日益多样化，现有数据集无法满足开发广泛适用的检测模型需求。

Method: 扩展原有的Celeb-DF数据集，构建了包含面部交换、面部重现和说话人合成三种类型、采用22种不同生成方法的视频数据集。

Result: 通过引入Celeb-DF++对24种检测方法的广泛性进行评估，证明现有方法存在明显局限性。

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++为泛化性法医挑战提供了一个格外丰富和高难度的基准，具有重要的研究价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种创新的3D高斯修复框架，通过稀疏修复的视图重建完整的3D场景，克服了传统方法在多视图一致性和细节保真度上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视图3D重建技术（如NeRF和3DGS）虽然提升了3D内容创建的精度和效率，但在面对3D场景修复时，由于3D结构的不规则性和多视图一致性难题，仍面临较大挑战。

Method: 提出了一种3D Gaussian修复框架，包括自动化的掩模精炼过程和基于区域的不确定性引导优化方法。掩模精炼涉及高斯场景过滤和反向投影等操作，不确定性引导在训练中评估多视图图像中各个区域的重要性，以提升一致性和细节还原。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和视图一致性方面优于现有的最新方法。

Conclusion: 该工作在3D场景修复领域引入了一种新颖的策略，通过结合自动化精炼和不确定性引导优化，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为高质量、多视图一致性修复奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: ViGText结合视觉大语言模型解释文本与图像，以图神经网络提高deepfake检测性能，实验表明其在通用性和鲁棒性上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: deepfake技术的快速发展威胁媒体真实性，传统方法在应对复杂和定制化deepfake上存在局限。

Method: 提出ViGText，将视觉大语言模型生成的文本与图像数据整合至图神经网络框架中，通过空间和频域的多层特征提取实现deepfake检测。

Result: 实验表明，ViGText在平均F1分数上从72.45%提升至98.32%，在判断定制化deepfake上显示出优越性，鲁棒性召回率提升11.1%，并将目标攻击下的性能衰减限制在4%以内。

Conclusion: ViGText通过更详细的视觉和文本分析提升了deepfake检测水平，为媒体真实性保障提供了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Transition-Aware Video (TAV) 数据集以改进现有的AI视频生成对于多场景过渡性的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI视频生成模型在生成包含多场景的长视频时存在困难，尤其是难以理解多场景过渡的需求，主要源于训练数据集的限制。

Method: 提供一个名为Transition-Aware Video (TAV) 的数据集，该数据集包含了具有多场景过渡的视频剪辑，并利用这些数据对模型进行后续训练。

Result: 实验表明，基于TAV数据集的后训练可以有效提升对提示中场景过渡的理解能力，同时保持图像质量，并缩小生成场景与提示需求之间的差距。

Conclusion: TAV数据集能够显著提高AI模型对多场景视频生成中场景过渡的感知能力，为解决文本到多场景视频生成问题提供了方法支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在深度不连续性处产生伪影的问题，提升镜头模糊渲染的真实性和视觉效果。

Method: 采用基于物理的自注意力模块，结合深度相关模糊约束和自遮挡效应，并调整扩散模型为一步推理方案，同时利用扩散模型生成真实感前景数据。

Result: 达到了高质量、高保真的渲染效果，克服了深度估计误差带来的问题。

Conclusion: BokehDiff 提供了一种物理精确和视觉上优越的镜头模糊渲染方法，提升了真实感和场景多样性。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法忽略了来自正常光图像的语义指导，因此在复杂光照条件下效果受限。

Method: 提出VLM-IMI框架，结合视觉语言模型与迭代和人工指导，并引入指令先验融合模块，用于动态对齐和融合图像与文本特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，VLM-IMI在多种场景中优于现有方法，在定量指标和感知质量上表现更佳。

Conclusion: VLM-IMI通过引入语义指导和迭代指导策略，显著改进了低光图像增强的效果，提升了结构保真度、语义一致性和细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的文本驱动方法TextSAM-EUS，结合医疗图像分割模型SAM和文本提示学习，用于实现胰腺癌EUS图像的高效自动分割，在公开数据集中取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌有着较差的预后，EUS虽然是关键的诊疗工具，但其噪点和低对比度图像等问题使得传统深度学习模型的分割精度受限，并且依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 利用BiomedCLIP文本编码器进行文本提示学习（context optimization），结合基于LoRA的SAM架构适配，可在仅调节0.86%参数的情况下，实现无需手动几何提示的自动肿瘤分割。

Result: 在公开的胰腺EUS数据库上，TextSAM-EUS在自动提示下达到82.69%的Dice得分和85.28%的NSD，在手动几何提示下达到83.10%的Dice和85.70%的NSD，超过现有的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS作为首次结合提示学习的SAM医疗图像分割方法，为胰腺癌EUS图像的高效、鲁棒自动分割提供了实践解决方案。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HDF利用DAM和DSM模块有效解决动态面部表情识别中的异质性问题，实现了当前显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Motivation: 为了解决如何通过多模态的自然电影编码预测全脑fMRI反应的问题，并回答如何在不同被试者结构间取得平衡的科学问题。

Method: 模型应用序列到序列的Transformer架构，使用了包括VideoMAE、HuBERT等的预训练模型提取刺激特征，同时结合从脑状态、当前刺激和情景总结中获取的信息，通过双重交叉注意机制进行建模。特别地，提出了多模态上下文序列对脑活动序列预测以及共享编码器结合部分被试特异性解码的创新方法。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分布外样本检测中未能同时考虑模型和数据的不确定性，难以满足语义目标。

Method: 提出了一种基于自由能的后验网络，包括利用Beta分布的密度估计器来估计精细的不确定性，以及无需随机抽样的直接不确定性估计损失函数。

Result: 在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly等真实世界基准测试中验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在OoD检测中实现了语义上有意义且计算高效的不确定性感知分割。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息熵的曲线扭曲度量框架，并证明其在评估睑板腺萎缩的均匀性时具有高效性。

Motivation: 当前医学图像分析需要更准确的曲线扭曲度量方式以辅助诊断及评估病理，现有方法存在应用局限性。

Method: 采用信息熵为基础的框架，将概率建模与熵理论相结合，并使用曲线数据的域变换；该方法通过指定参考曲线对目标曲线的扭曲度进行评估。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了方法的稳定性及有效性，并在睑板腺萎缩均匀性量化中发现Demodex阳性与阴性患者组存在显著性差异，AUC为0.8768，灵敏度为0.75，特异度为0.93。

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: 通过双向建模和对特征交互与校正模块的设计，该方法在低光图像增强任务中表现出众，生成的图像更符合人类视觉感知。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Motivation: 利用RGB和IR图像的互补特性来提升目标检测效果，但目前存在信息融合不足的问题。

Method: 采用离散小波变换(DWT)对RGB和IR图像进行频率分解，通过WaveMamba Fusion Block（WMFB）实现频率子带的全面交叉融合，并改进检测头引入反离散小波变换(IDWT)以减少信息丢失。

Result: 该方法在四个基准上实现了显著性能提升，平均mAP提高了4.5%。

Conclusion: 提出方法有效提升了多模态目标检测性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于传感器类型或地理位置引起的领域迁移问题导致自动驾驶系统3D LiDAR语义分割性能下降，同时避免人工标注目标数据的高昂成本。

Method: 先通过基于片段的无监督对比学习预训练网络，学习强健的领域不变特征；随后采用多模型伪标签策略聚合当前最先进架构的预测结果，并通过强投票机制生成高质量伪标签，再对预训练网络进行微调。

Result: 在从SemanticKITTI到无标签目标数据集（例如SemanticPOSS、SemanticSlamantic）的迁移实验中，与直接迁移和单模型UDA方法相比，显著提升了分割准确率。

Conclusion: 结合基于对比学习的预训练和精炼的伪标签策略，能有效弥合复杂领域差异，并且无需目标领域的注释。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在数据稀缺情况下容易过拟合噪声和不相关模式，导致泛化能力弱。本文旨在克服这一挑战，尤其是针对医学图像分割任务。

Method: 提出了Diff-UMamba架构，结合UNet框架和mamba机制，并引入噪声抑制模块（NRM），通过信号差分策略在编码器中抑制噪声和无关的激活信号，从而提升模型对关键特征的关注。

Result: 在多个公共数据集（如MSD和AIIB23）上验证，Diff-UMamba在多种分割任务中相比基线方法性能提升了1%-3%。在BraTS-21数据集上通过调整训练样本比例评估了数据稀缺下的表现。此外，对NSCLC内部数据集的评估表明，GTV分割任务的性能比基线提高了4%-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在低数据情况下表现出更高的分割精度和鲁棒性，尤其在医学图像分割任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL引入了门控特征融合，用于小规模、无标签数据预训练，并在多个基准数据集上微调，显著提升了金属材料显微结构分析的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金属显微结构分析方法依赖监督学习，需要大量有标签数据，处理小样本时效果不一致。MatSSL旨在利用无标签数据克服这一局限。

Method: MatSSL首先在一个小规模无标签数据集中进行自监督预训练，然后在多个基准数据集上微调。采用门控特征融合技术，将多层次表示有效整合到模型中。

Result: 通过MetalDAM基准测试，MatSSL的mIoU达到了69.13%，优于ImageNet预训练模型的66.73%。在EBC数据集上表现出近40%的平均mIoU提升。

Conclusion: MatSSL有效利用了小规模无标签数据，保留了从大规模自然图片预训练中学到的丰富迁移特征，实现了在金相领域的有效适配。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Conclusion: TeEFusion方法成功在确保生成质量的前提下大幅提升了推理效率，为文本到图像生成领域提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Result: 提升了多种不同疾病类型分割数据集上的原始扩散模型性能。

Conclusion: 不改变模型架构、不增加推断阶段的参数或计算量，实现高效医学图像分割效果提升。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

Motivation: 现有的测试时域适应（TTA）方法在3D点云领域应用受限，因其空间领域优化计算量大且可能需要额外的训练数据。

Method: 提出一种基于图谱域的测试时域适应方法GSDTTA，将目标域的点云表示为离群值感知图，用图傅里叶变换（GFT）转化至图谱域，仅优化最低10%频率分量，并通过逆图傅里叶变换（IGFT）重建经过适应的点云。同时引入了一种以特征映射为指导的自训练策略，迭代优化频谱调整和模型参数。

Conclusion: GSDTTA是一种高效的3D点云测试时域适应方法，可捕获全局结构特性，以较少的参数实现准确适应。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Conclusion: 在数据受限情况下，GARL方法展现出卓越能力，可有效提高红外小目标检测系统的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 研究发现牙齿龋齿与肺癌特别是鳞状细胞肺癌存在显著正向因果关系，而牙周病则没有发现因果关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨口腔疾病（牙龋、牙周病）与肺癌之间的因果关系，并评估肺功能是否起到了中介作用。

Method: 通过两样本孟德尔随机化分析，利用大规模基因组关联研究数据，分析牙龋、牙周病与肺癌亚型之间的因果关系；采用反向方差加权法作为主要分析方法，并使用delta方法评估肺功能的中介作用。

Result: 发现牙齿龋齿显著增加肺癌（特别是鳞状细胞肺癌）风险，部分由肺功能（FVC和FEV1的下降）中介；但牙周病没有与肺癌存在因果关系。

Conclusion: 牙龋可能通过降低肺功能促进肺癌风险，建议将口腔护理与肺功能监测纳入癌症预防策略。

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Conclusion: 大规模多模态模型可以在无需额外检测模块的情况下，无缝应用于目标检测任务，LMM-Det提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LVLMs在科学领域中的应用和对复杂数据的解析能力尚未深入研究，该研究旨在填补这一空白，提升LVLMs对科学领域特殊数据的表现。

Method: 提出FieldLVLM框架，包括领域感知的语言生成策略和数据压缩多模态模型调优两部分。通过生成结构化的文本数据集和使用数据压缩技术优化模型，使模型更有效地学习科学数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，FieldLVLM在新提出的基准数据集上的表现显著优于现有方法，能够更好地处理科学领域复杂场数据。

Conclusion: FieldLVLM为科学研究中的大模型应用带来了新可能性，缩短了大规模模型与特定领域间发现的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Motivation: ECG波形的分割对临床诊断至关重要，但因缺乏公开标注的数据集，进展受到限制。该研究利用丰富的未标注数据，通过半监督学习来解决此问题。

Method: 整理并统一多个数据集，采用五种计算机视觉领域的半监督算法，在卷积网络和Transformer架构上分别进行实验，并设计了ECG特定的训练配置和增强策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，Transformer在半监督ECG分割中的表现优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 本文所提供的基准和统一框架将推动半监督ECG分割方法的发展，并促进领域研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的修正核范数（MNN）框架，用于矩阵恢复问题，具有同时捕获局部和全局信息的能力，并提供了理论上的恢复保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要侧重于数据的全局低秩结构，但未能有效结合局部信息，且参数调节复杂。这促使研究人员提出了MNN框架。

Method: MNN通过对适当的变换矩阵进行核范数操作，结合局部信息和全局低秩性，此外，证明该框架在较温和假设下可提供理论恢复保证。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，MNN在鲁棒PCA和矩阵补全任务中展现出了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: MNN框架灵活通用，结合局部与全局信息，能有效提升低秩矩阵恢复的表现，同时具备理论支持。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Conclusion: 通过新的数据集和模型方法，研究促进了对凝结尾迹形成、动态及气候影响的验证和更加精确的评估，为减少航空非二氧化碳影响提供了科学基础。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为SGCDet的创新型多视角室内3D目标检测框架，其核心在于基于自适应3D体素构建方式优化体素特征表示和计算效率，并取得了领域内的领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D物体检测方法大多限制体素的感受野在图像的固定位置，缺乏对几何和上下文信息的有效整合，因此亟需一种能够提升体素特征表示能力并提高计算效率的新方法。

Method: 在方法上，研究提出了一个几何与上下文感知的聚合模块以自适应构造体素特征，并设计了一种稀疏体素构建策略，通过挑选高占据概率的体素进行特征优化，减少自由空间中的冗余计算，从而提升整体效率。此外，方法仅依赖于3D边界框进行监督，无需场景几何的真值。

Result: 实验结果表明，SGCDet在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上均实现了当前最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过将几何与上下文信息自适应引入体素特征的表示中，同时减少冗余计算，该方法有效提升了室内3D物体检测的精度与效率，展示了优秀的实用性与优越性，并公开了源码以供研究者使用。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中的分类表现不佳，研究实验假设通过鸟鸣音调模式的可视化可以提高分类性能。

Method: 使用频谱图图像的深度学习模型，并通过添加频率上色来增强同类之间的区分能力。

Result: 新方法在相较未上色模型和BirdCLEF 2024冠军模型时，F1分数提升7.3%，ROC-AUC提升6.2%，CMAP提升6.6%。

Conclusion: 通过将频率信息融入频谱图的上色方法显著提高了鸟类鸣叫分类模型的性能，这验证了融合频率信息的有效性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various

development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Conclusion: 新提出的可变形卷积模块适用于多种复杂全局自相似特征的视觉任务，具有通用性，可拓展至更广泛的机器视觉应用。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Conclusion: MVG4D提供了一种高效且可控的从单一输入生成4D内容的方法，为沉浸式AR/VR体验开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

### [56] [SynC: Synthetic Image Caption Dataset Refinement with One-to-many Mapping for Zero-shot Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18616)
*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为SynC的新框架，通过将图像与语义对齐的方式优化生成的图像和描述对数据集，用以提升零样本图像描述的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前零样本图像描述通常利用生成模型生成合成数据集，但这些生成的图像与其输入描述语义常常不一致，导致数据噪声并影响模型训练。此前的方法主要针对文本数据的噪声清理，无法有效处理合成图像中语义失配的问题。

Method: 提出SynC框架，通过为每个描述从生成图像池中检索多个相关候选图像，并采用基于循环一致性的方法对齐图像和描述的语义，从而选出最佳图像。

Result: SynC显著提升了多种零样本图像描述模型在多个基准测试（如MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps）上的性能，并在多个场景中达到了最新最优的结果。

Conclusion: SynC提供了一种有效的策略来优化合成数据，用于提升零样本图像描述模型的表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HumanMaterial的模型及其基于渐进式训练的策略，通过OpenHumanBRDF数据集和一种新的CPR损失函数，在全身人类逆向渲染中实现了材料估计SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逆向渲染方法由于受限于简单材质数据和渲染公式，尤其是对于皮肤的材质渲染，结果真实感有限，需要解决材料估计中数据约束不足的问题。

Method: 构建高质量的数据集OpenHumanBRDF，包括法线、漫反射反照率、粗糙度等多种材料图，并设计HumanMaterial模型以渐进式训练方式结合CPR损失函数优化多种材料的估计。

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和实际数据上，实验表明新方法在材料估计方面达到了最新性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过提升材料数据质量和引入创新训练方法，有效改善了逆向渲染中的材料估计性能，尤其是皮肤材质的真实感。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的无位置嵌入层次化视觉Transformer（Iwin Transformer），通过创新的交错窗口注意力和深度可分离卷积直接从低分辨率调优至高分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有Swin Transformer需要连续两个模块来逼近全局注意力的局限，旨在探索更高效的全局信息交换方法。

Method: 采用交错窗口注意力机制结合深度可分离卷积，实现单一模块内的全局信息交换，无需两连续模块。

Result: 在图像分类（ImageNet-1K上的87.4 top-1准确率）、语义分割和视频动作识别等任务上表现出较强竞争力，并验证了其核心组件在类条件图像生成中的替换效果。

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer展示了其在视觉任务中的性能潜力，能激发未来更多的研究，如Iwin 3D Attention在视频生成中的应用。

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

TL;DR: 本文提出DCFFSNet网络，通过创新特征空间解耦策略和多尺度特征动态融合实现优于现有方法的医学图像分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度网络在医学图像分割中引入拓扑连通性时，存在强制注入特征模块、无法量化不同特征强度的问题。

Method: 设计了DCFFSNet，采用特征空间解耦策略和深度连通特征融合-分离架构，动态平衡多尺度特征表达。

Result: 实验表明，DCFFSNet在ISIC2018、DSB2018、MoNuSeg数据集中均优于现有方法，在Dice与IoU指标上取得明显提升。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet在医学图像分割中解决了分割碎片化问题，实现平滑边缘过渡，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的V-JEPA框架用于超声视频数据的分割，结合了新颖的3D本地化任务，在有限标注数据的情况下显著提高了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超声成像中，由于低对比度、高噪声以及伪影，获取和标注大规模数据集极具挑战性。因此，利用无标签数据进行有效表示学习的自监督学习（SSL）成为一种解决方案，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下可提升分割性能。

Method: 采用V-JEPA框架作为基础，对ViT模型进行预训练时提出了一个新颖的3D本地化辅助任务以增强本地性理解，从而克服ViT在小型医疗数据集上的表现不足。

Result: 通过设计的3D本地化任务，与V-JEPA结合，在使用全部标注数据时分割性能提升达3.4%，而在仅使用10%标注数据时提升达8.35%。

Conclusion: 引入的V-JEPA框架结合3D本地化任务显著增强了超声视频分割性能，验证了其在有限标注数据情况下的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非线性流形学习的深度学习方法（NLML-HPE）用于头部姿态估计，兼顾有限训练数据和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部姿态估计在多种计算机视觉应用中具有重要作用，但现有数据集通常存在姿态标注不准确的问题。

Method: 采用泰克分解与前馈神经网络的结合，将头部姿态估计建模为回归问题，并生成精确的2D姿态数据集以解决标注偏差问题。

Result: 在低训练数据的条件下实现了实时准确的头部姿态预测，充分捕获物体旋转性质。

Conclusion: NLML-HPE方法对头部姿态估计提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，特别适合有限数据的场景，代码与模型已公开。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法既增强了系统的鲁棒性又提升了计算效率，为全球检索解决方案提供了更优的性能表现。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PDB-Eval基准，用于个性化驾驶行为的详细理解以及使大型多模态模型（MLLMs）与驾驶理解和推理对齐。此基准包括PDB-X和PDB-QA两部分，分别评估MLLMs对驾驶场景的理解和用于视觉解释的问答任务。通过在这一基准下微调，显著提升了MLLMs在驾驶相关任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过理解驾驶员行为和意图，能够进行潜在风险评估及早期事故预防，同时为个性化驾驶辅助系统提供支持，提高其实际效用。然而，目前数据集在基于外部视觉证据解释一般车辆运动方面有限。

Method: 引入PDB-Eval基准，包括评估驾驶场景的PDB-X和视觉问答任务PDB-QA，以此扩展大型多模态模型在驾驶领域的推理能力。同时，通过微调使这些模型能够从更精细的描述中学习并改进驾驶相关任务表现。

Result: 在对基准的评估中，微调使MLLMs在零样本问答任务中性能提升高达73.2%，在Brain4Cars的意图预测任务中转向意图预测性能提高12.5%，在AIDE的所有任务上提升高达11%。

Conclusion: PDB-Eval基准通过有效桥接大型多模态模型与驾驶领域需求之间的差距，为提高个性化驾驶行为理解及驾驶分推能力提供了新的研究方向与工具支持。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LiDAR 3D目标检测的对抗性研究大多是数字攻击，缺乏物理可实现性，限制了其实用性。而物理对抗性攻击的研究仍然较少，且因设置和硬件差异导致再现性差。

Method: 提出了一个设备不可知的标准化框架，通过抽象物理对抗性攻击的关键元素，支持多种方法，并提供开源代码和基准测试协议，同时验证了仿真到物理环境的攻击转移效果。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅促进了对物理对抗性攻击的研究，还揭示了影响攻击成功的关键因素，能够提升对真实世界LiDAR感知系统的对抗性鲁棒性理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线生成高精度地图的方法存在可靠性问题，同时研究表明将不确定性纳入轨迹预测任务具有潜力提升表现，因此需要明确在哪些场景下不确定性有利并开发相关技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 开发一种结合语义知识与人工中心视机制的模型，以模仿人类在视觉搜索任务中的注意路径。

Method: 使用深度对象检测和概率语义融合机制，对注意力地图进行动态生成，并结合人工中心视区域调整方法，逐步更新模型输入以改进逐次注视点的预测。

Conclusion: 框架验证了语义-中心视概率模型在实现类人注意力建模中的优势，为实时认知计算和机器人学任务提供了潜在价值。

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc通过多模态融合的稳健性和高斯表示的效率，大幅提升了3D语义占用预测在精度和存储效率方面的表现。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 当前的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在空间和时间理解上各有优势，但难以实现基于指令的细粒度时空控制，因此开发新方法填补这一空白。

Method: 提出IntentVCNet，包括提示组合策略和高效参数的Box Adapter方法，结合用户意图建模和视觉语义信息增强，从而提升LVLM的时空细节建模能力。

Conclusion: 本方法通过结合用户意图和视觉语义增强，有效改善了LVLM在视频字幕生成任务中的时空控制能力，成为该领域的领先技术。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Conclusion: EDA模型解决了 EDM 中的噪声模式限制问题，实现了更高效的多任务图像修复，展示了其在多种复杂噪声模型下的潜力。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Method: 提出一个整合预训练MVS先验与概率Procrustes映射策略的新框架，通过子集划分和闭式概率对准方法优化全局点云与相机姿态，同时与3DGS联合优化。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实验结果表明，该方法在未配准图像序列中实现了高精度重建，并创造了新的未配准3DGS重建技术标准。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的未配准3DGS框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，并具备高效的点云与相机姿态优化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅可解释性强，无需手动初始化，并且对iUS视野变化具有较强的鲁棒性，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法难以实现对特定元素的修改和控制，并且在应对复杂的空间和语义约束方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于领域特定语言ScenethesisLang的3D软件合成方法，通过分阶段操作实现需求的逐步细化，同时保持与用户需求的形式化可追溯性。

Result: Scenethesis能够捕获80%以上的用户需求，满足90%以上的硬约束，并在BLIP-2视觉评估得分上比当前最先进方法提高42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis展现了在复杂3D软件生成中的巨大潜力，可有效平衡灵活性与约束满足能力，为未来类似的生成任务提供了范例。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 当前去混成方法存在复制问题，且依赖于相同的混成技术，限制了其实际应用的有效性。

Method: 提出的方法在潜在空间中分解混成人脸图像，使其能够处理未知的混成技术和人脸风格，训练使用合成脸，测试使用真实脸，采用不依赖于特定技术的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法克服了现有去混成方法中的主要问题，为检测和分析面部混成攻击提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本描述的零样本领域适应方法难以捕捉复杂真实世界的变化，并且对齐过程增加了适应时间，因此需要探索更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SIDA方法，生成合成图像并利用其样式特征作为目标领域的代理。设计了Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块，通过多样化样式增强领域表示能力。

Result: SIDA方法在多个零样本领域适应场景中表现出色，尤其在具有挑战性的领域，并显著降低了适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA结合合成图像和新颖模块，实现了高效且性能卓越的零样本领域适应，解决了基于文本描述方法存在的问题。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM)的新框架，利用对抗方式改进分数蒸馏（score distillation）技术，显著提升了单步和多步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布匹配蒸馏技术（如DMD）因依赖于反向KL散度最小化，可能会引发模式塌陷问题。为解决这一问题，作者提出了ADM框架，通过对抗方式进行分布匹配。

Method: ADM通过引入基于扩散模型的判别器，以对抗方式在真实与伪造的分数估计器之间对齐预测分布。同时，结合在潜在空间和像素空间的混合判别器进行对抗蒸馏，并采用ODE对的分布损失进行初始预训练。

Result: 提出的ADM在单步蒸馏中表现优于DMD2，GPU资源消耗更少。同时，在多步蒸馏任务（如SD3系列和CogVideoX）中创下了高效图像和视频生成的新基准。

Conclusion: ADM通过结合对抗蒸馏的预训练与精细调优形成了统一的DMDX流水线，显著改进了分数蒸馏在单步和多步生成中的性能，并提升了效率，为高效图像和视频生成设立了新标杆。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了HybridTM，一种结合Transformer和Mamba的混合架构，用于3D语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在3D语义分割中表现出色，但复杂度高限制了其处理大型点云的能力，而Mamba尽管效率高，但提取3D特征的表现有限。将两者优势有效结合仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为HybridTM的混合架构及其内部层混合策略，结合了Transformer的注意力机制和Mamba，在细粒度层面捕获长程依赖和局部特征。

Result: 在多个室内和室外数据集上实验，展现了HybridTM的高效性和泛化能力，并在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes基准测试上取得了先进性能。

Conclusion: HybridTM架构成功整合了Transformer和Mamba的优点，实现了高效和精准的3D语义分割。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因文本生成图像模型能模仿特定艺术家风格，尤其当明确提及艺术家名字时引发争议，研究目的在于开发对艺术家风格的识别和分析方法，促进模型使用的规范化。

Method: 设计一个基准测试，包括多种生成条件（如艺术家未知、新增复杂提示词等）。 使用监督分类、对比风格描述和少样本网络等方法进行识别评估。

Result: 监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示词下表现较佳，而风格描述在风格鲜明时更具有迁移性；多艺术家提示仍然有明显挑战。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了当前生成模型在艺术家风格识别上的不足，为未来研究提供了公共测试平台，旨在推进文本生成模型的负责任使用。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Result: 实验表明，Captain Cinema 能有效生成视觉上连贯且叙事一致的高质量短片，同时提高了生成效率。

Conclusion: Captain Cinema 在自动生成多场景长叙述电影中表现优越，是一种高效且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

Motivation: 大语言模型在生成类似人类行为方面表现出强大潜力，但其推理能力限制了下游任务的表现，论文旨在突破这一限制，改进行为模拟特别在电子商务场景中的表现能力。

Method: 采用强化学习框架Shop-R1，将人类行为模拟任务分为推理生成和行动预测两阶段，通过内置模型信号和分层奖励机制引导任务实现。奖励设计包括难度感知的比例分配，确保更细粒度的正确性，同时防止奖励滥用。

Conclusion: 提出的Shop-R1框架有效提升了大语言模型在复杂场景下的推理和行为模拟能力，为探索更真实的人工智能行为模拟提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为动态与泛化过程奖励建模（DG-PRM）的新方法，通过奖励树捕获细粒度、多维度的奖励标准，用以指导大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂场景中更好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型（PRMs）依赖启发式方法，难以跨领域泛化；虽然提出了LLM自评方法，但目前研究主要聚焦于反馈结果，忽略了文本中蕴含的有意义指导。此外，静态和粗粒度的评价标准无法适应复杂过程的监督。

Method: 提出动态与泛化过程奖励建模（DG-PRM），通过奖励树捕获和存储细粒度、多维度的奖励标准，并动态选择奖励信号进行逐步的奖励评分；同时引入帕累托支配估算来处理多方面奖励信号，识别具有区分性的正负对。

Result: 实验结果显示，DG-PRM在主流基准数据集上表现卓越，大幅提升在密集奖励场景下的模型性能。此外，在分布外场景中也具有出色的泛化性能。

Conclusion: DG-PRM有效解决了复杂场景中的过程奖励建模问题，展现了对复杂任务的适应性和跨领域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting

key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.

the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [96] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了六种AI文本检测工具在识别DeepSeek生成的文本方面的表现，并分析了针对检测器的对抗攻击（如标准和人性化改写）的影响。检测器性能因工具不同而异，而人性化攻击显著降低了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在填补当前文献中关于检测DeepSeek生成文本能力的研究空白，评估在对抗攻击下检测器的鲁棒性。

Method: 对六种AI检测工具进行了测试，收集了49个人类创作文本，并通过DeepSeek生成相应的AI文本，同时加入改写和人性化处理生成对抗样本，共245个样本进行检测器评估。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原生和改写文本中表现出接近完美的检测能力，但人性化攻击显著影响了准确性。少样本和链式推理分类在准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 当前AI检测工具在检测DeepSeek生成文本的表现上参差不齐，人性化改写是最有效的对抗方法；采用少样本和链式推理可显著提高检测准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

TL;DR: 研究探讨更大、更强的语言模型是否更符合贝叶斯定理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨更大、更强语言模型在面临证据时是否能更一致地更新其“信念”。

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致性系数(BCC)指标，并生成数据集以测量此系数，在多个模型家族和模型参数、训练数据量及基准测试分数间进行对比分析。

Result: 结果表明较大的预训练语言模型更符合贝叶斯定理。

Conclusion: 研究有助于理解与管理大语言模型(LLMs)。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种名为NeuralDB的框架，通过显式地将修改的事实表示为神经键值数据库，保留了模型的通用能力，同时在大规模信息编辑中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语言模型(LLMs)编辑技术可能破坏模型的通用能力，并在编辑大量事实时遗忘修改过的内容，因此，需要一种既可高效编辑也能保留LLMs原本性能的解决方案。

Method: 将现有线性"Locate-and-Edit"方法建模为查询键值数据库，并提出了"NeuralDB"框架：它使用非线性门控检索模块，仅在涉及编辑内容的推理中激活，确保通用能力保存。

Result: NeuralDB在编辑效果、扩展性、特异性、流畅性和一致性方面表现出色，并在六项文本理解和生成任务中保持整体性能，能有效扩展到编辑100,000个事实。

Conclusion: NeuralDB能够大规模有效地编辑知识，同时保留LLMs的通用能力，为未来大规模语言模型的知识更新提供了新思路。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [101] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS提出了一种实时调整大语言模型和视觉语言模型的方法，通过基于梯度的归因技术，灵活调整模型行为而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的实时调整方法依赖固定的全局干预向量，忽视了单个输入token的因果影响，且未充分利用模型logits的梯度信息。在多模态设置中，视觉和文本输入的贡献往往不均匀，这些问题使现有方法在细粒度控制上存在局限性。

Method: GrAInS基于对比和梯度的归因技术，通过Integrated Gradients方法识别出最具影响力的token，然后利用这些token构建方向调整向量以实现行为的调整。在推理时，它通过归因信号调整Transformer层的隐藏激活，同时归一化激活以保持表示的规模。

Result: GrAInS在TruthfulQA数据集上提高了13.22%的准确率；在MMHal-Bench数据集上降低了从0.624到0.514的幻觉率；在SPA-VL数据集上提升了8.11%的对齐胜率，同时保留了模型的流利性和通用能力。

Conclusion: GrAInS实现了在语言模型和视觉语言模型中的精细、可解释且模块化的行为控制，无需重新训练或附加监督。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究采用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，以解决手工标注成本高和语言变异性导致数据质量不一致等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前短语断句预测方法依赖人为标注，成本高且数据质量因语音变异而不一致，亟需更高效的替代方案。

Method: 利用LLM生成合成短语断句标注，并与传统标注方法进行对比，评估其在多语言中的性能表现。

Result: 研究表明，LLM生成的合成数据能够有效缓解短语断句预测中的数据问题。

Conclusion: LLM在语音领域可以作为一种可行解决方案，具有明显潜力。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在生成合成数据方面具有潜力，但其在多样性和隐私性上仍存在明显不足，基于提示的优化方法可以在一定程度上改善这一问题。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的口语语言模型评估基准多专注模型处理复杂任务的能力，而非现实会话场景用户交互的自然程度。

Method: 设计了TELEVAL基准，注重三维度评估（显性语义、语外信息和隐性语义、系统能力），通过对话形式独立评估文本和音频输出。

Result: 实验显示现有口语语言模型在自然会话任务中仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL旨在作为以用户体验中心的评估框架，促进更强大对话口语语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种动态结合不同方法优点的混合策略，用于大语言模型的参数高效微调，在多个基准测试中表现优越，显著降低了计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的微调因其规模和内存需求成为计算瓶颈，新的高效微调方法亟需研究。

Method: 对多种参数高效微调技术进行评估并提出了一种混合策略，结合BOFT的正交稳定性和LoRA-GA的快速收敛性，通过梯度导向的分层自适应更新实现更高效的收敛和泛化。

Result: 混合方法在GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench和HumanEval等四个基准测试上均优于单一方法，训练时间缩减至2.1倍，内存使用降低50%。

Conclusion: 混合策略是一种在资源受限条件下具有实践性和可扩展性的LLM微调解决方案，可在保持精度的基础上显著降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GloVe模型虽然广泛使用，但其数据和预处理细节缺乏明确记录，而语言和文化都在进化，因此需要更新的模型以适应当下使用。

Method: 利用Wikipedia, Gigaword以及部分Dolma数据集，训练了两组新的2024年GloVe词嵌入模型，并使用词汇比较、直接测试和NER任务进行评估。

Result: 新模型纳入了更多文化和语言相关词汇，在类比和相似性等结构性任务上表现持平，且在依赖时间的新NER任务如非西方新闻数据上表现提升。

Conclusion: 新版GloVe模型不仅改进了性能，还通过完备记录解决了原版文档中的信息不足问题，更适应当代语料需求。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Motivation: 大多数现有的口语语言模型仅关注语义内容，忽略了语音中的方言、情感、年龄等特征信息的潜力。

Method: 设计了一种双模态头部架构，分离语言建模与声学实现，并提出模块化分阶段训练策略，逐步对齐语言、非语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 实验表明，GOAT-SLM 在语义和非语义任务中取得平衡的出色表现，并超越了现有的开源模型。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM 的研究推进了更自然、适应性强、社会意识强的口语系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Result: 通过对九种主流模型的评估，结果显示当前模型在布局精细的视觉操作上远逊于人类表现。

Conclusion: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉任务的数学推理中尚需改进，尤其是在精细的视觉操作方面。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Method: 研究推出了一个名为HIVMedQA的基准数据集，由传染病医生参与开发的临床相关问题组成。评估了10个普通及医学专用LLMs的表现，并通过提示工程提升性能。评估框架包括词汇相似度和基于LLM的临床相关性判定方式，覆盖理解、推理、知识回忆等多个维度。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在大多数维度上表现最佳，但模型表现随着问题复杂性增加而下降，医学微调模型的表现并不总是优于通用模型，且模型规模较大并非性能的可靠指标。推理和理解比事实回忆更具挑战性，还观察到如近期性和现状偏见等认知偏差。

Conclusion: 研究发现现有的LLMs在HIV管理中的表现有限，需针对性开发和评估以确保其在临床实施中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

### [110] [Sticking to the Mean: Detecting Sticky Tokens in Text Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18171)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究Transformer模型中的"sticky tokens"问题，这些异常词汇会影响句子相似度计算，并导致性能下降。提出了高效检测方法并进行了深入分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到某些词汇对句子嵌入的相似度产生异常影响，造成下游任务性能显著下降，亟需研究其原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了Sticky Token Detector (STD) 方法，通过句子及词汇过滤检测模型中的Sticky Tokens，并分析它们的来源及影响。

Result: 对14个模型家族的40个模型检测出868个Sticky Tokens，发现其主要来自特殊词汇表或多语料剪切词，并显著削弱聚类和检索性能，影响高达50%。

Conclusion: Sticky Tokens严重影响了嵌入模型的表现，未来需要改进分词策略和模型设计以减轻其影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种评估框架，通过消除选项偏置来提高语言模型的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多项选择题中常因选项偏置而并非真正理解内容，通过构造新的框架解决这一问题。

Method: 引入SCOPE框架，通过空白提示估算偏置分布，根据逆偏置分布重新分配答案槽，同时避免语义相近干扰项相邻分布。

Result: SCOPE在多个基准实验中优于现有去偏方法，性能稳定提升，展现更清晰的正确选项信心水平分布。

Conclusion: SCOPE为改善语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Motivation: 为了解释ISO30401知识管理系统的实施与组织流程的整合方法，帮助企业更好地实现ISO标准合规和知识管理目标。

Method: 通过对ISO9001和ISO30401标准要求的分析，结合SECI模型和PDCA循环的方法，基于作者的实践经验进行研究和总结。

Conclusion: ISO30401知识管理体系通过与组织流程框架的深度整合，可显著提高组织的管理效率和战略对齐程度。

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GMTP的新方法，用来检测和过滤针对RAG系统的恶意内容注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖外部知识提供准确回应，但这种依赖性也带来了安全风险，如恶意文件注入影响生成结果。

Method: 提出了Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP)，通过分析检索器相似性函数的梯度辨别高影响力词汇，将其遮掩后通过MLM检查其概率，利用恶意注入词汇概率低的特性筛选恶意文件。

Result: 实验表明GMTP可以消除90%以上的恶意内容，同时保留相关文件，提升了RAG系统的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GMTP有效改善了RAG系统的安全性和性能，能够在多种数据集和攻击环境中保持高效表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了指令微调如何影响LLMs对误导性信息的敏感性，发现其可能因依赖用户提供的信息而更易接受错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令微调是否增强了大型语言模型对用户输入的依赖，从而使其更易接受误导性信息，并分析导致这一现象的因素。

Method: 通过实验比较指令微调后的模型与基础模型，分析它们对用户输入的误导性信息的反应，并研究提示结构中用户角色、误导性信息长度及警告提示的影响。

Result: 指令微调显著增加了模型对用户提供的误导性信息的敏感性，并从助手角色转向更加依赖用户输入。

Conclusion: 表明需要采用系统性的方法来缓解指令微调的不良后果，提高模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Prune&Comp的层裁剪方案，通过零训练的方式补偿隐藏层移除带来的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在层裁剪过程中因层的移除导致隐藏状态的显著变化幅度，从而引发模型性能大幅下降的问题。

Method: 采用无训练方法，估计层移除导致的变化幅度，并通过重新调整剩余权重来弥补性能差距，同时不增加运行负担。

Result: 通过一种循环裁剪与补偿的策略，Prune&Comp能够明显优化现有的层裁剪指标。例如，LLaMA-3-8B裁剪5层后模型疑惑度几乎减少一半，问答性能保留93.19%，比基线高4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp为模型压缩中的层裁剪提供了一种性能出色且高效的解决方案，有效缓解因层移除带来的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Method: 提出了一种“定位与专注”方法，通过有效定位语音片段中的术语并将翻译知识与语句及假设从音频和文本模式关联，以增强术语翻译效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效定位语句中的术语，并在不影响整体翻译性能的前提下提高术语翻译的成功率。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提升了术语翻译能力，还维护了整体的翻译质量，为语音翻译中的术语翻译问题提供了一种有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了六种OCR引擎在处理低资源语言（LRL）——泰米尔语和僧伽罗语——上的零样本性能，分析了其在字符和单词级别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管高资源语言（HRL）的OCR问题已基本解决，但低资源语言使用独特文字仍存在难题，因此需要评估现有OCR技术的能力以填补这一研究空白。

Method: 对六种OCR引擎进行比较，其中包含商业和开源系统。实验使用五种评估方法，分别测量僧伽罗语和泰米尔语的字符与单词级别准确性，并引入了一个新的合成泰米尔语OCR基准数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，Surya在僧伽罗语测试中表现最佳，character error rate（CER）为2.61%；而在泰米尔语测试中，Document AI在所有指标上表现最优，CER仅为0.78%。

Conclusion: 研究强调选择合适OCR引擎对于不同低资源语言至关重要，并为泰米尔语引入了新的基准数据集，为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Motivation: 设计一个高效框架将品牌风格或作者语调整合到大语言模型中，用于提高企业交流效果并保持指令遵循能力。

Method: 利用LoRA适配器，先在基础模型上训练多样的非结构化语料库风格特性，然后融合到一个独立的指令遵循模型。

Result: 在多数据集和模型测试中，实验显示风格一致性得到了显著改进，同时保持了指令遵从性。人工评估也证实了品牌风格的吸收。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM提供了一种高效方法实现大语言模型中的风格个性化，不需要配对数据且不牺牲任务性能。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Method: 通过数据中毒方法，利用可调触发器与详述的CoT响应相结合，使得攻击者能够调整模型推理过程的冗长性。CoT响应由“教师”语言模型通过编程生成，在正确推理过程中加入冗余步骤，同时保持输出的正确性。

Conclusion: 这种攻击方法是隐匿且有效的，主要影响资源消耗，而不改变答案的正确性，揭示了LRMs的一个潜在弱点。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有机器翻译模型在性别未明确标注的情形下，如何推断目标语言的正确性别，以及揭示模型依赖刻板印象的行为。

Method: 引入了一种基于语义不确定性的新度量方法，分析了模型在明确和模糊性别情况下的翻译表现。

Result: 结果表明，即使模型对明确性别翻译具有高准确性，其在性别有歧义情况下未表现出应有的不确定性。此外，去偏处理在有歧义与无歧义情况中产生了不同的效果。

Conclusion: 机器翻译模型需要同时提高其在明确和模糊场景中对性别处理的不确定性和准确性表现。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Result: 在30个NLP任务测试中，各数据集均取得性能提升，并达到了当前最佳水平。

Conclusion: TDR可以作为一种即插即用方法，提升ICL示例检索能力，同时对各种LLM兼容性强。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Conclusion: CLEAR提供了一种详细且交互式的方法来分析LLMs的错误，为模型改进提供了具体指导。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

*Silvia Cappa,Lingxiao Kong,Pille-Riin Peet,Fanfu Wei,Yuchen Zhou,Jan-Christoph Kalo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了维基百科中跨语言版本之间的结构化表格内容的不一致性，探讨其对知识可靠性和AI系统设计的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于维基百科作为一全球知识来源，跨语言版本的独立更新导致事实不一致性，这可能影响其可靠性及多数AI系统的训练效果，因此需要研究这些不一致性的特点及其潜在影响。

Method: 开发了一种新的方法，收集、对齐并分析维基百科多语言文章中的表格数据，并定义了不一致性的类别。此外，作者应用了定量和定性指标来评估多语言对齐情况。

Result: 通过对样本数据集的分析，研究揭示出维基百科多语言表格数据中存在显著的一致性和不一致性现象，并归纳了其影响及特征。

Conclusion: 研究提供了重要见解，有助于改进事实校验、多语言知识交互设计以及设计能可靠利用维基百科内容的AI系统。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

*Giorgos Iacovides,Wuyang Zhou,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的金融情感分析方法FinDPO，该方法基于直接偏好优化，解决了传统监督微调模型的泛化问题，并在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调模型在金融情感分析中存在泛化能力差的问题，尤其是在面对金融领域特定语言和未观察到的事件时。

Method: 提出了一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的金融专用模型框架FinDPO，结合人类偏好的后训练调优和新颖的“logit-to-score”转换机制。

Result: FinDPO在情感分类基准测试中表现优于现有模型，平均提升11%，且能够在现实交易成本下实现67%的年回报率和2.0的夏普比率。

Conclusion: FinDPO框架在维持强大财务表现的同时，展示了在金融情感分析领域超越传统方法的潜力。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出AraTable，一个用于评估LLMs理解和处理阿拉伯表格数据能力的基准。



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型在自然语言处理方面展现出显著进步，但其对表格数据，特别是阿拉伯语表格数据的处理仍然有限。由于资源的稀缺性和阿拉伯语的独特性，该领域研究不足。为了解决这些问题，研究设计了AraTable。

Method: 构建AraTable基准，包括直接问答、事实验证及复杂推理等多项任务，数据由模型生成并经人工专家筛选与验证。此外，设计了一个自动化评估框架，基于自我推理机制验证性能。

Result: 初步研究表明，LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）上表现尚可，但在需要深层推理与事实验证的复杂任务中仍遇到重大挑战。同时，所提自动评估框架性能接近人工评估。

Conclusion: AraTable作为一个开放资源和评估框架，为开发处理阿拉伯结构化数据的基础模型提供了有力支持，同时表明该领域仍存在重要研究机会。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床自然语言处理中的数据稀疏性和隐私问题。

Method: 系统回顾文献，分析生成目的、技术和评估方法的定量和定性内容。

Result: 发现生成主要用于文本扩展、隐私保护等；Transformer尤其是GPT架构最常使用；评估包括相似性、隐私、结构及实用性，且实用性为主要评估方法。

Conclusion: 生成的合成文本可作为真实文档的补充来改善性能，但隐私问题仍待解决，且需要更多人工评估。未来技术进步将显著推动相关工作流和管道的开发，并加速流程。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GraDe的方法，通过将稀疏的图依赖集成到大语言模型(LLMs)的注意力机制中，改进了表格数据生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据存在稀疏的特征依赖，而LLMs的自注意力机制不能有效捕捉关键关系，特别是在复杂数据集或语义模糊特征的情况下。

Method: 提出GraDe方法，利用外部提取的功能依赖指导动态图学习模块，显式整合稀疏依赖图到LLMs的注意力机制中，以突出关键特征交互并抑制无关特征。

Result: 在多种真实世界数据集上，GraDe在复杂数据集上性能比现有LLMs方法最高提高12%，并在合成数据质量方面与当前最先进的方法取得了竞争性成绩。

Conclusion: GraDe是一种侵入性小但有效的解决方案，为LLMs中的结构感知表格数据建模提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

datasets using ROC, PR, and DET curve analysis.
  Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false
negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt
engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning
remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.

the complexity of biomedical terminology and inconsistencies in annotation
across datasets. This paper introduces SRU-NER (Slot-based Recurrent Unit NER),
a novel approach designed to handle nested named entities while integrating
multiple datasets through an effective multi-task learning strategy. SRU-NER
mitigates annotation gaps by dynamically adjusting loss computation to avoid
penalizing predictions of entity types absent in a given dataset. Through
extensive experiments, including a cross-corpus evaluation and human assessment
of the model's predictions, SRU-NER achieves competitive performance in
biomedical and general-domain NER tasks, while improving cross-domain
generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer标记和BPE-600的混合标记策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的k-mer标记虽然能捕获局部DNA序列结构，但难以处理不均匀的标记分布及全局序列上下文理解的局限性。

Method: 将独特的6mer标记与通过600次BPE循环生成的BPE标记进行合并，形成平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 所训练的基础模型在next-k-mer预测任务中表现显著超越现有方法，达到10.78%的3-mer、10.1%的4-mer及4.12%的5-mer预测准确率。

Conclusion: 混合标记策略在保存局部序列结构和全局上下文信息方面表现优越，为DNA序列分析和生物研究的下游应用奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的解码算法WINO，用于提高扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）的速度与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs在快速生成过程中面临质量的显著下降问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为WINO的解码算法，通过并行的起草与验证机制来改善解码质量；该机制能重新验证解码内容，减少错误传播。

Result: 在GSM8K数学数据集上实现了6倍速度提升并提高了2.58%的准确度，在Flickr30K图像描述任务上实现了10倍速度提升并提高了性能。

Conclusion: WINO解决了DLLMs中不可逆解码带来的问题，在速度和质量之间达到了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用领域表现出色，但在特定领域效果有限。现有方法依赖于数据合成，但要么成本高昂，要么表现有限，同时任务的跨领域泛化性不足。

Method: AQuilt通过引入逻辑推理和自检机制，并结合任务自定义的高质量指令数据生成方法，构建了一个包含 703k 样本的数据集，进行领域特定的模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，AQuilt在不到DeepSeek-V3生产成本17%的条件下取得了可比的性能，其生成的数据对下游任务有更高的相关性。

Conclusion: AQuilt在保证性能的同时显著降低计算和生产成本，适用于不同领域的数据生成场景。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

*Andreea Nica,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Saibo Geng,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt 框架结合了基于文本的反馈和训练优化，提升 LLM 的推理能力，无需预先数据集收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以改进提示设计为目标，统一现有的文本反馈与数值奖励两类方法。

Method: 提出 TRPrompt 框架，直接将文本反馈结合于提示模型的训练中。

Result: 在 GSMHard 和 MATH 数据集表现出最先进的查询特定提示生成能力。

Conclusion: TRPrompt 框架有效利用文本奖励，实现了提示优化的新颖方法，为数学推理问题提供了更优质提示。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为“基于清单反馈的强化学习（RLCF）”的方法，通过从用户指令中提取清单，以综合得分驱动强化学习，从而提升指令理解和跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进语言模型对用户指令的理解与执行能力，超越固定标准的强化学习方法，提出基于灵活、特定指令的评估方式来扩大强化学习的适用范围。

Method: 利用从用户指令中提取的清单，通过AI评估和专门的验证程序对模型响应逐项打分，并将总得分计算为强化学习的奖励函数。

Result: 与其他对齐方法相比，RLCF在五项测试中均取得了显著性能提升，包括FollowBench上硬性满足率提升4分，InFoBench提升6分，以及Arena-Hard胜率提升3分。

Conclusion: 基于清单反馈的方法是一种有效的工具，能够全方位提升语言模型在满足多样化需求查询上的表现。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了符号回归（SR）在流体力学三维不可压缩流建模中的应用，其生成的数学表达式与文献中解析解完美吻合，并提出一种结合SR与知识表示框架（ASP）的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决传统机器学习方法因难以解释而被批评为“黑盒”问题，并在流体力学领域中强调对流动物理机制理解的重要性。

Method: 通过PySR库从数值模拟数据中直接推导出简短的符号方程，同时结合ASP框架以确保生成的方程在符合统计准确性的同时也符合物理原则。

Result: 推导出的方程可以逼近流体流动的抛物型速度分布和压力降，并与文献中的解析解完全一致。提出的混合框架可提高SR模型的物理可信度和统计精度。

Conclusion: 研究表明SR可将复杂的流动行为简化为可解释的方程，结合知识表示技术有助于提高数据驱动模型的可靠性及其与领域原则的一致性，为在需要可解释性预测和实时数据分析的框架中应用混合方法提供了启示。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA是一种旨在通过模块化子任务体现分析推理认知步骤的新型结构化推理系统，为数据分析提供更有效的洞察生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的智能数据分析系统在任务管理上表现优异，但缺乏对分析推理过程的支持，需要一个能够以结构化推理应对实际数据分析需求的系统。

Method: 提出了I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务形式模拟分析推理的认知步骤，包括目标解释、情境知识映射、抽象方案构建和基于中间结果适应执行等流程。

Result: I2I-STRADA在DABstep和DABench基准测试中表现优于现有系统，特别是在规划连贯性和洞察对齐度方面。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流在数据分析智能系统设计中至关重要，I2I-STRADA展现了其在此领域的优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Method: 提出了SmartAPS系统，这是一种结合了工具增强的大型语言模型，通过自然语言对话功能为用户提供查询信息、反事实推理、接收建议和执行场景分析的能力。

Result: 通过提供交互性强的对话界面，SmartAPS使操作规划者能够更高效地管理和调整他们的工作计划。

Conclusion: SmartAPS降低了APS的进入门槛，通过创新性的界面和功能为用户提供了更多灵活性和实用性，从而改进了供需链的优化管理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一种质性时间线规划，并提出了一种不需要确定化步骤的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通过非确定性有限自动机合成规划策略时的高计算成本问题。

Method: 确定一个质性时间线规划的片段，使其规划存在性问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空问题中。

Result: 成功识别了一个适合于这种确定性片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效降低了规划策略合成的复杂性。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过五阶段生成流程将AI生成错误转化为创意资产，并在实验中验证其对创意提升的显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动AI从模仿走向真正创造力的实现。

Method: 提出E.A.R.T.H.框架，包括错误生成（Error generation）、放大（Amplification）、精炼选择（Refine selection）、转化（Transform）、反馈利用（Harness feedback）五个阶段，并结合自然语言处理与生成模型等技术，使用复合奖励函数来评估和优化输出。

Result: 实验结果显示，框架提升了创意得分（提高70.4%），优化后的标语在长度减少（48.4%）的同时拥有更高新颖性（40.7%），与多模态测试中表现一致且人类评价良好。

Conclusion: 基于错误驱动与反馈增强的生成机制可有效提升AI的创造力，为人类对齐的自演化创意AI提供了具有可扩展性的路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析图表是否能够加强AI系统对数据的理解，就像它们能帮助人类分析数据一样。

Method: 使用两个商用视觉语言模型（GPT 4.1 和 Claude 3.5），就三个具有代表性的分析任务进行实验，比较在有数据配对的散点图、空白图表和错误图表条件下模型的表现。

Result: 实验发现，将原始数据与散点图结合能够提高系统的描述精确性和准确性，尤其是面对复杂数据集时，这种优势尤为明显。

Conclusion: 研究表明，像人类一样，AI系统也能从数据可视化中获益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中训练且缺乏理论保证，文章提出想法是为了解决这种局限性。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架MAGPO，使用自回归联合策略实现可扩展的协调探索，并将其与去中心化策略对齐以确保在部分可观测环境下的可部署性，同时提供了策略单调改进的理论保证。

Result: 在43个任务和6个多样化环境中的实验结果表明，MAGPO比现有CTDE基线表现更优，甚至达到或超越了完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为去中心化多智能体学习提供了一种有理论支持且实际可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ASI-Arch系统，通过实现人工智能自主进行神经网络架构创新，突破了AI研究受限于人类认知能力的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI研究受限于人类认知容量，亟需一种可以自主创新的系统来加速AI研究进程。

Method: 提出一种全自动的AI架构研究系统ASI-Arch，能够独立完成新架构概念的假设、编码实现、训练及验证。

Result: 通过20,000小时GPU计算，ASI-Arch发现了106个创新的SOTA线性注意力架构，展现了超过人类设计基线的能力。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch展示了科研突破可通过计算扩展，并为自我加速的AI系统提出了实施蓝图，证明了AI创新潜力及其拓展科学发现的路径。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在医疗领域的应用依然面临高成本、高复杂性和隐私问题，亟需自动化解决方案来简化流程。

Method: 引入一个由模块化任务专用代理组成的AI框架，这些代理能够自动处理包括数据预处理、特征和模型选择以及隐私合规等任务。

Conclusion: 此框架通过自动化高复杂度的机器学习流程，减少了专家的重复介入，为临床环境中实现AI提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床试验的安全数据采集时间有限以及疫苗快速部署，增加了对疫苗上市后安全监测的需求。

Method: 采用主动学习、数据增强及评价技术，通过注释急诊科分诊记录数据，优化分类器开发。

Result: 开发了一个分类器，能够迅速识别急诊科记录中的潜在疫苗安全问题，提高监测效率。

Conclusion: 研究结合主动学习和数据增强，成功提高NLP模型性能，实现更精确的疫苗安全信号监测。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

TL;DR: 本研究分析使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络 (GNN) 的表达能力。结果显示，在非均匀设置下，其表达能力等同于比例模态逻辑；而在均匀设置下，其能力与无交替模态逻辑相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索使用均值作为聚合函数的GNN在表达能力上的表现，明确其与不同逻辑类型的关联，及在不同设置下的性能表现。

Method: 通过数学逻辑方法分析，并建立GNN表达能力与比例模态逻辑、模态逻辑及无交替模态逻辑之间的关系。

Result: 在非均匀设置下，均值GNN比最大值聚合GNN表达能力更高，但低于求和聚合GNN。在均匀设置下，其能力对应无交替模态逻辑，且小于求和和最大值GNN。

Conclusion: 均值GNN的表达能力根据不同设置和假设变化，具有特定逻辑上的一致性和局限性。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种认知归因框架将知识与推理分离，通过分析LLMs在两种认知模式下的表现来量化知识与推理的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究集中于分析语言模型如何在推理中结合知识与推理能力，但较少探索如何区分二者的单独贡献。

Method: 通过引入“双系统认知理论”，将LLMs认知能力分为知识检索（快速思考）与推理调整（慢速思考）两个阶段，借此评估不同认知模式的性能贡献。

Result: 1) 推理调整的效用具有领域特异性，推理密集领域（如数学、物理、化学）受惠较多，而知识密集领域可能受到一定削弱。2) 模型参数规模增大可提升知识与推理能力，但知识的提升更显著，同时模型的推理变得更加谨慎但略微更智能。3) 知识主要分布于网络的低层，而推理行为集中在高层。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解语言模型提供了“解耦”视角，并对扩展定律、层级知识编辑和小模型推理限制等研究领域提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Result: 证明了三种语义（Forks、Justified Models和一定放宽条件的DI语义）是等价的，并且在语义上比第四种Stronger Supported Models更强。

Conclusion: 三种语义可归为一种共同的方法，成为传统稳定模型的扩展，而第四种语义遵循经典逻辑，较为独立。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI法律合规性及基本权利保护的复杂性，提供哲学基础用于AI风险分析。

Method: 通过定义性平衡处理权利之间的冲突，并使用可辩驳推理适应法律决策的动态特性。

Result: 提出了分析AI部署情境与基本权利相互作用的概念性构建，为高风险AI系统和通用目的AI评估提供了分层方法与理论基础。

Conclusion: 未来工作包括发展正式模型及算法，结合理论与实践以促进负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈（IB）原理的优化框架（IBRO），以改进大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，验证了在多种数学推理基准和强化学习算法中的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法多依赖直觉和启发式规则，缺乏理论指导，因此作者希望引入一种更有理论支持的方法来优化LLM的推理能力。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，提出IB-aware reasoning optimization（IBRO）框架，通过一个轻量级IB正则化方法，提高推理轨迹的准确性和泛化性，此方法无需额外计算开销，仅需一行代码修改即可融入现有强化学习后训练框架。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和强化学习算法中验证了IB正则化的有效性，表现出一致的性能改进。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM的推理优化提供了可行的理论支持，同时证明了该方法的轻量级、高效益以及有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了强化学习在呼叫中心路由优化中的应用，重点通过比较基于模型的值迭代方法和无模型的近端策略优化方法，分析其在减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用强化学习优化呼叫中心中的资源分配，减少客户等待时间和工作人员空闲时间。

Method: 采用了两个方法：基于模型的值迭代方法（Value Iteration, VI）和基于无模型的近端策略优化方法（Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO）。将问题建模为一个马尔可夫决策过程，并引入分布式事件模拟（DES）与OpenAI Gym的仿真环境结合使用。

Result: 在1000次测试中，PPO策略表现出最高的奖励分数，同时显著减少了客户等待时间和员工空闲时间，但模型训练时间更长。

Conclusion: 虽然需要更长的训练时间，但基于PPO的无模型方法在优化呼叫中心性能方面更为有效。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

TL;DR: 针对在边缘设备上进行低比特量化模型的高效部署需求，提出QuaRC框架，用以改进小规模数据集的量化感知训练效果。


<details>

Motivation: 解决在边缘设备上进行量化感知训练时，小数据集引起的量化误差以及性能下降问题。

Method: 提出QuaRC框架，分为两阶段：1）通过“相对熵评分”选择代表性子集；2）采用渐进层校正策略（Cascaded Layer Correction）减少中间层的量化误差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用1%子集，QuaRC在ResNet-18的2-bit量化下相比最先进技术提升了5.72%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: QuaRC框架有效缓解了小规模数据集带来的量化误差问题，并显著提升了量化感知训练的性能。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Conclusion: 通过局部邻域参数修改能够提高全局优化效率，同时保持对奖励和成本的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline

### [167] [Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788)
*Ali Vardasbi,Gustavo Penha,Claudia Hauff,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLMs）的位置偏差和低重复一致性问题，并提出了一种动态重复次数控制方法以减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在使用LLMs进行排序或评估任务时，因候选项顺序引发的位置偏差会影响结果。此外，当前克服此问题的多次重复策略计算成本极高，需要探索更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了一种动态早停方法，能根据具体实例适应性地决定所需的重复次数，并设计了一种基于置信度的改进策略，以进一步降低调用次数。

Result: 实验表明，动态重复策略平均减少81%的调用次数且保持准确率；针对改进策略，则能平均减少87%的调用次数，仅有轻微准确率损失。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法显著降低了重复调用次数，同时最大限度地保留了模型性能，本研究为提升LLMs在实际应用中的效率提供了重要参考。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的三步方法CICME，用于从多个领域的异质数据中推断因果机制，并在制造过程相关场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入研究复杂传感器系统的因果机制，旨在从多个领域的异质数据中提取可靠的因果信息。

Method: 基于因果迁移学习（CTL）的原则，提出了一个三步框架CICME，通过线性高斯模型在不同领域数据基础上进行因果推断。

Result: 通过在线性高斯模型和制造过程场景下进行验证，CICME不仅具有可靠的域不变因果机制检测能力，还能在某些场景中超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CICME方法有效利用因果迁移学习，在综合数据与单域数据分析上展示出独特优势，为多领域因果机制研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合扩散模型和大型语言模型（LLM）的时空预测模型用于用户服务级别流量预测，效果显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在不同城市环境中的适应性较差，且因用户流量模式的不确定性、缺乏环境上下文及不同服务间的复杂依赖性，预测效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一个名为LLM增强的时空扩散模型（LSDM）的框架，将扩散模型的生成能力与Transformer的自适应学习能力相结合，利用LLM捕获多模态环境信息以建模服务级模式及动态特性。

Result: 在真实服务级别数据集上的评估显示，与同类模型相比，该方法在决定系数上提高至少2.83%，在均方根误差上减少至少8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM模型具有卓越的流量预测能力，能够有效适应不同环境及复杂依赖，为网络效率和服务质量提升提供了新方法。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Method: 设计基于Copula的框架CoCAI，利用扩散模型捕获复杂依赖关系，通过一致性预测技术校准输出，并结合降维技术和Copula模型进行异常分数计算。

Result: 在水分配和污水系统的实际数据测试中，CoCAI展现出高效的预测能力及异常段检测能力。

Conclusion: CoCAI具备理论基础强、可部署时开销小和精确的异常检测优势，适用于多变量时间序列分析。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Method: 提出GenSelect方法，使用LLM基于长推理在N个候选解中选择最佳解，并实现对LLM比较能力的充分利用及对采样预算的高效扩展。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，像QwQ和DeepSeek-R1-0528这样的推理模型在应用GenSelect后，通过简单的提示显著优于现有的评分方法。

Conclusion: GenSelect不仅具备高效扩展性能，还充分发挥了LLM在比较推理中的能力，在推理任务中的表现明显优于传统方法。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Motivation: 气象降水的高分辨率预测对于减少局部强降水的破坏性至关重要，而现有的数值预报模型在这方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 利用Wasserstein生成对抗网络(WGAN)进行降水降尺度预测，用最优传输成本代替传统的均方误差训练网络。

Result: WGAN生成了更具视觉真实性和精细结构的降水场，且学习到的鉴别器得分与人类感知一致，同时可发现不真实的输出与参考数据中的潜在伪影。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提高了降雨预测的感知真实性，还提供了评价和控制数据质量的新视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有方法在解释GNN时无法有效捕获节点间复杂交互模式的难题。

Method: 提出GraphEXT框架，将图分割为独立子图并通过引入外部性结合夏普利值，量化节点对GNN预测的重要性，关注节点交互和结构改变的影响。

Result: 实验证明与基线方法相比，GraphEXT在多个GNN架构上具有更高的解释性能。

Conclusion: GraphEXT显著提升GNN模型的可解释性，在图结构与节点交互方面提供了创新视角。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Motivation: 当前生成分子设计面临正样本稀缺问题，阻碍了理想分子的发现。本研究旨在探索如何依赖负样本学习特性方向，从而生成具备理想属性的分子。

Method: 通过训练模型使用多样且充足的负样本来学习“属性方向”，并通过反向移动模型生成正样本分子，无需接触任何正样本数据。

Result: 在20次零样本设计实验中，该方法生成了比基于正样本训练的模型更具多样性和成功率的分子设计。此外，在双目标和少样本设计任务中，该方法也表现出提高多样性且保持设计性能的优势。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术方法以其简单性、数据效率和卓越表现，有潜力成为新型分子设计的标准转移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Result: MFNO显示出强大的分辨率泛化能力，超越了LSTMs、TCNs和DeepONet等标准架构，在性能上达到或超过这些模型的同时，显著提升了样本路径生成速度。

Conclusion: MFNO在理论与实验上均展示了处理非周期输入和高效逼近随机系统解的潜力，为相关领域提供了一种高效的新工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Motivation: 研究公共数据和私密数据在存在分布差异情况下的学习能力，以评估两种数据源结合的潜力。

Method: 分析了高斯均值估计和线性回归中的分布差异问题，分别探讨了小偏移和大偏移的影响。

Result: 当分布偏移较小时，需要大量的公共或私密数据；当偏移较大时，公共数据无助于改进。

Conclusion: 分布偏移程度影响数据源结合的效果，在某些条件下公共数据的帮助是有限的。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Motivation: 试图通过严谨的理论框架解释为何SOTA神经网络能够表现出色，以及提出新的数学预设条件用于评估学习的理想状态。

Method: 使用统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学技术，提出SETOL并验证其在简单和复杂神经网络中的实际效果，同时研究层质量的指标（alpha和ERG）。

Result: 验证SETOL在3层MLP和SOTA神经网络模型中的关键理论假设，指出HTSR alpha和SETOL ERG指标具有一致性，能够很好地评估神经网络的层性能。

Conclusion: SETOL为解释SOTA神经网络性能提供了理论支持，揭示了层特性与模型整体性能的关系，同时开发了新的评估与预测指标。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Conclusion: 验证了人机协作在生成可扩展的对抗性提示词用于T2I模型安全性持续评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for

*Hongrong Yang,Markus Schlaepfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanPulse是一种超精细的城市人口流动预测模型，结合图卷积网络和Transformer进行时空依赖建模，重点解决了跨城市泛化和计算成本问题，通过三阶段迁移学习达成高效通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人口流动预测方法存在局限性，难以兼顾城市间泛化能力和高分辨率预测，同时在计算成本和模型复杂性上存在挑战。

Method: 提出UrbanPulse框架，将POI单独建模为节点，结合图卷积编码器和Transformer解码器进行时空依赖建模，并通过三阶段迁移学习（预训练、冷启动适配和强化学习微调）实现跨城市泛化和适应。

Result: 在103百万GPS数据上测试，UrbanPulse展示了领先的精度和可扩展性，能够实现高分辨率的城市预测。

Conclusion: UrbanPulse的推出标志着高分辨率、AI驱动的城市预测技术在多样城市环境中的实践部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个名为MFTRR的框架，用于改进多模态语料的帖子质量评估，通过模拟人类认知过程克服现有方法的三大局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的帖子质量评估方法存在三大问题：单模态分类忽视多模态线索、信息融合过程中引入噪声、无法捕捉复杂语义关系。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了MFTRR框架，包含两个关键模块：局部-全局语义相关推理模块和多级别证据关系推理模块。这些模块分别处理细粒度语义交互和宏微观线索推理，并采用最大信息融合机制来抑制噪声。

Result: 在三个新构建的数据集及一个公开数据集上验证了MFTRR，实验结果显著优于现有方法，在Art History数据集上NDCG@3指标提升了9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR框架通过有效融合多模态数据和关系推理，可改善帖子质量评估，显示出对细粒度质量区别的卓越捕捉能力。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

modality-fusion transformer and temporally decoded by a prediction transformer
with rotary embeddings. Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod
dataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson
correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six
out-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture
obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second
overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Motivation: 旨在解决地理空间表格数据(GTD)建模和解释中的精度和效率问题。

Method: 提出两项改进：1. 优化数据加载和模型推理管道；2. 使用模型集合策略和基于GeoShapley框架的后处理解释功能。

Result: 改进模型在合成数据集上的实验结果表明，预测精度和推理速度均有所提高，同时解释性测试显示其能够有效捕捉空间效应。

Conclusion: 改进后的GA模型提升了性能，并通过完整的开放管道为社区使用提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIFOTL通过隐私合规的数据统计、双XGBoost模型分离噪声与干预信号，并结合Pareto加权决策树，解决了表格数据的隐私及噪声问题，用以识别数据偏移关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对表格数据处理中隐私规则限制访问和复杂噪声干扰分析的挑战，特别是在医疗保健领域。

Method: 提出SIFOTL方法，通过（1）提取隐私合规数据统计，（2）使用双XGBoost模型分离噪声与信号，（3）结合Pareto加权决策树识别数据偏移责任段。

Result: 在模拟医疗补贴的MEPS面板数据集上，SIFOTL以0.85的F1得分表现优异，优于现有BigQuery Contribution Analysis（F1=0.46）和统计测试（F1=0.20）。在18个包含噪声的EHR数据集上，F1得分介于0.75-0.96，显著超越基线方法（F1介于0.19-0.67）。

Conclusion: SIFOTL是一种数据偏移分析方法，具有解释性强、隐私友好、对噪声具有鲁棒性的显著优势，适合复杂场景下的应用。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新型学习范式，旨在通过“机器遗忘”提升交通状态估计与预测中的隐私保护、安全性及数据可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在交通状态估计与预测中，高度依赖数据，但同时面临隐私泄露、网络安全及数据时效性等问题。

Method: 引入‘机器遗忘’学习范式，使得已训练模型能够选择性地遗忘敏感、被污染或过期数据。

Result: 通过赋予机器“遗忘”能力，提高数据驱动交通系统的可信度与可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合机器学习的优势，此方法能有效缓解智能交通系统中的隐私及数据安全问题，增强公众对于系统的信任。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对大型语言模型使用GRPO进行推理任务微调时的高计算成本问题。

Method: 通过对Llama和Qwen模型进行实验，提出根据模型大小、初始性能和训练进展的经验缩放定律，预测奖励轨迹并划分训练阶段。

Result: 训练阶段可分为缓慢开始、快速提升和平台期，发现超出一定训练轮数后性能收益微弱，可显著减少计算资源而不降低性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架对不同模型类型具有泛化能力，为高效的GRPO微调提供了实际指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有的卫星数据和全球海洋模型在空间分辨率上不足以满足局地分析需求，需要有效方法提升海洋数据的空间精度。

Method: 采用基于神经算子的监督深度学习框架，可降尺度并解决任意分辨率的偏微分方程，同时适用于真实卫星数据和模拟数据。

Result: 模型成功应用于Copernicus海洋流数据和合成Navier-Stokes模拟数据并表现良好。

Conclusion: 此方法提供了一种强大的工具，提升了海洋数据的空间分辨率并实现偏微分方程的高效建模和预测。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Motivation: 针对现有算法在训练大型语言模型时效率、性能和稳定性不足的问题。

Conclusion: GSPO简化了强化学习基础架构的设计，对最新的Qwen3模型的改进做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,
efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为C-AAE的新方法，可减少可穿戴传感器数据中的身份信息泄露，同时保存活动识别的准确性，支持隐私保护的医疗应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的数据暴露了用户的细微行为特征，威胁到用户的隐私，因此需要一种方法在保护隐私的同时保留健康应用中的数据效用。

Method: 设计了一个结合匿名化自动编码器（AAE）与自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM）的框架。AAE对原始传感器数据进行特征提取，去除身份信息；ADPCM进一步编码，进一步掩盖身份信息并减少数据量。

Result: 在MotionSense和PAMAP2数据集上的实验表明，C-AAE在保护隐私的同时仅轻微牺牲活动识别的准确性，并且数据量减少了约75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE为实现可持续的隐私保护与效用平衡提供了有效的方法，适用于连续传感器数据的医疗健康场景。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文提出Squeeze10-LLM，通过混合精度后训练量化方法，有效减少了大语言模型(LLMs)的存储要求和推理时间，同时显著改善了低位量化下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型因庞大的参数和高计算成本，在部署时面临挑战。作者希望通过极低位量化实现模型的存储压缩和推理加速，但现有方法在低于2位的情况下性能受损严重。

Method: 提出一种分阶段的混合精度后训练量化框架Squeeze10-LLM，对80%的权重量化为1位、20%量化为4位。引入了两种创新技术：后二值化激活稳健性 (PBAR) 和全信息激活监督 (FIAS)，从权重量化对激活的影响入手，并通过保留激活信息减少层间误差累积。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2上的实验显示，对于低于2位的量化，Squeeze10-LLM在6个零样本分类任务中，将平均准确率从43%提高至56%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在极低位精度下显著提升性能，为模型压缩领域带来新进展，代码将在正式发表后发布。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在训练数据有限的情况下，寻求额外监督信息以提高分类模型的准确性。

Method: 使用概率分布形式表达硬标签和额外监督，并通过其仿射组合构造软标签；通过理论分析和误差收敛性评价引入和优化额外监督。

Result: 额外监督提供的非硬标签类别的分布信息对性能提升至关重要；额外监督和混合系数共同改进软标签，有助降低广义误差。

Conclusion: 适当设计额外监督方案可显著提升分类精度，即便简单使用亦有成效。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Result: PDA-DRL方法在延迟优化方面优于传统DRL基线模型，平均延迟减少38%；奖励驱动的个性化模型权重共享技术超越传统的联邦平均和基于流量模式与模型权重距离的策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在O-RAN架构中有效优化了RAN切片的性能，验证了PDA-DRL及奖励驱动的模型个性化共享技术的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 新方法成功诱导目标代理出现次优行为，并显著降低其整体表现，为对抗性攻击研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Abstract: The growing need for intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient autonomous
systems across fields such as robotics, mobile agents (e.g., UAVs), and
self-driving vehicles is driving interest in neuromorphic computing. By drawing
inspiration from biological neural systems, neuromorphic approaches offer
promising pathways to enhance the perception, decision-making, and
responsiveness of autonomous platforms. This paper surveys recent progress in

strategies, with a focus on their deployment in real-world autonomous
scenarios. Special attention is given to event-based dynamic vision sensors and
their role in enabling fast, efficient perception. The discussion highlights

robotics, neuroscience, and neuromorphic engineering to offer a comprehensive
view of the state of the field. Finally, emerging trends and open challenges
are explored, particularly in the areas of real-time decision-making, continual
learning, and the development of secure, resilient autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有噪声标签的类不平衡图节点分类问题，并提出了一个基于大型语言模型和伪标签技术的新框架GraphALP，实验表明其超越了现有最先进的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设标签干净且可靠，这与现实图中标签常有噪声的情况不符，因此需要一个能处理类不平衡与噪声标签的更稳健方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为GraphALP的框架，基于大型语言模型(LLMs)和伪标签技术，包含多个步骤：用LLM生成少数类合成节点以缓解类不平衡；动态加权伪标签方法减少标签噪声；采用次级LLM机制矫正伪标签引起的分布偏差。

Result: 实验表明，在具有噪声标签的类不平衡图上，GraphALP的效果优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: GraphALP在应对噪声标签与类不平衡问题上表现优越，为该领域提供了新的视角与实践方法。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Result: ChronoSelect在合成和实际数据中均达到了最先进的性能，并被证明在噪声条件下具有收敛性与稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过聚焦于学习过程中时间动态信息，ChronoSelect有效改善了噪声标签问题对模型训练的干扰。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本文的方法显著提高了自动驾驶场景中对未见交通环境的预测性能，可用于改进模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL框架能够有效应对联邦图学习中的效率和一致性问题，展示了在实际应用中卓越的鲁棒性和效率优势。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Motivation: 现有SINDy方法在设计合适的基函数库上存在困难，限制了其在复杂动力系统建模中的应用。因此，本文旨在通过优化基函数库的方式，改进SINDy方法的使用效果和模型可靠性。

Method: 本文提出一种名为SINDy-LOM的新方法，该方法结合稀疏回归与基函数库优化机制，并通过内外双层优化架构优化基函数库，内层提取稀疏线性组合模型，外层优化组建具有良好递归长期预测准确性的基函数库。

Result: 实验表明，SINDy-LOM方法显著降低了用户负担，提高了递归长期预测的可靠性，在柴油发动机空气路径系统这一复杂工业系统中获得了验证。

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM方法通过优雅地优化基函数库设计，提升了模型的解释性、可靠性和使用性，为复杂动力系统建模提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM 提供了一种有效的训练数据增强方法，为预测流程提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件快速演化导致ML（机器学习）检测器需要不断适应，但由于数据集规模庞大，完全重新训练不可行，因此需要研究持续学习的方法。然而，该文指出持续学习中的安全回归问题未被重视，这可能对安全应用造成严重风险。

Method: 提出了一种针对CL的回归感知惩罚方法，采用改进的PCT（Positive Congruent Training），以无模型依赖的方式减少安全回归问题。

Conclusion: 通过引入回归感知的持续学习方法，可以在不降低检测性能的前提下，显著减少安全回归问题，从而提高恶意软件检测器的长期可靠性和用户信任。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

Conclusion: TIDSIT在处理不规则时间序列的健康监测任务中表现出色，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

Motivation: 探讨和揭示现有协作多智能体强化学习算法为何表现良好的真正原因，并提出改进对任务设计和基准测试的建议。

Method: 通过针对性案例研究，展示了针对不同环境设定，学习模型可以适应性的调整政策，从而暴露这一问题。

Conclusion: 提出未来需要建立新的合作环境，必须强调两点：基于观察的行为和基于记忆的推理，以让成功依赖于真正的技能而非脆弱的共适应策略。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Method: 在物理信息驱动的机器学习背景下，提出PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets，引入低秩适应（LoRA），通过将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，降低可训练参数的数量并增加主网络权重的正则化。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets有效减少了计算成本，并增强了准确性与泛化能力，展现了在操作学习领域的潜力。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

### [212] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种名为HYPER的新方法，通过多模型集成和储备计算克服数据稀缺条件下洪水预测和水管理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据缺乏情况下，实现高精度、可解释性和计算效率的洪水预测问题。

Method: 对43个未校准的流域模型应用贝叶斯模型平均（BMA），并通过线性回归训练RC模型修正BMA输出。推断无测站流域的相关权重以构建通用框架。

Result: HYPER在87个日本流域的测试中表现优异，在数据丰富场景中，与LSTM表现相当但仅需5%计算时间；在数据稀缺场景中，性能稳定且不确定性更低。

Conclusion: HYPER是一种稳健、高效且可推广的解决方案，尤其适用于无测站流域的流量预测。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了双仿真度量以解决传统方法的两个问题，并通过理论和实验验证了新方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双仿真度量在表征某些场景和指定权重方面存在局限性。

Method: 定义状态-动作对的新度量，重新定义奖励差距并引入自适应更新操作符，同时提供理论收敛性保障。

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Meta-World基准上进行了实验，证明新的双仿真度量方法具有更高效的表征能力。

Conclusion: 新方法通过更精确的奖励差定义和自适应权重更新，提升了双仿真度量的表征能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GNNs对异质图学习的局限性，如邻居聚合不区分和高阶结构模式不足问题。

Method: 通过逻辑层、多头注意力边修剪和聚类机制结合，增强图表征学习。

Result: 在Cornell、Texas和Wisconsin等基准数据集上实现了有竞争力的性能，优化异质图处理。

Conclusion: GLANCE轻量化、适应性强，适合异质图场景，具有解释性强和鲁棒性的特点。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无数据知识蒸馏框架C2G-KD，通过结合语义和结构损失让生成器在教师模型和基于PCA的几何约束引导下生成合成样本，且无需观测真实训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在在无需真实训练数据的情况下，通过知识蒸馏生成高质量的合成样本，以构建有效的训练管道。

Method: 利用冻结的教师模型与PCA生成的几何约束，结合语义与结构损失，训练类条件生成器；通过仅使用每类少量样本，生成接近真实数据分布的合成数据，并保留拓扑一致性与多样性。

Result: 在MNIST实验中表明，即使极少量的类别结构信息也能支持构建有效的合成训练管道。

Conclusion: C2G-KD框架证明了无数据条件下结合几何约束生成合成训练数据的可行性与有效性，可用于扩展至其他数据不足的场景。

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种普遍力-度量-偏差定律（FMB法则），统一了解学习算法、优化方法和自然选择的数学基础框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多样化学习算法和自然选择之间的共同数学结构，从而揭示跨学科的统一原理。

Method: 通过Price方程提出一个力、度量、偏差的统一公式，并表明学习动态中多种经典理论的自然联系。

Result: 证明了该公式能够统一描述包括自然选择、贝叶斯更新、牛顿法、随机梯度下降、Adam优化等各种算法的本质过程。

Conclusion: FMB法则提供了一种用于理解、比较和设计不同领域学习算法的原则性基础。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨GPTQ算法在量化大语言模型时的数学本质，揭示其与传统格子算法之间的联系，并为其理论基础提供支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型体量的增大，模型量化是使其可在低成本加速器上部署的关键。GPTQ作为标准的一次性后训练量化方法，其内部机制缺乏清晰的数学解释，亟需更可靠的理论支持。

Method: 本文通过分析，证明了GPTQ算法从后至前对线性层执行与Babai最近平面算法在格子最邻近向量问题（CVP）上的等价性，并引入了几何解释与误差上界分析。

Result: 研究表明GPTQ的误差传播步骤具备直观的几何意义，并受益于Babai算法在非裁剪条件下的误差上界。

Conclusion: 本文通过将GPTQ与经典格子算法联系起来，赋予该算法理论可靠性，并为未来模型量化算法的设计提供新的思路。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Conclusion: 该方法为解决真实数据匮乏问题提供了路径，有助于独立、模型无依赖的公平性评估，适用于数据有限情况下作为可行替代方案。

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Motivation: 许多自主驾驶相关的学习任务依赖对空间数据的处理，但现有方法计算物体间相对位姿需要二次内存，这限制了其扩展性。

Method: 提出了一个SE(2)不变量的Transformer架构，通过缩放点积注意力机制，将计算内存复杂度从二次优化为线性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在计算效率和性能上较非不变量架构有所改进，且具有实际可行性。

Conclusion: 新设计的SE(2)不变量机制兼具内存和性能优势，为多种自主驾驶学习任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Conclusion: 多层次条件扩散模型和Protein-MMD显著提高了生成蛋白质的质量和评估可靠性，为蛋白质设计提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Conclusion: “Moving Out”基准测试和BASS方法证明了其在人机协作中的有效性，可为未来的物理环境研究提供新方向。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.

Motivation: 当前传统的冯·诺依曼架构在能耗与某些算法的适用性方面存在局限，而类脑计算被视为低功耗的潜在替代方案，有必要明确其计算价值。

Method: 分析了NMC与传统存储程序架构在时间、空间和能量特性上的差异，并探讨其针对特定算法类别的潜在优势。

Result: NMC能量缩放与传统架构的绝对算法工作量不同，而是与算法状态的变化率相关。此外，NMC对稀疏算法和与目标函数成正比的活跃度问题表现出优势。

Conclusion: NMC适合扩展性强且稀疏的算法，这使其成为迭代优化和大规模采样（如蒙特卡罗方法）的理想选择，同时展现了与传统多核系统完全不同的潜力。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过将定点乘法器单元分解成子组件来最大化功率效率的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高定点乘法器在处理AI工作负载时的功率效率，特别是针对零值附近的输入值。

Method: 首先采用编码器模块将操作数从二进制补码转为符号幅度表示，然后通过单独优化和综合组件来执行计算，确保原始计算格式保持不变。

Result: 4位乘法器设计在标准输入流下切换活动降低最高可达12.9%；在特定条件下，降低幅度可达33%。综合优化还能进一步提升5-10%的功率效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在不影响电路功能逻辑等效性的情况下，实现了显著的功率效率提升，特别适用于AI场景。

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.
