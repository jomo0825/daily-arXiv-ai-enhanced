### [1] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SNN结构的NeRF框架，通过动态时间步训练策略PATA，不仅提高了渲染质量还能削减计算资源消耗，尤其适用于资源受限场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF模型在训练和推断阶段都需要大量的点采样，计算资源需求高，限制了其在资源受限场景如边缘计算中的应用。SNN因其高能效特点成为潜在替代方案。

Method: 提出一种名为PATA的动态时间步训练策略，该策略在训练过程中自动寻找渲染质量与时间步长之间的平衡点，从而实现场景自适应的推断，基于Instant-NGP架构进行实现和评估。

Result: 实验表明，PATA框架在保证渲染效果的同时，将推断时间步数减少64%，运行功耗降低61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA框架成功优化了NeRF在资源受限环境中的应用性能，其动态适应能力为未来的神经渲染提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

Method: 本文收集了俄罗斯统一国家考试中122份扫描解答及官方评分，评估了谷歌、OpenAI等七款视觉语言模型在三种推理模式下的表现。

Result: 结果显示现有模型在数学推理和评分一致性上仍存在显著局限，揭示进一步研究的方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

### [3] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种能够快速重建和实时渲染城市尺度场景的框架，同时应对多视角捕获中的外观变化问题，性能和质量优于以往方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市尺度场景重建方法在外观一致性和效率上存在挑战，亟需一个能同时解决这些问题的框架。

Method: 提出了一种基于分区训练和可控细节的框架，使用可见性选择策略优化效率，并通过外观变换模块和增强模块提高视觉效果和外观一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在城市尺度场景重建的效率与质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对于大规模场景的高效重建及高质量渲染，为多视图重建领域带来了显著进步。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [4] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ScanDiff，一种结合扩散模型和视觉Transformer的架构，用于生成多样化且逼真的注视路径，在基准数据集上超越其他现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有注视路径预测方法无法捕捉人类视觉探索多样性的问题，为更好理解视觉注意力和多种应用场景提供支持。

Method: 结合扩散模型的随机性与视觉Transformer，建模注视路径的多样性；引入文本条件，实现基于任务的注视路径生成，适应不同视觉搜索目标。

Result: 实验表明，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于其他现有方法，生成的注视路径更具多样性和准确性。

Conclusion: ScanDiff通过有效捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动了注视路径预测研究的发展，同时提升了对人类视觉探索多样性的理解。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [5] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了利用深度学习的超分辨率技术（SR）改善低质量二维超声心动图的分类精度，验证其在高质量图像诊断中恢复诊断价值的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的环境中，低质量超声图像常限制诊断模型的有效性，SR技术在超声应用上仍不够深入研究，本文为提高分类精度探讨其潜力。

Method: 研究使用了CAMUS数据集，通过图像质量分层，评估两种分类任务，并利用SRGAN和SRResNet模型增强图像并提升分类性能。

Result: 超分辨率技术显著改善了低质量超声图像的诊断性能，特别是SRResNet模型，在计算效率上也较高。

Conclusion: SR技术能够恢复降质超声图像的诊断价值，可作为资源有限环境中AI辅助诊断的可行工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive 是一种新型视觉-语言架构，能够实时处理包括图像、地图、LiDAR 和文本路标输入，凭借创新的多阶段交叉注意力块和光滑度损失，提高了自主驾驶的导航效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主车辆需要在复杂场景下快速决策，同时处理道路几何和交通意图信息，但现有方法在效率和安全性上仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出名为 NovaDrive 的单分支视觉-语言框架，利用两阶段交叉注意力机制对齐路标与高清地图，并在图像和深度块上进行精细化表示处理。还设计了光滑度损失以减少车辆的急转弯和速度变化，同时微调部分 LLaMA-3.2 后骨干网络层。

Result: 在 MD-NEX Outdoor 基准的 nuScenes/Waymo 数据集上，NovaDrive 将成功率提高到 84%（+4%）、路径效率提升到 0.66（+0.11），碰撞率从 2.6% 降至 1.2%（-1.4%）。

Conclusion: NovaDrive 提供了一种高效安全的自主驾驶解决方案，缩短了行驶路径，节省燃料和电池消耗，可扩展至其他具身 AI 领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MObI和AnydoorMed是面向自动驾驶和医学影像分析的新型合成数据生成方法，利用扩散模型实现高保真且可控的多模态数据填充，用于逼真地构建反事实场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界数据收集成本高且复杂，特别是在安全关键的领域（如自动驾驶和医学影像分析），因而需要高真实性和高可控性的合成数据生成方法来弥补差距。

Method: 提出两个方法：MObI用于自动驾驶，需要单一RGB图像，通过3D边界框指导，在多模态场景中精确插入对象；AnydoorMed用于医学影像，采用扩散模型实现针对乳腺X光扫描的异常区域填充，保持结构完整性和语义一致性。

Result: 这两个方法展示了基础模型在自然图像中的引用式填充可以迁移到不同的感知模态中，实现逼真且可控的多模态情景模拟。

Conclusion: 基于引用式填充的基础模型方法具有广泛适用性，可为下一代系统创建高度逼真的可控多模态反事实场景提供技术支撑。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个集成视觉和语言的模型，用前置摄像头帧、上方地图和下个目标点生成驾驶操作，达到了高效能和准确性，尤其是在MD-NEX基准测试中取得了领先表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶中几何和语义信息通常分开处理的问题，本研究提出一个单一模型以同时处理这些需求，提供更高效和透明的解决方案。

Method: 采用轻量级目标中心的跨注意力层将各信息融合，并部分微调LLaMA-3.2模型，将视觉、地图和目标点紧密结合来生成驾驶指令和文本解释。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到了95%的成功率和0.80的SPL指数，性能超越PhysNav-DG模型，减少了50%的碰撞率，同时保持单一流程的高效率。

Conclusion: 通过将意图和地图布局从早期的token级别融合，XYZ-Drive模型实现了准确、透明和实时的自动驾驶性能，这为未来的自动驾驶技术发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Enriched-FineR的新方法，在细粒度图像分类中无需训练即可取得SOTA性能，同时具备高可解释性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理开放集分类任务时存在局限，依赖固定词汇和闭集分类方式，对于新类别适应能力不足。

Method: 提出了无需训练的Enriched-FineR方法，结合大语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs），改进了分类阶段对LLMs的利用，并抛弃固定的类名定义。

Result: 在零样本和少样本分类中性能与现有最优方法持平，同时实现了细粒度视觉识别的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Enriched-FineR方法提升了图像分类的灵活性和扩展性，为无需专家注释的细粒度分类问题提供了新方案，实现了语言驱动的理解框架，具有重要实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的开放词汇3D实例分割方法，通过结合现有研究中的多种概念并解决主要挑战，达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇3D实例分割研究中的各种方法并不互相排斥，而是可以互相补充。这启发了作者设计一个结合不同方法的解决方案来改进性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：首先进行三维建议生成，通过基于跟踪的聚合生成稳定的建议，并通过迭代合并/移除去除重复或部分建议。然后将标准的CLIP模型替换为Alpha-CLIP，引入对象掩码以减少背景噪声，并利用标准化的最大相似度得分(SMS)来提升分类阶段的精度。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上，提出的方法在所有AP和AR指标上均优于现有方法，甚至超过了一些端到端的封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 本文的设计通过结合和改进现有概念，实现了开放词汇3D实例分割领域最先进的性能表现，展现了其实用价值。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种名为X-NeMo的新型无监督扩散肖像动画方法，实现了通过不同个体的视频驱动静态肖像的动画生成，解决了身份泄露和表情捕捉不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理静态肖像动画时存在身份泄露和难以捕捉细腻及极端表情的问题，X-NeMo旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 提出了端到端训练框架，借助1D身份无关的运动描述符，通过交叉注意机制控制动画生成，结合双GAN解码器及空间、颜色增强技术，进一步提高表情表现力并去身份化。

Result: X-NeMo实现了更细腻表情表现的肖像动画，在身份保真度上超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新的运动控制框架，提出了一种高质量、无身份泄露的肖像动画解决方案，对相关领域的研究具有积极助推作用。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合重建物体几何、空间变化反射率和光照条件的神经逆渲染方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多视角光度立体方法依赖光源校准或中间线索的问题，提高形状和光照估计的精度。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，并应用考虑阴影的体渲染；通过空间和反射率网络预测场景属性。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度方面优于最新方法，且具备处理复杂几何与反射特性的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了一种无需光源校准且能处理复杂场景的高精度逆渲染方案。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型图像复原网络，采用Corner Loss避免边界和纹理丢失，并引入R-CBAM模块动态调整特征重要性，显著提升去雨条纹效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前去雨条纹任务中，如何在去噪的同时保证图像的细节和整体的视觉质量是一个挑战。

Method: 使用Corner Loss约束恢复过程以保留边界和细节，并在编码器和解码器中引入Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module（R-CBAM）模块以优化特征关注。

Result: 在Rain100L上获得33.29dB的PSNR值，在Rain100H上获得26.16dB，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在去雨条纹任务中表现出色，并证明了Corner Loss和R-CBAM模块的有效性。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on

*Shiyao Yu,Zi-An Wang,Kangning Yin,Zheng Tian,Mingyuan Zhang,Weixin Si,Shihao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态运动检索框架，首次将音频引入运动检索中并利用序列对比学习方法，显著提升了运动检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了大多数模态的顺序表示以及直观友好的交互方式，难以实现多模态运动检索的最优性能。

Method: 提出一个四模态（文本、音频、视频、运动）的细粒度联合嵌入空间，采用序列级对比学习方法对跨模态关键细节进行捕捉与对齐，并加强用户沉浸感。

Result: 在两项多模态数据集上实验表明，该框架在多个子任务上性能优于先进方法，包括在人类ML3D数据集上文本到动作检索R@10提升10.16%，视频到动作检索R@1提升25.43%。

Conclusion: 四模态框架优于三模态方法，展现了多模态运动检索在运动获取中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Motivation: 现有卫星图像基准中缺乏适合洪水区域分割任务的数据集。

Method: 收集2019年美国中西部洪水相关的卫星图像，选定10个位置的10张图片，保证分辨率统一并进行了数据处理；并测试当前先进模型及不同窗口大小对数据集的表现。

Result: 模型表现一般，表明需更多多模态及时间学习机制来提高性能。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

TL;DR: 本论文提出一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法，能够生成针对多模态大语言模型的对抗图像，同时保持图像的原始性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何生成对抗图像欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），以实现目标化欺骗反应，同时尽量减少对原始图像的变形。

Method: 提出一种对抗引导扩散（AGD）方法，这种方法通过在扩散模型的反向过程中引入目标语义噪声，从而在图像生成中嵌入对抗信号，并确保其具有全频谱特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AGD在攻击性能与应对防御功能上均优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过将对抗信号分布到噪声中，使其在降低失真影响的同时增强对抗鲁棒性，因此在欺骗和防御性能上具有优势。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法用于改进2D显微图像中食品晶体团聚的分类和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在食品结晶过程中，晶体团聚会捕捉水分并影响食品质量，而当前难以通过人工标注解决此问题。

Method: 提出了一个监督基线模型生成伪标签，并训练了一个同时执行分类和分割的模型。此外，为了保留晶体特性，设计了后处理模块用于改善模型预测。

Result: 所提出的方法在团聚分类准确性和尺寸分布预测上优于现有方法，并能在不同标注置信度下成功分类团聚实例。

Conclusion: 本研究方法有效提升了显微图像中食品晶体团聚分类和分割任务的性能，可用于解决同类问题。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在道路损害检测中存在多尺度特征提取不足及模型计算量大等问题，影响小规模损害检测及实际实时应用。

Method: 设计了BMS-SPPF模块强化多尺度特征提取功能，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低参数量和计算复杂度。

Result: 参数量从3.01M降至0.89M，GFLOPs从8.1降至2.6；在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上mAP50为67.6%，较YOLOv8n高2.11%，小目标检测D40类mAP50提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0 MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC不仅在多数据集上表现优异，且实现了小目标的高效检测和轻量化模型设计，适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

TL;DR: 重定义以更好反映现实场景的半监督少样本类增量学习问题，提出一种新方法ALDC解决分类分布偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督少样本类增量学习方法局限于仅使用当前阶段的新类无标签样本，忽略了更广泛的实际场景需求。

Method: 提出名为ALDC的模糊指导可学习分布校准策略，通过动态利用大量初始类样本校正少样本新类的特征分布偏差。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法超过现有方法，创造了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的GSemi-FSCIL新定义和ALDC方法更好地解决了实际场景中的少样本类增量学习问题，提供了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了RL-QR，一种针对RAG系统的强化学习框架，用于优化查询重写，从而提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化RAG系统的查询生成，提高从多样化、非结构化文档提取外部知识的能力。

Method: 利用强化学习框架，通过生成场景-问题对和通用奖励策略优化（GRPO），实现了适配特定检索器的查询重写，无需人工标注数据，并适用于纯文本和多模态数据库。

Result: 在工业内部数据测试中，RL-QR在多模态和词法检索器中分别实现了11%和9%的NDCG@3相对提升；但在语义和混合检索器上性能未能改进，可能由于训练失调问题。

Conclusion: RL-QR具有创新的查询优化潜力，为实际RAG任务提供了可扩展且无需标注的解决方案，但语义检索领域仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Motivation: 复杂的时空动态、遮挡、相似干扰物和外观变化等挑战催生了对目标跟踪方法的持续研究。

Conclusion: Transformer因其强大的时空建模能力推动了跟踪领域的快速发展，未来可能成为主流方向。

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种用于时间序列几何结构评估的新指标TGSI，并引入形状感知时间损失SATL以改善训练过程的结构建模，结果表明其在多个数据集上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估标准如均方误差无法衡量时间序列数据的重要几何结构，限制其对时间动态的理解。

Method: 提出了TGSI指标，用于通过将时间序列转化为图像以评估几何结构。为解决TGSI在训练中的限制，设计了形状感知时间损失(SATL)，包括一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失三种组件，以全面优化结构建模。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI评估指标上均优于基线方法，并且不会增加推理阶段的计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过TGSI和SATL的引入，该研究有效提升了时间序列建模在几何结构理解与量化上的能力，同时维持了高效性。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL)的算法，通过动态更新类别特定阈值，提高了部分标签的多标签图像识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在生成伪标签时较多依赖语义或特征关联性，但会因类别间分数分布的差异而导致标签不准确，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SATL算法，通过计算正负样本在每个类别内的分数分布，以动态更新类别特定阈值。此外，使用差异排名损失函数以提高正负样本分数分布间的可区分性。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模数据集上进行实验，证明该方法在有限标签场景下显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: SATL算法通过改进伪标签生成和动态阈值方案，有效提升了多标签图像识别的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PixelNerd的高效端到端像素空间扩散方法，无需VAE或级联管线，在图像生成和文本生成任务中取得了优秀的性能表现。


<details>

Motivation: 当前扩散变换器依赖VAE压缩的潜在空间，但两阶段训练模式带来累积误差和解码伪影。研究需要解决这些问题，同时寻求像素空间的直接建模方案。

Method: 使用神经场对像素块解码建模，提出单尺度、单阶段、高效的端到端解决方案PixelNerd，取代复杂的级联管线和VAE。

Result: 直接在ImageNet上实现了无VAE和无复杂级联情况下的优秀FID值（256×256：2.15，512×512：2.84），并在文本到图像生成任务中取得了GenEval 0.73及DPG 80.9的高分表现。

Conclusion: PixelNerd通过高效的神经场表示提供了更简单高效的图像生成解决方案，解决了传统方法中的问题并提升生成质量。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨通用模型SAM2在乳腺MRI 3D肿瘤分割中的应用，其低成本且无需大量输入，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前乳腺MRI数据需要人工解释，但这一过程费时且主观性强；而商用AI产品成本高昂，难以适用于低收入国家。因此，研究提出采用SAM2，旨在提供一种低成本、简便的解决方案。

Method: 结合SAM2模型，研究设计了三种切片分割追踪策略（自上而下、自下而上、从中心向外），并在患者数据中进行测试比较。

Result: 研究发现，从中心向外的分割策略效果最佳，且尽管SAM2是一种零次模型，在最小监督下仍能实现较好的分割性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通用基础模型如SAM2可在资源有限的环境中支持3D医学影像分析，提供可负担的替代方案，但仍需注意关键的失败模式。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为iLRM的迭代式大规模3D重建模型，通过一种高效的迭代优化机制生成3D高斯表示，解决了现有基于transformer方法的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于transformer架构的3D建模方法存在计算扩展性差的问题，尤其是在处理多视角图像或高分辨率数据时计算成本过高。

Method: iLRM通过三大核心原则进行设计：第一，将场景表示与输入视角图像解藕以获得紧凑的3D表示；第二，将全注意力多视角交互分解为两阶段注意力机制以降低计算成本；第三，在每一层注入高分辨率信息以实现高保真重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，iLRM在多个公共数据集（如RE10K和DL3DV）上的重建质量和速度均优于现有方法。此外，iLRM在同等计算成本条件下利用更多输入视角时，表现出显著的扩展性，提供更高质量的重建。

Conclusion: iLRM通过创新的迭代优化机制和高效注意力设计克服了现有方法在扩展性和计算效率上的挑战，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了UniLIP模型，通过构建统一的分词器，扩展了CLIP的重建、生成和编辑任务的能力，同时保持了CLIP原有的理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的统一方法在支持重建和生成任务时往往需要额外的扩散解码器或量化步骤，这会导致重建不一致或原始理解性能的下降。因此，研究的目的是集成上述任务能力的同时，保持原有的理解性能。

Method: 本文引入了两阶段训练方案和自蒸馏策略来逐步将重建能力集成到CLIP中，并提出双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散转换器，联合利用可学习查询和多模态隐藏状态。

Result: UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上的分数分别达到0.87和0.53，优于以往同类规模的统一模型；在图像编辑方面，也超过了BAGEL和UniWorld-V1等最新模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其不仅在理解任务中表现出色，在生成和编辑任务中也表现出极具竞争力的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BLiM框架结合CPN模块，在文本-视频检索中有效减少候选中的固有偏差，提高相关性，通过实验验证其性能超越前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态大语言模型的应用中存在候选固有偏差问题，影响查询与候选的相关性检索。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，利用模型双向生成能力，结合候选优先正则化模块（CPN）校准得分，减弱固有偏差。

Result: 在四个文本-视频检索基准上，BLiM与CPN相结合提升平均R@1性能6.4，并展现其在多模态任务中的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: BLiM与CPN能够有效消除候选固有偏差，增强检索相关性，同时对多模态任务表现出广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估文档布局分析预测中结构健壮性的全新基准——布局错误检测(LED)，并利用合成数据集验证方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档布局分析尽管取得进展，但在区域合并、拆分和内容丢失等结构性错误方面仍存在不足，传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 提出了一种命名为LED的新评估基准，其中包含八种标准化错误类型，定义了三种任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和基于元素的错误类型分类，并构建了一个合成数据集用于训练和验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，LED能够显著区分结构理解能力，并揭示传统指标未能发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED基准对评估文档布局分析的结构性健壮性具有重要意义，可弥补传统评估方法的不足，并为未来研究提供参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何图像编辑方法，通过分离的处理流程实现更复杂的目标变换及精细修改，并在新基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有扩散模型方法在图像中进行复杂几何编辑以及处理大规模变换时的困难。

Method: 设计了一种分离式流程，将目标变换、区域填充与目标区域优化分离，并引入了无需训练的扩散方法FreeFine用于具体操作。

Result: 在新发布的GeoBench基准中，对比现有最新方法，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精确度上均表现更佳，特别是在复杂变换场景中。

Conclusion: 分离的编辑流程结合无训练扩散方法为复杂几何图像编辑提供了一个高效有效的解决方案，并通过基准测试验证了其先进性。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督伪装目标检测方法ST-SAM，通过自训练策略增强单模型架构，结合Segment Anything Model，提升小样本标注情况下的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督伪装目标检测方法依赖教师-学生架构，存在预测偏差、误差传播、高计算开销和可扩展性限制问题。提出一个更高效且精简的框架来解决这些瓶颈。

Method: 使用自训练策略动态过滤和扩展高置信伪标签，用领域特定知识转化伪标签生成混合提示，结合SAM模型进行训练，并仅使用单模型架构。

Result: 在伪装目标检测测试集上，该方法在仅有1%的标注数据情况下取得了超越现有方法并可媲美全监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: ST-SAM建立了一种新型的半监督伪装目标检测范式，在低标注数据条件下实现了高效精确检测，可减少依赖特定模型或损失函数，极具潜力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Motivation: 复杂环境中道路要素的数量多、几何复杂且高频遮挡，传统方法未能充分利用道路要素的结构化先验，导致感知结果不准确。

Method: 提出PriorFusion框架，融合语义、几何和生成先验，采用基于形状先验特征的实例感知注意机制，利用数据驱动的形状模板空间生成低维表示作为参考先验，并设计基于扩散的框架进行预测。

Result: 在大规模自动驾驶数据集上的实验表明，PriorFusion框架在具有挑战性的条件下显著提升了道路要素感知的精度。

Conclusion: PriorFusion通过整合多种先验并应用于复杂环境中，生成了更准确、规则和一致的道路要素感知结果，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于变换器的文本到图像扩散模型如何在生成艺术作品时编码内容和风格概念，并揭示模型在某些情况下能够自发地分离内容和风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像扩散模型展现出强大的生成艺术作品能力，但这些模型如何内部表示诸如内容和风格等概念的问题尚未得到解决，研究此问题有助于解释这些模型如何在无显式监督下理解复杂的艺术概念。

Method: 作者利用交叉注意力热图将生成图像中的像素归因到特定的提示词令牌上，并对不同提示词类型对生成图像区域的影响进行分析，以区分内容描述与风格描述的影响。

Result: 研究发现扩散模型对内容和风格的分离程度因提示词和要求的艺术风格不同而异。在许多情况下，内容提示词主要影响与物体相关的区域，而风格提示词则影响背景和纹理区域。

Conclusion: 研究显示，扩散模型中对内容和风格的分离是一种自发现象，这为大规模生成模型在无明确指导下内部表示复杂艺术概念的能力提供了新的认识。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过创新的视觉Token修剪方法，显著提升了自动驾驶场景下VLA模型的效率和表现，实现了高效的前景信息保留，适合扩展到不同模型中。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FASTopoWM有效解决了现有方法的不足，通过新的快慢拓扑推理框架显著提升了基于时间的感知性能，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的车道拓扑推理能力。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中非常重要，但由于成像条件、扫描仪类型和采集协议的变化，模型在未知领域的性能会下降。因此，需要一种能够应对领域转移问题的泛化方法。

Method: 引入了隐式特征扰动技术，通过可学习语义方向选择器和基于协方差的语义强度采样器调整领域变异特征，并设计了自适应一致性约束，在调整导致性能下降时动态施加，以保持特征与原始预测的一致性。

Result: 该方法在两个公开的多中心基准数据集上的实验表明，框架在各种临床领域中均表现出稳健且具有泛化能力的分割性能，并优于现有领域泛化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的领域泛化框架通过改进特征选择过程和引入自适应一致性约束，显著改善了医学图像分割在多领域上的鲁棒性和稳定性，证明了其实用价值。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在道路表面重建中对动态遮挡、视觉干扰和光照/天气变化表现不佳，亟需一种鲁棒的重建框架。

Method: 使用平面优化高斯表征技术，在大规模建模中实现有效处理；通过分割引导的视频修复技术去除前景干扰；基于语义的颜色校正增强颜色一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能在复杂城市环境下实现鲁棒的道路表面重建，为自主驾驶中的高精准车道感知和高精地图提供支持。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Motivation: 研究低分辨率图像对面部检测性能的影响，以应对真实环境中的挑战。

Method: 评估YOLOv11, YOLOv12和MTCNN三个模型在不同分辨率图像上（160x160, 320x320, 640x640）的性能，使用WIDER FACE数据集并通过精确度、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间评估指标。

Conclusion: 研究为具有不同操作约束的分辨率感知面部检测模型的选择提供了可操作的建议。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: 通过THQA-10K数据集及提出的评估方法，有效推动了AGTH质量评估的标准化及模型改进进程。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉领域关键设计模式在图像识别、生成模型以及自监督学习中的重要进展和应用价值。

Method: 通过审视六篇关键论文的内容，包括深度学习架构（如ResNet）、生成模型（如GAN和LDM）、自监督学习方法（如DINO和MAE）等，详细分析其技术设计和创新点。

Result: 报告总结了残差网络（ResNet）的深度学习突破、Vision Transformer（ViT）的注意力机制革新，以及生成模型（如LDM）的高保真图像生成和计算效率提升，自监督学习中的DINO和MAE也展示出强大的分类性能和大规模预训练能力。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉领域的关键设计模式在网络训练更深、模型生成更优及减少数据标注依赖方面展现出显著进步，为未来研究和应用提供了重要方向。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本和参数过多问题，同时探索自然语言处理中的剪枝技术能否有效应用于LVLMs。

Method: 通过实验分析LVLMs中视觉-语言标记和层间特征差距的影响，提出Short-LVLM框架，依赖重要标记并缓解层间特征差距，同时不需要训练且具有模型无关性和高度兼容性。

Result: 实验结果显示，Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间实现了优越的平衡，并展现了训练自由、模型无关等优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM框架不仅可以有效压缩LVLMs，还保持了良好的性能与操作灵活性，对实现更高效的多模态模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Conclusion: VMatcher在实时推理任务中展示出强大优势，并开放源码供进一步研究利用。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Motivation: 现有情感理解和生成任务多为单独处理，然而两者本质相关，可以互相促进。需要一个将两任务统一的框架来提升总体效果。

Method: 提出了UniEmo框架，通过多尺度情感特征提取的专家查询机制，指导扩散模型生成情感驱动图像，同时引入情感相关系数与情感条件损失优化生成过程。此外，用生成模型筛选多样且优质的情感图像，进一步反馈至理解模块。

Result: UniEmo模型在情感理解与生成任务上显著优于现有方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 情感理解与生成的统一框架能够相互增强，并通过联合训练及生成反馈显著提升情感任务的能力。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理多源无监督域适应时，由于尝试一次性对齐所有目标样本导致错误传播和特征学习不足的挑战。

Method: 引入逐步对齐策略，首先从高置信度目标样本开始训练，逐渐引入更具挑战性的样本，减少确认偏见并促进更强健的模型收敛。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet等基准上，MP^2A优于现有CLIP基础的无监督多源域适应方法。

Conclusion: 逐步对齐策略能够有效缓解标签噪声问题，促进领域不变特征的学习，为无监督域适应提供了一种高效的方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 通过重新设计3DGS并将其空间特征与NeRF对齐，利用共享的3D空间信息实现两者在同一场景中的联合优化。同时，通过优化隐式特征和高斯位置的残差向量，提升3DGS的个性化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，NeRF-GS优于现有方法并达到最新的性能标准。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS互为补充，该方法为混合3DGS和NeRF的高效3D场景表示提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

Conclusion: AGA框架能够有效地利用小规模医疗数据，更准确地对齐图像和报告的多模态表征，具有良好的适用性和推广性。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 为解决现有生成方法在无监督医学图像异常检测中面临的计算高昂、不可靠及数据更换需重新训练等局限性，提出一种符合实时需求的高效检测方法。

Method: 通过Stein分数构造的去噪扩散模型（SBDDM），捕捉扩散路径曲率，仅需五步扩散即可实现高精度异常评分，同时利用一个在大规模医学数据集上预训练的单一模型，适配多种Near-OOD和Far-OOD基准测试。

Conclusion: SBDDM不仅性能优越，还高效且适应性强，可作为可靠的实时计算机辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: 系统包括两个子系统：植物来源识别子系统和掺假检测子系统。两个子系统首先使用线性判别分析（LDA）提取蜂蜜样本的相关特性，然后分别采用K-近邻（KNN）模型对蜂蜜来源进行分类和掺假水平进行量化。

Result: 在公开的蜂蜜高光谱图像数据集上，该系统的整体交叉验证准确率达到96.39%，性能优越。

Conclusion: 与传统化学检测方法相比，该系统是一种高效且具有竞争力的替代方法，可实现蜂蜜掺假检测的自动化。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational

self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可调的学习型超光谱图像压缩网络HyCASS，可分别调节光谱和空间维度，实验结果优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超光谱数据激增，存储效率需求增加，但对光谱和空间压缩结合影响的全面分析尚不足。

Method: 提出HyCASS网络，由多个模块组成，采用卷积层和Transformer块捕获短程和长程冗余，实现光谱和空间压缩调节。

Result: 在两套基准数据集上的实验结果证明了HyCASS的有效性，相比现有压缩模型有更优表现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了有效平衡光谱和空间压缩的指南，并公开了代码和预训练模型，可作为后续研究参考。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用机器学习技术对医学图像数据进行分类，并有效地诊断患者疾病。

Method: 使用5824张胸部X光图像训练基线CNN和DenseNet-121算法，通过Gradient-weighted类激活映射评估模型集中于图像的关键区域能力。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在医学图像分类中表现优于基线CNN，证明了其在识别疾病特征方面的有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦学习（FL）中的“分辨率漂移”问题，提出了一种名为分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF）的方法，通过热图知识蒸馏来提高分辨率鲁棒性，并在多项实验中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习主要解决统计异质性和通信效率问题，应用成功集中于分类任务，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）的应用不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于热图知识蒸馏的分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF）方法，实现高低分辨率间的多分辨率知识蒸馏，提高分辨率适应性能。

Result: 实验和理论证明RAF显著缓解了分辨率漂移问题并提升了性能，同时能够无缝集成进现有的联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: RAF方法在处理高分辨率任务中表现出很好的通用性和分辨率鲁棒性，尽管聚焦于姿态估计任务，但其潜力能够延展到其他需要保留空间细节的任务。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的抗无人机单目标跟踪数据集CST Anti-UAV，以捕捉复杂场景中微小无人机的动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机广泛应用引发了安全和隐私担忧，因此需要更好的无人机感知能力。而现有数据集的目标显眼、场景复杂性和属性多样性不足，限制了其实际场景中的适用性。

Method: 提出CST Anti-UAV数据集，包括220段视频及高质量边界框注释，具有微小目标及多样复杂场景等特点，并进行了详细属性标注。通过此数据集评估了20种现有单目标跟踪方法的表现。

Result: 实验显示现有最优方法在复杂环境中表现不佳，仅达到35.92%的状态准确率，远低于其他数据集的67.69%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明现有标杆和方法在复杂场景中存在局限性，新数据集的发布有助于推动无人机跟踪研究及抗无人机技术的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Conclusion: 新方法显著超越现有单任务基线，为AI在视频胶囊内窥镜领域的应用提供了重要进展，同时适于小型设备部署。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based
acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between
sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance
curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据驱动的方式解决了先前研究中的瓶颈问题，为3D数据模拟提供了更有效的解决方案，并为后续研究提出了新基准。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Method: 提出使用最小足够像素集（即通过模型视角捕捉图像本质的像素）来测量模型的‘聚焦’特性，并比较不同模型对像素集位置、重叠和大小的反应。

Result: 发现在像素集的尺寸和位置方面，不同架构（尤其是ConvNext和EVA模型）展现出统计学上的显著不同。此外，误分类图像的像素集合通常比正确分类图像的更大。

Conclusion: 最小足够像素集方法可以揭示不同视觉模型的决策行为特点，有助于更好地理解模型的决策机制并优化模型选择。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VRD模型无法很好地泛化到训练数据以外的关系，而现有的基于Prompt Tuning的方法在应对新颖或复杂关系时效果不佳。

Method: 提出ART框架，将VRD数据集转化为指令调优格式，采用自适应采样算法，重点关注信息丰富的关系并维持泛化能力，具体地进行关系分类实验。

Result: ART框架在多个复杂数据集上的评估中表现出对未见关系的强推理能力，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过ART框架能有效改进视觉语言模型的视觉关系检测能力，尤其在预测复杂场景的关系时表现出实际价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Motivation: 为解决手语翻译中视觉与语言差异及捕捉手部细微动作的挑战。

Result: 在Phoenix14T和CSL-Daily基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架有效提升手语翻译的质量与精度，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Method: 提出了MamV2XCalib，结合车辆侧LiDAR和多尺度特征分析，利用4D相关性体估算点云与道路图像的相关性，同时通过Mamba建模时间信息来解决视角差异和遮挡问题。

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib实现了不依赖于特定物体且无需人工干预的摄像头校准，在V2X场景中效果显著，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视图图像中的未见外观和几何细节推断问题，同时保证3D一致性和真实性。

Method: 利用生成式头像模型作为先验，通过将输入图像投影到其潜在空间以及额外的3D外观和几何约束，结合2D扩散模型生成的视图进行模型反演，最终生成高质量3D头像。

Result: 实验表明该方法超越了现有最先进技术，并能够很好地推广到真实场景中，同时生成的高斯头像本身是可以动画化的。

Conclusion: MoGA成功解决了3D头像生成中的关键挑战，在保证3D一致性的同时实现了逼真的几何和外观表达，为单视图图像生成高质量3D头像提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目前在追求高精度的同时忽略实时处理速度的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种纯2D方向性方法，通过切割3D体素特征保留完整的垂直几何信息，并采用方向性注意力机制提取来自不同方向的几何特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes上取得了mIoU为39.3%、推理速度27.7 FPS的成果。在边缘设备模拟中达到14.8 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了准确性和计算效率，适用于资源受限环境中的实时自动驾驶部署。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为Vcamba的新颖视频伪装目标检测方法，其结合时频运动感知，提高了检测精度，并在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依靠空间外观特征感知运动线索，但因伪装目标与背景相似性高，导致检测效果受限。本研究旨在通过时频特征整合克服这些局限性。

Method: 提出了基于接收场的可视状态空间模块、多尺度频率增强模块，以及空间和频率域的远程运动感知模块，最终整合双域特征实现统一的运动表征。

Conclusion: 结合多维度特征的Vcamba方法有效解决了伪装目标检测的难点，为未来相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保障医疗图像共享中的隐私，同时保留关键元数据，这对于医学和AI研究至关重要。

Method: 提出了MIDI-B挑战，包括训练、验证和测试三阶段，使用包含合成身份信息的真实去身份化放射影像测试工具的表现。

Result: 测试阶段10队伍完成，得分介于97.91%到99.93%，使用了各种开源、专有工具、语言模型和OCR方法解决任务。

Conclusion: 提供了全面的MIDI-B挑战经验与成果报告，有助于未来图像去身份化工具的发展与评估。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

Motivation: 为了在保持高性能的同时降低训练新条件的成本，解决现有方法泛化能力差和适配成本高的问题。

Method: 提出DivControl框架，通过SVD将ControlNet分解为独立组件，并通过知识分流实现条件无关的基础学习和条件特定的个性化调整，同时添加表示对齐损失以增强条件契合度和训练效率。

Result: DivControl实现了更低的训练成本（减少36.4倍）、更高的基本条件性能控制，同时支持对新条件的零样本和少样本适应，具备更强的可扩展性和模块化特性。

Conclusion: DivControl在图像生成的可控性和适配能力上均表现优异，能够实现高效的多条件图像生成并支持新条件的泛化。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Conclusion: EMAT有效提升了小目标的少样本分类与分割性能，同时更高效利用参数和标注，展现了很强的应用潜力。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅全面提升了尖峰神经网络的准确性和计算效率，还验证了其在内存和功耗上的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Method: 通过显式条件化时间元数据，提出OmniTraj模型，并在大规模异构数据集上预训练，同时进行了系统性研究和实验验证。

Result: OmniTraj在挑战性的跨设置场景中，显著降低了预测误差超过70%，并在NBA、JTA、WorldPose和ETH-UCY四个数据集上达到最新的最优性能（包括微调后的结果）。

Conclusion: OmniTraj的显式时间元数据条件化机制能够有效实现零样本迁移，在时间动态发生变化时依旧保持高性能预测表现，且具有即时公开的代码实现。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical

framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a

effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FlowGaussian-VR的3D视频重建模型，通过流场驱动的速度场渲染管道（VFR）和流场辅助自适应加密策略（FAD），提升了动态场景的重建效果，解决了复杂运动和多尺度变化下的不良表现问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D视频重建方法在处理复杂运动和显著尺度变化的视频时表现不足，特别是变形网络容易过拟合导致视觉质量下降，同时静态场景的加密策略难以处理动态内容。

Method: 提出了一种流驱动的速度场建模方法，包括速度场渲染（VFR）用于光流优化，以及流场辅助的自适应加密策略（FAD），分别优化动态区域高斯数量和大小。

Result: 模型在多个真实世界数据集上的动态重建和新视图合成任务中表现优异，PSNR提升超过2.5dB，动态纹理的模糊伪影减少，高斯轨迹更加规则且可跟踪。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR显著改进了现有方法在多视角动态重建与新视图合成中的表现，特别是在复杂运动视频中提供了更高的视觉质量，并提高了模型的鲁棒性和可跟踪性。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 该方法展现了数据驱动正则化的潜力，证明可以完全替代传统功能映射中的公理化策略，为零样本形状匹配提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Motivation: 尽管CBMs具有解释性能，但在处理现实中的分布变化时表现不佳，尤其在医学等关键领域透明性需求高。因此，需要一个基准来系统评估CBMs在变量概念识别中的鲁棒性。

Result: SUB数据集包含38,400张基于CUB数据集生成的高精度合成图像，该数据集和方法可有效评估和改进CBMs模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过新数据集和生成方法，本文为评估和改进CBMs这类可解释模型的能力提供了重要工具，有助于推动鲁棒性算法的发展。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Object-Centric Learning方法，即DIAS，通过插槽重新初始化和自蒸馏减少冗余并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流对象中心学习方法存在插槽冗余导致对象被错误分割的问题，同时仅通过输入重建进行监督，未充分利用内部信息。

Method: DIAS方法包括插槽重新初始化以减少冗余，以及利用首尾聚合迭代的注意力图驱动自蒸馏。

Result: DIAS在对象发现与识别等任务上达到了最新的技术水平，并改进了视觉预测与推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS通过重新初始化插槽和自蒸馏方法，改进了对象中心学习的表现，具有潜在的广泛应用价值。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Result: 模型实现了与场景和物体的真实交互，避免了穿透和不现实的动态表现。

Conclusion: 方法无须学习，适用于任何体型和运动，并且实时运行，保持了原始运动的真实性。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Conclusion: 提出了一种针对稀疏多视角视频的动态场景重建方法，性能优于现有方法并公开了代码与数据脚本。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

*Jinzhi Wang,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Qinfeng Song,Kaixuan Yang,Jiangbo Zhang,Yaoying Wang,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ElectriQ，一个评估和提升大语言模型（LLMs）在电力营销场景下表现的基准测试，包括数据集和四项衡量指标，并验证了利用知识增强和微调后的小模型能超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力营销客户服务系统存在响应慢、流程僵化和特定领域任务准确性有限的问题，而通用大模型缺乏此领域的专业性和共情能力。

Method: 设计了名为ElectriQ的基准测试，包括六类服务场景的对话数据集和四种评价指标，并引入领域知识库和知识增强方法，提升模型表现。

Result: 实验表明，经过微调和增强的小模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性方面优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ提供了一套全面的基础设施，以开发适合电力营销服务的大语言模型，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一个混合分类框架，结合了微调语言模型和半监督集成学习策略，能够检测和分类非法市场上的内容，特别是在深网和暗网以及Telegram等平台上的表现超过多个基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法交易市场逐渐转向隐秘的网络部分，内容检测因数据稀缺和语言复杂性等原因面临挑战，因此需要一种强大的方法来高效识别和分类这些内容。

Method: 提出一个分层分类框架，使用ModernBERT提取语义表示，并结合文档结构和嵌入特征；两阶段分类模型在检测和具体分类中分别使用半监督集成学习策略和预训练语言模型。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现突出，准确率达到0.96489，F1分数为0.93467，显示出在有限监督下的强鲁棒性和现实应用效果好。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效检测和分类非法市场内容，表现优异且具有强的通用性，对实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一个将嵌入式ML模型与LLM相结合的混合框架，用于改进图书主题的分析，减少过度生成和幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在学科分析中的应用尚未充分探索，而传统ML模型难以处理未知案例，LLMs可能会过度生成标签且容易出现幻觉。

Method: 提出一种混合框架，利用ML模型预测最佳LCSH标签数量并指导LLM生成，同时通过实际LCSH词汇进行后期编辑，调整预测结果。

Result: 实验证明，该混合框架可以控制LLM输出并使之更符合LCSH词表的一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合ML模型与LLMs，改进了图书主题分析的准确性和输出的可控性，展现了应用潜力。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合标签匹配和三元组匹配的知识图谱（KG）集成新方法，旨在解决现有方法在复杂上下文整合场景中表现不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的实体匹配方法在应对多样化和复杂上下文整合时存在局限性，尤其是面对不同来源、大小和信息密度不均的知识图谱，因此需要新的方法来改进集成效果。

Method: 设计了一种由标签匹配和三元组匹配构成的集成方法，通过字符串操作、模糊匹配和向量相似度对实体和谓词标签对齐，并通过三元组映射提升匹配精度。同时推出了一个新数据集，用于更全面地评估三元组匹配步骤。

Result: 该方法在OAEI竞赛和监督学习方法上表现出竞争力，特别是在多样化的测试场景中实现了高匹配精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效弥补了现有实体匹配方法的不足，特别是其整合复杂上下文信息的能力，同时通过所提出的新数据集评估方法的适用性，验证了其实用价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Motivation: 针对当前大语言模型生成不符合输入逻辑或真实世界信息的内容带来的问题，明确定义和研究幻觉现象。

Method: 区分内在和外在幻觉，提出幻觉风险的定义，并基于学习理论框架（PAC-Bayes 和 Rademacher complexity）推导风险边界。总结检测方法如不确定性估计、注意力校准等，并探讨缓解方法如增强检索生成、幻觉感知微调等。提出统一的检测和缓解流程，并推荐评估协议。

Result: 为幻觉的检测、缓解和评估提供全面的理论分析和实践框架。

Conclusion: 通过建立理论基础和实践指导，研究为解决 LLM 中的幻觉挑战提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，提升RAG系统在处理涉及时间维度问题时的表现，表现优于标准RAG实现13%-27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理涉及时间维度的查询时存在不足，特别是无法有效应对需要跟踪时间跨度的实体和现象的问题。

Method: 通过重新设计RAG管道，引入时间逻辑，方法包括将用户查询拆解为核心主题和时间窗口，并采用专门的检索器同时校准语义和时间相关性，以确保证据的时间连续性。

Result: 在ADQAB基准测试中，提出的方法的答案准确度相比标准RAG实现提高了13%-27%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种可改进RAG系统复杂问题处理能力的方案，并通过公开数据集和代码验证了其实用性。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在规模不同的情况下，其内部特征的一致性和普遍性是否成立。

Method: 使用稀疏自动编码器(SAE)管道提取模型的残差流激活特征，并通过激活相关性对齐这些单义特征，同时利用SVCCA和RSA比较匹配的特征空间。

Result: 中间层的特征相似性最高，而早期和晚期层的相似性要低得多；初步实验表明，多标记子空间的语义关系在模型中有类似的交互模式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型尽管规模不同，但能以相似且可解释的方式分解世界，支持跨模型可解释性中的普遍性原则。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，帮助设计避免提前终止的临床试验，并限制对参与者的不必要风险暴露。

Method: 使用ClinicalTrials.gov中22,107个双臂平行干预性临床试验数据，结合预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）和滑动窗口方法，进行特征提取和预测。

Result: 最佳模型在预测SAE较高发生率的实验组获得了77.6%的AUC值；而预测对照组参与者发生SAE比例的RMSE为18.6%。滑动窗口方法优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ClinicalTrials.gov的摘要结果数据具有预测尚未开始试验结果的潜力，可用于优化试验设计并发现潜在安全性结果差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

Conclusion: 本文建立了传统VQ与现代LLM应用之间的桥梁，为高效且可推广的多模态系统开发提供了参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

Motivation: 当前语言模型存在昂贵且可能生成虚假信息的问题。错误的信息不仅浪费计算资源，还可能导致结果的彻底失效。

Method: LMC算法通过一个多阶段的语言模型级联，递进式地筛选和分离错误预测，将复杂任务分解并分配给更高效或更准确的语言模型处理，最终确保所有的预测均为正确答案。

Result: 在从医疗文档中提取出生日期的任务中，LMC算法的大幅度提高了预测速度和准确性，同时显著减少了虚假信息的生成。

Conclusion: LMC算法对知识提取领域作出了重要贡献，有潜力成为该领域进一步研究的基础工具。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

Motivation: 2021年GameStop事件点燃了关于散户投资者在社交媒体上的活动对股价影响的讨论，本文旨在探讨社交媒体情绪能否预测股票市场走势。

Method: 研究分析Reddit r/wallstreetbets中针对GameStop和AMC的讨论，采用两种现有情绪分析方法，并引入一个基于ChatGPT标注及RoBERTa微调的新模型，结合相关性与因果性分析评估预测能力。

Result: 结果表明，社交媒体情绪与股票价格的相关性较弱，而评论量与谷歌搜索趋势则表现出更强的预测信号。

Conclusion: 散户投资者行为复杂性高，传统情绪分析无法完整捕捉影响市场讨论的微妙因素。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Result: 实验表明，优化的提示翻译策略能显著增强多语言知识共享能力，并提高分类任务的性能表现，特别是在低资源语言场景下。

Conclusion: 优化的跨语言提示翻译策略对于改进非英语语言（尤其是低资源语言）的系统性能具有重要意义，强调了多语言资源共享和提示优化的重要性。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于研究生课程中非母语学生比例较高，研究如何改善他们在英语环境中接受教育的体验。

Method: 使用基于Twitter-roBERTa的模型分析500名学生的同侪反馈情感，并研究与语言背景的关系。

Result: 母语英语使用者评价反馈不如非母语者积极，非母语者给出的反馈更积极，但获得的反馈情感较低。性别和年龄也会影响这一结果。

Conclusion: 语言背景对同侪反馈体验的影响复杂且不显著，但值得进一步关注以优化多语言学习环境。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Conclusion: H-MEM通过分层记忆和高效检索提升了LLM Agents的长期推理能力，在对话应用中表现卓越。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的输入嵌入方法，改进文档级别关系抽取，提升关系预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏捕捉文档整体语境的能力，仅关注实体提及的句子，但忽略了实体在文档中不同位置的联系。

Method: 通过引入新的输入编码方法，将实体表示为独立的片段，捕捉文档全局关系和跨句推理，而不仅限于实体出现的局部位置。

Result: 实验表明该方法在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL三个基准数据集上的表现优异，提高了文档级别的关系预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究在理论上推进了全局语境建模和跨句推理，在实践上则提升了文档级别实体关系检测的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark，一个针对RAG系统的多层次细粒度评估基准，并揭示当前LLMs能力局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准缺乏对RAG系统中LLMs能力的细粒度评估框架。

Method: 提出Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark，从多级过滤、结合能力和参考推理三个维度进行系统化评估，同时通过占位符方法分离LLMs固有知识与外部知识的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，现有代表性LLMs在生成能力上存在局限性，尤其在错误恢复和上下文忠实性方面。

Conclusion: 该基准为研发更可靠高效的RAG系统提供了可复现框架，拓展了细粒度评估工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次以特征层级进行因果分析，探讨链式思考（CoT）提示是否能在大语言模型中引发真实的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比分析链式思考提示（CoT）和普通无链式提示（noCoT）在数学问题中的表现，确认CoT是否真正作用于模型的推理能力。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活补丁技术，提取单义性特征，并通过特征替换实验评估激活模式对高容量语言模型的影响。

Result: 在Pythia-2.8B模型中，CoT关联的推理特征显著提高了回答的对数概率，且模型内部的稀疏性与可解释性均改善。

Conclusion: 链式思考提示在高容量语言模型中可诱发更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Motivation: 目前MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在因有限的眼科知识、不足的视觉定位与推理能力而导致的幻觉问题，且现有医学评估基准也无法有效评估或缓解这些问题。

Method: 研究提出了一种三阶段的多代理框架，包括知识层次检索阶段、任务层次案例研究阶段和结果层次验证阶段，对MLLMs的幻觉问题进行评估和减轻。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为评估与减轻MLLMs幻觉问题提供了一种有效工具，具有改进眼科诊断效果的潜力。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着PII泄露问题增多，对检测和识别此类信息需求增加，而现存数据集的开放性成问题。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过3种大语言模型（如Llama2-7B等）生成合成PII数据集，并使用多项指标评估其有效性。

Result: 生成了19种PII分类法的合成数据集，验证了其可复现性、匿名性以及与原始数据的相似性。

Conclusion: 提供开源数据集和代码，推动在线社交媒体PII隐私风险的可复现研究。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

TL;DR: 本文提出ACC-RAG框架，通过动态调整压缩率，优化推理效率并保持准确性。通过分层压缩和上下文选择，实现类似人类快速浏览的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规固定压缩率方法在简单查询过度压缩，复杂查询欠压缩。需要一个动态调整压缩率的解决方案以提高推理效率。

Method: 提出ACC-RAG框架，结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，根据输入复杂性动态调整压缩率，保留最少充分信息。

Result: ACC-RAG在维基百科和五个QA数据集上，优于固定压缩率方法，同时相比标准RAG实现超过4倍的推理速度提升，且保持或提高准确率。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG通过自适应压缩率优化推理效率，是一种高效、准确的RAG方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as

construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架有效提升了AIOps的任务处理效率与准确性，展示了在复杂任务中协作式专家模式的优势。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了PARROT，一个开放获取的大型虚构放射学报告数据集，用于自然语言处理应用测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决跨语言测试NLP应用在放射学领域中的挑战，作者希望创建一个多语言、跨地域且开放访问的放射学报告数据集。

Method: 从2024年5月至9月，放射科医生提交他们标准写作中的虚构报告，涵盖多种语言及附加的相关元数据；在人类与AI生成报告的区分研究中，154名参与者进行了准确性评估。

Result: 数据集包含76位作者提供的来自21个国家的2658份报告（覆盖13种语言、多个成像模态和解剖区域），在人类与AI报告区分研究中，参与者准确率低于60%，其中放射医生表现稍优。

Conclusion: PARROT提供了目前最大的开放多语言放射学报告数据集，支持跨语言与临床边界的自然语言处理开发，同时避免隐私问题。

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

### [126] [Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940)
*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出RELIANCE框架，旨在提高大语言模型中推理步骤的事实准确性，同时保持最终结果正确性，以应对高风险领域的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中推理步骤的事实不准确性问题，尤其是在医疗、法律和科学研究等高风险领域。

Method: 框架包括三个核心组件：1）基于反事实增强数据训练的事实检查分类器；2）一种多维奖励机制的强化学习方法（GRPO）；3）一个机械可解释性模块，用以分析事实改善对模型激活的影响。

Result: 实验证明RELIANCE框架在现有十种模型中显著提高了事实健壮性（最高提升49.90%），且对关键基准测试保持或改进了表现。

Conclusion: RELIANCE框架有效提升了模型在推理过程中的事实准确性，同时为未来的模型训练方法提供了基于激活指导优化的事实增强路径。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT使用自然语言处理和数学方法，从时序电子病历中提取几何特征，用于患者生存分析，模型在真实肿瘤学数据上的C-index得分为0.75，显著提高了风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的生存分析无法有效处理复杂文本数据及其时序特性，研究旨在利用电子病历数据增强生存分析。

Method: 提出SigBERT框架，通过嵌入技术处理文本，将句子嵌入时间序列转换为几何特征，并使用LASSO-Cox模型进行风险评分预测。

Result: 在真实肿瘤学数据库上性能测评，SigBERT在独立测试集上的C-index得分达到0.75（0.014标准差）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序文本特征显著提高患者风险评估，并为基于叙述的生存分析开辟新途径。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种加速验证基于代码算法的高效方法，利用自然语言处理（NLP）和多阶段自适应抽样策略以减少手动工作量，并通过一项案例研究验证其实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通常验证代码算法需要大量时间和资源，而本文旨在开发更快速有效的方法，以改善大型数据库研究中结果的可靠性分析。

Method: 提出了结合NLP减少人工审查时间及多阶段自适应抽样方法，在结果精确度足够时中止验证的策略。

Result: 使用NLP辅助减轻了40%的每张图表评审时间，而多阶段抽样方法节省了对77%图表的审查，同时精确度受限影响较小。

Conclusion: 该方法使得代码算法在数据库研究中的常规验证更为可行，从而提高从中得出的结果可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文重新定义了任意性，认为其是人类系统结构的基础性机制，并提出了新的理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统将任意性等同于不公的观点，探索其在系统功能中的积极作用。

Method: 以索绪尔符号学为基础，将任意性原理扩展到法律和社会动态，提出“动机-可验证性-可争论性”链条，并借助信息熵(A = H(L|M))进行了数学化形式化分析。

Result: 揭示任意性作为中立操作符在权力控制和关系关怀中的核心地位，并指出其如何通过结构性不透明性保护权威免于问责。

Conclusion: 论文构建了现代任意性理论，展示了其对人类社交系统及人工智能可解释性分析的新贡献。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

*Chengqian Ma,Wei Tao,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种综合基准数据集和基于大语言模型的评估方法，以探讨语音对话模型在处理复杂对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音对话模型（SDM）目前受关注，但对其实用性能的全面研究尚属欠缺，特别是与经过大规模基准测试的文本语言模型相比。

Method: 提供了一个包含英语和中文的1,079个实例的基准数据集，以及一个基于LLM的评估方法，用于分析语音对话模型的性能。

Result: 帮助研究人员评估SDM在处理语义多义性、语音特征及上下文依赖性等复杂语言挑战的表现。

Conclusion: 此工作为语音对话模型的后续研究奠定了重要基准，为其在实际场景中的改进提供了指导。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型(LLMs)处理数学自然语言推理任务的能力，构建了一个以数学文本为基础的新数据集，并考察了该领域模型的表现及一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代LLMs在数学文本的自然语言推理任务中的表现，以及研究如何改进相关模型和数据集以解决当前模型的问题。

Method: 构建了一套Math NLI语料库，包含人类提供的假设和金标准标签；也分析了由LLMs生成假设的语料库质量。此外，对比了LLMs在该任务上的表现与一致性。

Result: 正面发现包括在一些设置中，LLMs的多数投票结果能达到接近人类标注数据的水平；负面发现包括LLMs在处理数学语言时仍存在困难，偶尔在基本推理上出错，但比上一代模型更少依赖“仅基于假设”的推理。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学自然语言推理任务中有进步但仍需改进，研究提供了新的语料库以支持未来的进一步研究。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究领域通常需要针对特定任务微调模型，而本研究试图通过上下文学习方式简化流程，同时验证其在特定场景语义解析中的有效性。

Method: 构建自动生成的任务提示，其中包括框架定义和标注示例，通过FrameNet数据库指导六种不同的大语言模型的语义解析。

Result: 在与暴力事件相关的框架上，框架识别和语义角色标注分别达到了94.3%和77.4%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 上下文学习对于特定领域的语义解析任务来说，是一种实用且有效的替代传统微调方法的方案。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的上下文感知旋转位置嵌入（CARoPE），比现有RoPE方法在处理长句子时表现更好且效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）尽管具有相对位置编码的高效性，但由于其依赖静态、与输入无关的正弦频率模式，以至于无法有效建模上下文敏感的关系。

Method: CARoPE通过动态生成基于token嵌入的上下文相关频率模式，使用输入相关的相位偏移编码，并融入自注意力各头的旋转机制中。

Result: 实验使用FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集与GPT-2变体模型，表明CARoPE取得了显著更低的困惑度尤其在长上下文中表现更优，同时加速训练且保持模型稳定性。

Conclusion: CARoPE为现有的Transformer位置编码方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且表现力强的提升方式。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有模型只能进行局部编辑，难以保证全局一致性的挑战，提出一种能够在全局范围内进行一致性编辑的框架。

Method: 通过两个方法：1)推理时奖励引导的Refine，称为Reward-Refine；2)训练时基于奖励对齐布局对的偏好优化，称为RewardDPO。

Result: 在SMARTEdit-Bench基准测试中，SMART-Editor优于现有模型如InstructPix2Pix和HIVE。其中，RewardDPO在结构化场景中实现了15%的改进，而Reward-Refine在自然图像上表现优越。

Conclusion: 利用奖励引导的规划方法，SMART-Editor能够生成语义一致且视觉对齐的编辑结果，策略优势在自动和人工评估中均得以证实。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于大语言模型的自然语言数据库接口在扩展至企业规模数据目录时面临挑战，现有方法过于依赖领域特定的微调，且未充分利用数据库元数据中的语义信息。

Method: 研究提出了一种组件式检索架构，将数据库架构和元数据分解为离散语义单元，并分别索引以实现目标检索，注重表识别效率，并利用列级信息控制检索表数量。

Result: 该方法在对大规模结构差异和元数据多样性的数据库实验中表现出高召回率和准确性，性能优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种无需特定微调即可在多种企业环境中部署的文本到SQL系统，解决了自然语言数据库接口的关键可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

TL;DR: 本研究分析大语言模型(LLMs)面临中文文本歧义时的表现，发现其在处理语言歧义方面表现出显著的脆弱性，与实际人类理解行为存在较大差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前大语言模型在处理具有歧义的中文文本时的可靠性，尤其是在实际应用中涉及语义歧义的场景。

Method: 通过收集和生成包含歧义的中文句子及其消歧后的配对数据，构建一个系统化的基准数据集，并将其分类为9个子类别以进行实验分析。

Result: 实验发现，大语言模型难以正确辨别含歧义与无歧义的文本，对含歧义文本的单一解释表现出过度自信，同时在尝试理解多种可能含义时表现出过度思考。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在处理语言歧义方面存在根本性局限，呼吁开发改进的不确定性处理方法，以更好地满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub
repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

Motivation: 旨在解决多模态模型在真实环境中理解跨模态因果关系的挑战。

Method: 设计了ISO-Bench基准，通过图像和文本步骤的顺序判断，测评模型的因果推断能力。

Result: 评估发现目前的模型表现不佳，最好零样本F1仅为0.57，且思维链推理仅有小幅提升至0.62 F1，远低于人类表现（0.98 F1）。

Conclusion: 现有多模态模型在因果理解上存在显著不足，后续研究可从具体方向改进模型能力。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈具有潜力，但也存在局限性，具体表现取决于问题的复杂性和用户提示质量。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LENS的新方法，通过分析LLM的内部表示来估计模型信心，结果优于传统集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模型集成方法如投票和logits集成未充分考虑模型在不同上下文中的信心和可靠性，这限制了系统鲁棒性和性能的提高。

Method: 设计LENS方法，利用每个LLM的层级隐藏状态和归一化概率，通过线性信心预测器估计模型的上下文信心，无需修改模型参数，计算开销小。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务上，LENS方法显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为确定模型信心提供了重要信号，并可被高效地用于集成学习模型中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI生成GPU内核的需求，并提出了GEAK框架，展示其在基于Triton的GPU内核生成上的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增长，迫切需要自动化低层内核开发来提高性能和生产力。

Method: 提出GEAK框架，运用先进的大型语言模型(LLMs)生成高效的Triton代码，基于Reflexion风格的反馈机制进行推论计算扩展。

Result: GEAK在两个评估基准中显著优于其他方法，实现了高达63%的正确性与2.59倍的执行速度提升。

Conclusion: GEAK框架展示了通过代理式代码生成促进多样化硬件平台采用和实现专家级内核性能的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用负例样本增强Few-shot ICL性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Few-shot ICL性能对选取的样本敏感，之前的研究仅注重正例样本而忽略了负例样本中的信息。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正例和负例样本库，使用语义相似性方法分别从正例和负例中选取样本，结合负例匹配的正例构造为ICL示例。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于单凭正例相似性选取样本的方法。

Conclusion: 负例样本中的信息有助于通过改善正例样本选取来提升Few-shot ICL性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

*Carolina Zheng,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Sweta Karlekar,Claudia Shi,Achille Nazaret,Asif Mallik,Amir Feder,David M. Blei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的主题模型方法（MTMs），通过稀疏自编码器学习的解释性特征来定义主题，从而能捕捉更深层的概念和具象化特征，同时引入了一种新的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义上的抽象特征。而神经变体虽然使用更丰富的表示，但同样受到词列表表示的限制，其对复杂主题的表达能力有限。

Method: 提出了Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs)，通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）学习的解释性特征来定义主题，形成语义更丰富的表达。此外，还提出了一个基于大语言模型配对比较的主题评估框架“topic judge”。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统和神经基线持平或超越，并被“topic judge”中一致偏好，同时能有效地通过主题引导生成文本。

Conclusion: MTMs不仅可以捕捉复杂语义主题，还提供了可控的文本生成能力，是对现有主题模型的有力补充。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: 這篇文章提出了一種新框架TAP-GPT，利用改進的大型語言模型（如TableGPT2）進行阿爾茨海默症（AD）的精確診斷，並在小樣本數據中表現出優越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿爾茨海默症的精確早期診斷非常困難，其涉及多模態生物標誌物的分析，而傳統方法在有限數據下的預測能力有限，因此需要一種高效的解決方案。

Method: 提出了一個名為TAP-GPT的框架，改進TableGPT2模型，應用於結構化生物標誌數據。使用少樣本學習來構建提示，並通過qLoRA技術進行模型微調，實現對AD或正常認知（CN）的二分類任務。

Result: TAP-GPT結合了TableGPT2優化表格數據的能力和LLMs內嵌先驗知識，在AD預測任務中超越了一般用途的大型語言模型和針對表格設計的基礎模型(TFM)。

Conclusion: 該研究首次將大型語言模型應用於基於表格生物標誌數據的預測任務，為未來生物醫學信息學中的LLM驅動框架奠定了基礎。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Motivation: 孟加拉语在自然语言处理领域中被严重低估。研究者试图分析其独特的语言结构以及缺乏标准化评估基准如何影响孟加拉语的处理效果。

Method: 研究对10个开源的大语言模型在8个翻译数据集中的表现进行了评估，并进行了全面的错误分析，以发现模型性能下降的主要原因。

Result: 发现对于较小的模型和特定模型家族如Mistral，孟加拉语与英语性能表现存在显著差距。此外，某些架构如DeepSeek在跨语言环境中表现出较高的稳定性。额外发现高效的标记化与模型性能呈正相关，过度标记化导致表现下降。

Conclusion: 当前模型在处理孟加拉语的某些方面仍存在明显不足，需要改进数据集质量和设计适应多语言背景的评估方法。这项研究为欠发达语言的自然语言处理研究奠定了基础，并推动语言技术的公平普及。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

Motivation: 旨在深入了解稀疏激活专家模型（MoE LLMs）中专家重要性异质性，解决当前基于经验标准识别重要专家的不足。

Method: 通过分析MoE LLMs中专家的激活模式，发现和定义关键专家（SEs），并评估其在推理和任务表现中的重要性。此外，通过剪枝实验探索SEs对注意力分布和模型性能的影响。

Result: 表明SEs激活呈现极端超出模式，对模型推理过程中注意力分布和整体性能具有重大影响，尤其在数学推理任务上。

Conclusion: SEs是MoE LLMs的关键组件，对注意力引导和模型性能至关重要，它们的剪枝会显著影响模型输出表现。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Method: 通过实验分析GPT-4o-mini在改写敏感内容时的行为，并测试其在零样本环境下的敏感性分类能力，并与传统方法对比。

Result: 实验表明GPT-4o-mini会系统性地将内容调整为较不敏感的类别，大幅减少了冒犯性和禁忌语言；此外在敏感性分类任务中表现出了竞争力。

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini不仅隐式地执行内容调适，还具备良好的零样本敏感性分类能力，表明其在内容净化和敏感性评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

Motivation: 传统大型语言模型在音乐应用领域效果有限，因为训练数据中缺乏足够的音乐专业知识。

Method: 开发了MusT-RAG框架，通过音乐专用矢量数据库MusWikiDB检索上下文，并在推理与微调过程中应用上下文信息，以提升通用模型对音乐领域的适应能力。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG证明了结合检索增强生成技术和领域专用数据库，可以有效提升通用LLM在音乐领域的适应性和问答性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 当前任务导向对话系统依赖手动或监督学习生成的本体，但LLMs的内部知识不可解释且难以控制，因此需要一种新的方法自动生成具有可解释性和可控性的本体。

Method: TeQoDO结合大型语言模型的SQL编程能力和对话理论，无需监督即可从零开始构建任务导向对话本体。

Result: 实验显示，TeQoDO的生成结果优于迁移学习方法，其构造的本体在对话状态追踪任务上表现良好，并能应用于更大规模的本体构建。

Conclusion: TeQoDO在提升语言模型的可解释性方面迈出了重要一步，并为自动化任务导向对话本体的构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

Motivation: 当前多模态规划评估存在评估能力不足及缺乏多模态约束的挑战。

Method: 引入包括飞行、日历、会议规划在内的三种多模态任务，并在其中引入不同复杂级别的约束条件（如预算、时间和空间约束），形成MPCC基准。

Result: 实验表明，在常见多模态任务中，封闭源模型平均仅实现21.3%的可行规划，开源模型表现更差；传统策略无法应对多约束场景。

Conclusion: 本文提出了系统性的多模态约束定义与评估框架，同时强调现有模型需改进以支持多约束场景下的推理，多模态领域在实际应用中需进一步发展。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中因去除因果注意力屏蔽或引入额外输入文本导致解码器模型语义提取能力弱化以及计算成本增加的问题。

Method: 提出Causal2Vec，使用轻量化BERT模型生成可上下文化的Contextual token，并与LLM输入序列结合，同时修改嵌入生成策略以减少偏差。

Result: 在Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB)上，Causal2Vec在仅使用公开检索数据集训练的模型中实现了最佳性能，并将序列长度减少高达85%，推理时间缩短高达82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在保持LLM原有架构的情况下优化了嵌入性能且大幅降低计算成本，可广泛适用于解码器模型的改进。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

*Yongbing Zhang,Fang Nan,Shengxiang Gao,Yuxin Huang,Kaiwen Tan,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MRGSEM-Sum的框架，通过多关系图和结构熵最小化算法在无需监督的情况下实现多文档总结，实验中性能优于其他无监督方法，并接近监督模型和大语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多文档总结中文档间复杂关系及信息冗余的问题，现有方法多局限于单关系图及预定义聚类数，难以全面刻画丰富关系信息及自适应分组。

Method: 提出基于语义和篇章关系构建的多关系图，引入二维结构熵最小化算法自适应聚类，并通过位置感知压缩机制生成摘要。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有无监督方法，多数情况下与监督模型及大语言模型相当。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum模型在无监督多文档总结中展示了人类级别的摘要质量，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对阿拉伯语的改进Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)框架，采用新的关注相关性评分 (ARS) 方法，提高了语义匹配和检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语因复杂形态学、可选标点及现代标准阿拉伯语与各地方方言并存而对自然语言处理和信息检索产生挑战。同时，目前阿拉伯语在NLP研究和基准资源中有所不足。

Method: 提出一种名为ARS的自适应评分函数，取代标准交互模式，更有效地衡量问题与文本段落间的语义相关性，并结合预训练的阿拉伯语语言模型及框架改进。

Result: 新方法显著提升了阿拉伯语问题回答相关的检索性能和排名精度。

Conclusion: 本文的改进框架专为阿拉伯语设计，成效显著，并提供开源代码以供公众使用。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available
at \href{https://github.com/Bekhouche/APR}{GitHub}.

*Ante Wang,Yujie Lin,Jingyao Liu,Suhang Wu,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的积极批判思维范式，与以往仅仅拒绝问题的被动批判思维不同，新范式要求模型主动向用户寻求缺失的信息。作者创建了测试数学推理能力的GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个新基准，并通过实验展示了强化学习能极大地提升模型的这一能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在被动批判思维上，无法充分解决模型面对不完整或误导性信息时的能力不足问题。作者希望通过引入积极批判思维来弥补此短板。

Method: 本文提出了一种积极批判思维的新框架，并设计了GSM-MC和GSM-MCE基准来评估模型在不完整或误导条件下的数学推理能力，还通过强化学习优化算法改进模型性能。

Result: 在实验中，小模型在积极批判思维方面表现不佳，而大模型在强推理任务中表现优异。通过增强的强化学习算法，Qwen3-1.7B模型在GSM-MC基准上的准确率显著提升，从0.15%提高到73.98%。

Conclusion: 通过引入积极批判思维和加强的强化学习算法，本研究大幅提升了模型在面对不完整或误导性信息时的处理能力，有助于开发更能与用户协作解决问题的人工智能模型。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了是否可以通过微调大语言模型(LLMs)针对不同用户角色提供访问权限相关的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在企业环境中部署LLMs时，基于用户角色控制模型行为至关重要，现有方法大多仅关注防止有害或毒性输出，未考虑角色特定的访问约束。

Method: 研究了三种建模策略：基于BERT的分类器、基于LLM的分类器以及角色条件生成，并构建了两个数据集评估模型性能。

Result: 评估了模型在不同组织架构中的表现，包括对提示注入、角色不匹配及破解尝试的鲁棒性分析。

Conclusion: 通过方法验证了LLMs可通过微调在企业场景中生成符合角色访问权限的响应，满足企业应用需求。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）在临床决策支持中有潜力，但存在重大安全性和有效性验证的挑战。本研究提出了临床安全-有效性双轨基准（CSEDB），用于评估LLMs在医疗场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在医疗决策支持中的潜力与挑战并存，亟需一个标准化的框架进行验证与优化。

Method: 构建CSEDB框架，包含由临床专家共识制定的30项准则，涵盖关键领域；设计2069个开放式问答模拟真实场景，并对六种LLMs进行逐项测试。

Result: LLMs整体表现中等（安全性54.7%，有效性62.3%），高风险场景下表现下降13.3%。领域专用医疗LLMs在安全性和有效性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的CSEDB为评估医疗LLMs提供了标准化指标，有助于比较分析、风险识别和优化改进，从而推动其在医疗环境中的安全和有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

### [158] [Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23541)
*Keer Lu,Zheng Liang,Youquan Li,Jiejun Tan,Da Pan,Shusen Zhang,Guosheng Dong,Huang Leng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个医学检索增强推理框架Med-R$^3$，利用逐步强化学习联合优化检索和推理功能，实现了现有模型难以达到的高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多孤立地改进检索或推理能力，缺乏两者的有效协同优化。此外，依赖监督微调导致模型泛化能力欠佳，不适应新的医学情境。当前强化学习方法设计的奖励函数亦未能很好地满足医学领域的特要求。

Method: 提出Med-R$^3$框架，首先培养模型医学问题逻辑推理能力，然后基于此优化检索功能，使其更好地适配知识库特性和推理过程中的外部信息利用，最后联合优化检索与推理协调性。

Result: 实验表明，Med-R$^3$在多个任务上达到了最先进性能。如LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$超越了封闭源的GPT-4o-mini 3.93%。Qwen2.5-14B通过Med-R$^3$增强后更获得13.53%的显著提升。

Conclusion: Med-R$^3$通过深入优化医学检索和逻辑推理的协作潜力，在支持多参数模型时展示出卓越性能，表明其在提升医学AI解决方案上的广泛潜力。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的检测方法T-Detect，通过引入基于Student's t分布的重尾差异分数替代传统高斯正态化，从而提高对机器生成文本（尤其是对抗文本）的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本检测器对对抗文本和非母语英语文本的统计属性识别能力较差，因此需要开发一种更强大的检测方法。

Method: T-Detect提出使用以Student's t分布为核心的重尾差异分数来取代高斯正态化，通过计算文本段落对t分布期望矩的归一化对数似然值来检测文本。

Result: 在RAID对抗文本和HART数据集上验证，T-Detect在多个目标领域中AUROC平均提升3.9%，并在Books数据域达到0.926的AUROC，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种理论上有依据的新型统计基础方法，证明其在对抗性条件下的鲁棒性优越，方法经过消融试验验证，并成为当前检测领域的先进贡献。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at
https://github.com/ResearAI/t-detect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DiffLoRA的新方法，它是一种具有低秩适配器的差分注意力机制，目标是在保留LoRA效率的同时提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过在正负注意力项上引入低秩适配器，改进现有差分Transformer的噪声消除性能，同时保持LoRA的参数效率。

Method: 使用DiffLoRA结合低秩适配器，优化差分注意力机制，随后在多个NLP任务上对该方法进行评估测试。

Result: DiffLoRA在大多数任务中表现不如其他参数高效微调方法，但在某些领域（如HumanEval）表现出显著提升（+11分）。

Conclusion: 尽管在大多数任务中效果一般，但DiffLoRA在某些特定领域表现出了潜力，可以进一步分析其行为模式并优化实际应用。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体上仇恨言论的增多，迫切需要开发检测和清理此类文本的有效工具，尤其是在阿拉伯语领域。

Method: 本文利用深度学习模型和Transformer方法进行了仇恨言论检测实验，并将清理仇恨言论建模为机器翻译任务。

Result: 仇恨言论检测模型的Macro F1分数达到92%，准确率为95%。在清理仇恨言论方面，最佳模型取得了1-gram BLEU分数为0.3的成绩。

Conclusion: 研究表明，所提出的方法在仇恨言论检测和清理任务中表现出良好的效果，尤其是在阿拉伯语社交媒体文本处理中。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用大型语言模型生成适用于知识图谱逻辑规则的自然语言解释，并基于多种提示策略进行全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱中复杂的逻辑规则使得机器推断新事实十分困难，因此作者希望通过生成自然语言解释来提升知识图谱的可理解性与推理能力。

Method: 使用AMIE算法从数据集中提取逻辑规则，结合多种提示策略（如零样本、少样本提示和链式推理），并进行人工与自动评估。

Result: 实验表明生成的解释在正确性和清晰性方面表现出色，但仍面临若干挑战。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效生成知识图谱规则的自然语言解释，为提升知识图谱应用提供了新方向，但仍需进一步研究解决剩余问题。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新的测评大规模语言模型（LLMs）问题解决能力的方法，通过分阶段问题揭示方式，旨在比标准的问答基准评测方法更准确地了解LLMs的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前以问答基准为标准的方法是一种间接评估LLMs问题解决能力的方法，存在过于夸大模型性能差异的缺点，因此需要更全面且更具通用性的方法来评估模型能力。

Method: 使用分阶段问题揭示（cascaded question disclosure），设计逐步揭示部分问题信息的方法，旨在引导模型实现常规化的推理过程，同时保持测评的可扩展性与自动化。

Result: 该方法通过实验验证在多种推理和知识密集型的数据集上的有效性，证明其能更准确比较不同模型间的性能，同时发现标准问答方法可能夸大模型间性能差异。

Conclusion: 分阶段问题揭示法展现出比传统问答评估更优越的性能测评能力，弥合模型能力表现差异，也提高了模型的中间推理质量。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: 通过统一的框架和评估改进，该工作目标是使知识图谱完成领域中的可解释性研究更加可重复并具有影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探索了在多模态大语言模型中同时提升推理能力和减少社会偏见的平衡方法，提出了1:4的样本比例策略，将偏见降低10%，同时保持推理准确性的88%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，多模态大语言模型在众多任务和模态上表现优异，但其推理能力提升往往伴随着社会偏见的加重，亟需探索如何同时提高推理能力并减轻偏见的问题。

Method: 文章研究了三种偏见缓解策略（监督微调、知识蒸馏和基于规则的强化学习），通过实验比较它们各自的优劣，并尝试在不同比例下混合偏见缓解样本与推理样本，在强化学习框架下寻找推理与偏见缓解的最佳平衡点。

Result: 研究发现，在样本比例为1:4时，通过强化学习可以将偏见分数削减10%，同时保留模型原有推理准确性的88%。

Conclusion: 通过合理调整偏见缓解样本与推理样本比例，可以在多模态大语言模型中实现推理能力和减少偏见的双赢，为模型开发者提供了具体的指导方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究证明当前AI系统在处理人类轻松完成的听觉任务时会彻底失败，并提出了一种由917种挑战组成的听觉图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机在于揭示人工智能在处理复杂听觉场景时的局限性，并提出诊断框架以推动机器听觉接近人类水平。

Method: 研究通过设计一个包括重叠语音、噪声语音、时间扭曲、空间音频等七类任务的测试基准，评估了包括GPT-4音频功能和OpenAI Whisper在内的最新音频模型表现。

Result: 当前最先进的音频模型在测试中失败率超过93%，其中表现最好模型的准确率仅为6.9%，远低于人类的52%。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前AI架构缺乏实现人类水平听觉场景分析的基础机制，并需要整合选择性注意、基于物理的音频理解及上下文感知的新方法以改进多模态智能系统。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 本论文提出一种预测的一致性属性，主要涉及论证一致性在预测中的应用研究，并评估了其在提高预测准确性方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预测过程中论证一致性的重要性并探讨其通过过滤不一致性以提升人和LLM模型预测的准确性潜力。

Method: 正式定义论证一致性的概念，并通过分析人类和LLM模型预测中的一致性，然后进行实际和用户实验，评估一致性在预测中的应用效果。

Result: 结果表明，过滤掉不一致的预测可以显著提高预测准确性，但用户通常不能自然地认同一致性标准。

Conclusion: 验证了一致性的价值，建议在基于论证的预测系统中，引入过滤不一致的机制，以增强最终预测质量。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

TL;DR: 本文探讨论文查询回答中的责任度量计算复杂性，重点研究基于Shapley值的责任度量WSMS的计算，发现其在某些可简化为一阶逻辑的查询中具有多项式数据复杂性，而在更复杂的本体语言下可能变得困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究定量解释查询答案的有效方法，为不同事实贡献量化提供理论支持，优化查询处理。

Method: 结合数据库与本体查询的理论，分析WSMS计算的复杂性，通过研究不同查询类型下的算法表现辨清计算可行性。

Result: 发现特定本体语言支持的查询具有较高复杂性，而在受限的结构化查询、DL-Lite语言下某些查询类别中，计算可以做到可行。

Conclusion: 该研究明确了基于WSMS责任度量的计算复杂性边界，为理解如何在不同情景下高效地进行算法设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分而治之的方法，通过许多小型的部分MILP调用来解决复杂实例的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的方法在选择重要的ReLU变量时效果欠佳，因此提出更高效的方法改进此问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于解决方案的ReLU评分（SAS）方法，并对BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数进行调整作为全局ReLU评分（GS）函数。

Result: SAS减少了6倍的二元变量数量，同时保持了同样的准确度；实现的杂交MILP验证器将未决实例减少了最多40%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效准确的验证器，适用于包括大型CNN在内的模型。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve

Result: 文章从理论探讨、论证反驳和证据支撑各方面表明，完全自主的人工智能存在极大风险，需确保负责任的人类监督。

Conclusion: 论文表明，人工智能必须在负责任的人类监督下运行，而不能完全自动化，以有效降低风险，这是确保技术对社会有益的核心原则。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Result: 新管道比传统方法性能提高近三倍。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型在因果推理中具有明显优势，但需结合精心设计的上下文框架才能最大化其能力，对于跨领域的因果发现具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Method: 提出了一种因果解释方法及其形式化定义，并进一步引入对比因果解释和信心水平相关的完整因果解释，算法完全是黑盒的，无需模型内部知识或任何假设。

Result: 实验表明，不同模型的充足性、对比性和完整性模式各异，提出的解释算法平均每张图片计算时间为6秒，并验证了解释方法的高效性和适用性。

Conclusion: 因果解释不仅保持了逻辑解释的形式化性质，还适用于黑盒图像分类器，在实现高效计算的同时，为图像模型的解释性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过策略引导的代理记忆辅助方法MemoCue，用于改进人机交互中的记忆回忆表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的代理记忆方法受限于存储模块大小，无法有效帮助使用者完全回忆模糊或不完整记忆。记忆理论表明，可以通过有效线索主动激活相关记忆，这成为了工作的主要驱动力。

Method: 提出Recall Router框架，包括5W Recall Map分类和策略模式定义，并使用蒙特卡罗树搜索算法优化策略选择与响应生成。开发MemoCue工具，通过开放语言模型的微调来支持基于记忆的响应。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明MemoCue比基于LLM的方法在记忆回忆灵感方面高出17.74%。人类评估进一步证明了MemoCue在记忆回忆应用场景中的优势。

Conclusion: 通过策略指导改进了代理协助的记忆回忆方法，为不同的遗忘场景提供了更高效的解决方案。这种方法在实验中得到了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在个性化问题推荐中存在效率不足的问题，即在有限的训练中无法识别出适合每个学生的最佳问题。

Method: RAR方法将协同理念融入探索机制，提升了基于强化学习问题推荐器的探索效率。

Result: 实验表明RAR方法显著提升了推荐效果，并且该框架适用于任何基于强化学习的题目推荐器。

Conclusion: RAR方法改进了个性化问题推荐的性能，并具有普遍适用性。代码已开源以供验证和使用。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TextQuests的新基准，通过基于交互式小说游戏来评估AI代理在探索性环境中的长时间问题解决能力和持久推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试虽然能评估AI在工具使用或结构化任务上的能力，但无法全面反映其在探索性环境中自主解决问题的能力。因此，提出新的基准测试方法势在必行。

Method: 利用Infocom系列交互式小说游戏作为测试基础，这些游戏需要上百个精确行为来解决问题，并禁止使用外部工具，以此评估AI在长时间状态关联环境中的内在推理能力。

Result: TextQuests基准测试能够有效地对AI的长时间问题解决能力进行评估，并要求其掌握试错法和持久推理能力。

Conclusion: TextQuests为研究AI在长时段探索性任务中的自我解决能力提供了新的评价框架，推动了基于内在推理的AI能力发展。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: 提出了Seed-Prover，通过形式化验证和长链式推理显著提升了自动数学推理的性能，包括解决IMO级别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在数学定理证明领域因缺乏明确的监督信号而表现不佳，而形式化语言如Lean提供了一种解决上述问题的可能性。

Method: 提出了一种基于Lean的证明模型Seed-Prover，结合反馈优化、自我总结和证明的引理，对数学问题进行逐步推导解决。同时设计了三种推理策略扩展推导能力，并引入了专为几何问题设计的Seed-Geometry引擎。

Result: Seed-Prover在78.1%的以往IMO问题中取得成功，显著优于之前的状态基准；参与IMO 2025并完全解决5个问题；Seed-Geometry在几何推理任务上超越了之前的形式化工具。

Conclusion: 结合形式验证和长链式推理的模型可以大幅提升数学自动化推理性能，同时为几何等特殊领域的未来研究提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: 在可验证推理任务中，合成数据在MATH500、AMC23、AIME24和GPQA-Diamond等数据集上明显优于s1k与OpenMathReasoning。在非可验证指令任务中，也超过了AlpacaEval 2.0与Arena-Hard评价中人类及传统方法的表现。

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct方法显著改进了LLM训练数据质量，并展示了其在多种任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0

Motivation: 目前的 AI 代理普遍采用单任务单代理的方法，面临可扩展性和通用性不足以及自回归语言模型固有局限性的问题。而人类可以通过模拟结果进行推理，成为更通用的智能代理。

Result: 在困难的 Web 浏览任务中，SimuRA 将飞行搜索的成功率从 0% 提高到 32.2%，并显示基于世界模型的规划比自回归规划有显著优势，最高可提升 124%。

Conclusion: SimuRA 展示了基于大语言模型的一个通用智能代理模型的潜力，其基于世界模型的推理范式是一种更强大的推理路径，为构建能在所有环境中表现超智的单一通用代理模型提供了可能性。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Motivation: 当前处理大脑老化合成需应对高维数据、微妙年龄相关变化及个体化模式等挑战，因此需要一种有效的预测模型。

Method: 利用生成性自回归变压器，NeuroAR通过离散的令牌映射实现未来大脑扫描的逐步预测，并结合前一阶段和目标阶段的扫描数据和年龄信息进行制导生成。

Result: 在老年及青少年大脑老化预测上，NeuroAR在图像逼真度上优于状态最先进的生成模型（如LDM和GAN），并表现出更高的一致性与真实性。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能高保真地模拟个体化的大脑老化轨迹，是当前技术上的新突破，具有潜在的临床和计算神经科学应用价值。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Motivation: 解决以往研究对语言范围、认知背景和LLM参与程度细化不足的问题，专注于韩语写作中的击键动态特征以检测LLM辅助作弊。

Method: 构建包括69名参与者的实验数据集，参与者在真写作、ChatGPT答案改写和ChatGPT答案转录三个条件下完成写作任务；提取可解释的时间和节奏特征，并在Cognition-Aware和Cognition-Unaware两种场景下评估多种分类器表现。

Conclusion: 击键动态是区分LLM辅助写作的可靠依据，可适用于不同认知需求和写作策略下的检测场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Method: 从数据驱动学习、物理信息建模和深度算子学习三个角度对KAN模型的进展进行分类与分析，包括网络设计、训练策略及与MLPs的对比评估。

Conclusion: 尽管KAN在复杂动力学建模方面表现出色，但仍存在计算效率、理论保障、参数调优及算法复杂性等挑战，未来需在鲁棒性、可扩展性和物理一致性上进一步优化。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

Method: 通过整合地形数据、高分辨率土地覆盖数据和气象条件，基于动态条件化FiLM架构，设计深度学习框架GSM-UTCI，利用SOLWEIG生成的数据训练模型。

Result: GSM-UTCI模型在城市范围内实现高精度预测，R2达0.9151，MAE为0.41°C，并将计算时间从数小时减少到5分钟以下。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI可作为一种高效的城市气候适应决策支持工具，帮助评估绿化策略对热暴露的影响，并优化城市规划。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Conclusion: 强调当前使用人类测试评估AI的不足，呼吁为AI开发独立且有效的测评体系以更准确地反映AI系统的特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

### [194] [Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010)
*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了跨模态任务模型的逆向能力，发现多模态潜在空间难以支持语义和感知一致的逆向映射。尽管优化可以执行逆向任务，但输出表现混乱且不连贯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨任务特定AI模型的多模态潜在空间是否能够用于逆向映射，以挖掘其未利用的潜力并发现其局限性。

Method: 提出了一种基于优化的框架，在文本-图像和文本-音频模态中进行双向逆向任务探索，验证模型在潜在空间逆向映射上的表现。

Result: 实验表明通过优化可以实现与目标文本对齐的输出，但由于潜在空间结构问题，结果在感知质量和语义一致性上表现不佳，且潜在空间的重建缺乏语义解释性。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态潜在空间并不适合稳健且可解释的逆向映射，此类模型需要针对语义丰富和可逆性改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型推理中的内存与计算需求难题，并提高传统量化方法在低精度下的准确性，克服激活量化中的离群值问题。

Method: 提出KLLM框架，通过基于索引的计算方案高效执行K-Means量化矩阵操作，同时设计Orizuru引擎在线高效检测激活数据流中的离群值。

Result: KLLM在实验中实现了相较于A100 GPU和Atom平均9.67x、7.03x的加速效果，并实现了229.50x和150.21x的能效提升。

Conclusion: KLLM框架在不显著损失模型准确性的前提下，充分释放了K-Means量化在大型语言模型推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于个体行为和时序数据的方法，可更深入地理解行为对流程效率的影响，为流程挖掘提供新的视角。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Motivation: 早期预测ICU使用万古霉素患者的肾损伤风险具有挑战性。

Method: 分析了10,288名使用万古霉素的ICU患者数据，通过特征选择（SelectKBest及随机森林）和6种机器学习算法测试（5折交叉验证），采用SHAP等工具评价解释性。

Result: 28.2%的患者出现肌酐升高，CatBoost表现最佳，磷、总胆红素、镁等为关键预测因子。

Conclusion: 该模型可高效预测万古霉素相关的肌酐升高风险，具有良好的准确性和解释性，为重症监护提供支持。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between

relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标上提升32.06%，视觉保真度提升31.42%，优于线性方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个生成每日10米高分辨率LST的非线性方法，为解决卫星分辨率权衡问题提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

Conclusion: 该技术适用于多种编程语言和数学库，不需修改现存代码，同时提出的高级策略显著改进了稀疏性检测算法的时间复杂度和工程实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了DocsRay，一种无需训练的文档理解系统，通过伪目录生成与分层检索增强生成方法提升文档处理效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的多模态文档因其结构不一致性和训练数据不足而难以理解，因此有必要开发一种无需特殊模型或额外训练的新方法。

Method: DocsRay基于多模态大语言模型，采用三大技术：伪目录生成、零样本文档元素统一表征与两阶段分层检索，简化复杂度并提升效率。

Result: 在平均49.4页的长文档上，DocsRay将查询延迟缩短45%，并在MMLongBench-Doc基准上实现64.7%的准确率，超越之前的最佳表现。

Conclusion: DocsRay无需训练即可有效支持长文档的多模态分析，展示了在精确性和效率方面的显著优势。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无生成器依赖的观察者模型，通过单次前向传播及线性探测，有效检测AI语言模型的语境幻觉。实验结果表明该方法性能显著优于基准，并能操纵生成器幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语境幻觉是AI语言模型的核心挑战之一，作者希望开发一种可解释性强的方法检测并缓解这一问题。

Method: 利用观察者模型，通过该模型的残差流再加上线性探测分离出幻觉与真实文本之间的可转移线性方向，同时通过梯度和激活定位此信号来源于为稀疏的晚层MLP活动。

Result: 该方法在多个模型上表现出色，相比基准提升了5-27分，并成功证明了操控生成器幻觉率的可行性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种独特的检测与缓解AI生成器语境幻觉的方法，其低维信号与特定MLP子电路相关，同时发布ContraTales基准数据集供评估使用。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的机器学习“遗忘”方法，称为影响近似遗忘（IAU），能够实现快速且准确的数据删除，而无需繁琐的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着隐私问题的日益关注，如何让机器学习模型“遗忘”特定训练数据成为一个重要课题。

Method: 从增量学习的角度出发，将“记忆”和“遗忘”建立理论连接，提出影响近似遗忘（IAU）算法，避免传统方法中昂贵的Hessian矩阵计算。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在删除保证、遗忘效率和模型效用性之间取得了优秀的平衡，并在多种数据集和模型架构中超越了最新方法。

Conclusion: IAU提供了一种高效、实用的解决数据遗忘问题的新方法，为机器学习中的隐私保护提供新的方向。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSwarm 通过动态调整图结构，优化 LLM 多智能体系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数多智能体系统依赖于手动设计和静态的协作图结构，这限制了系统的适应性和性能。

Method: 提出使用Actor-Critic强化学习机制优化图结构，提升稳定性；同时设计动态图选择器，根据输入样本动态调整图结构，并通过参数高效的LLM微调来实现。

Result: DynaSwarm 在问答、数学推理、编程任务上均优于现有的单智能体和多智能体基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究显示，在LLM多智能体系统设计中，具有样本感知动态灵活性的结构更为重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有的成员推断攻击研究中，虽然攻击方法取得了进展，但对深度学习模型在训练过程中的隐私信息编码方式仍缺乏深入理解，因此需要研究与量化隐私泄露的动态变化。

Method: 提出了一个动态分析框架，能够在训练过程中通过FPR-TPR平面上的样本跟踪来评估隐私风险，分析数据集复杂性、模型架构和优化器选择对样本暴露的影响。

Result: 发现样本的内在学习难度与隐私风险之间有显著关联，且高风险样本隐私主要由早期训练阶段决定。

Conclusion: 研究为理解隐私风险如何动态形成提供了指南，并为隐私敏感的模型训练策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: 此API及实现显著简化了序列模型的构建过程，同时保证了正确性和可扩展性，适合流式和并行序列处理。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Conclusion: 研究为NBP领域拓宽了新任务形式，通过引入可解释的算法为遗忘商品的预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 此研究提出过程奖励模型（PRMs）以加速大规模推理模型（LRMs）的强化学习训练，创新性地引入基于思考层级的生成过程评估机制，显著提升数学推理任务的训练效率和问题解决准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LRMs解决复杂数学问题时效率较低，主要因为传统强化学习方法的奖励机制稀疏且依赖于最终结果，导致优化过程缓慢。研究动机是通过改进奖励机制来提升训练效率。

Method: 引入一种基于思考层级的生成过程评估机制，利用内在信号评估逐步正确性，将连续正确/错误步骤聚合为完整的'思考'单元，并通过能力自适应奖励机制动态平衡探索与利用，减轻奖励欺骗问题。同时结合这些机制开发新的离策略强化学习算法TP-GRPO。

Result: 该方法在1.5B和7B参数规模的LRMs上实验，显示比基于结果的奖励机制需要更少训练样本即能达到更高的数学问题解决准确率，验证了过程奖励的有效性。

Conclusion: 结构良好的过程奖励可以显著加速LRMs在数学推理任务上的优化，且新算法TP-GRPO在效率和能力提升上表现卓越。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is
available at https://github.com/cs-holder/tp_grpo.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的认证恢复防御方法CostCert，用于对抗向深度学习系统发起的对抗性补丁攻击问题，并显著提升了现有防御技术的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击防御技术在处理 top-k 预测时，存在攻击者票数膨胀和组合爆炸问题，无法精准认证单一真实标签。因此需要新的解决方案来克服这一挑战。

Method: 引入CostCert，一种基于投票的认证恢复方法，通过设计预算模型，验证攻击预算是否足以将真实标签从 top-k 预测中排除，避免了配对比较和组合爆炸问题。

Result: 实验表明，在补丁大小为96时，CostCert的认证准确率达到了57.3%，显著优于现有的PatchGuard方法（其准确率降至零）。

Conclusion: CostCert能够有效应对对抗性补丁攻击，在top-k预测验证中表现出高扩展性和精确性，证明了一种更强大的认证恢复能力。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有高效性与准确性，可显著改善共享单车系统的库存平衡问题，降低运营成本，同时强调了设定恰当初始条件对成本优化的重要性。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: PLARE能够以更低的成本实现离线强化学习的高效性，证明其在实际操作中的潜在适用性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

system comprises three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) spectral information of pure and contaminated coconut milk samples.
Findings show that the proposed method successfully detects adulteration with a
cross-validation accuracy of 93.33%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有方法对空间与时间耦合维度建模的限制，提出高效分解方案以更好处理偏微分方程中的复杂动力学问题。

Method: 设计了结构化状态空间模型，独立建模时间演化与空间交互，并证明了SSMs与神经算子之间的理论联系，提出通用性定理，验证了其对PDE基准问题的性能提升。

Result: 在多个PDE基准问题（如1D Burgers方程、1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程、2D Navier-Stokes方程）中的结果显示，该方案在参数显著减少的情况下仍可竞争性表现优秀。

Conclusion: 支持通过时空维度分解进行高效、广泛适用的PDE建模，进一步巩固了此方向的理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

TL;DR: Coflex是一种新提出的硬件感知神经结构搜索（HW-NAS）框架，通过结合稀疏高斯过程和多目标贝叶斯优化提高性能，并显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HW-NAS尽管能够优化神经网络性能和硬件能效，但受制于搜索空间过大和计算成本过高的问题，亟需开发高效的解决方案。

Method: Coflex通过集成稀疏高斯过程和多目标贝叶斯优化，利用稀疏诱导点将高斯过程内核复杂性从三次减少到接近线性，从而缩小计算开销并兼顾预测精度。

Result: Coflex在多种基准测试中表现出色，在网络准确性和能量延迟产品方面优于最新方法，同时实现了1.9至9.5倍的计算加速。

Conclusion: Coflex是一种高效的HW-NAS框架，可在大规模搜索空间中提供高预测精度，解决了HW-NAS的实用性挑战。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Motivation: 为了解决如何更好地个性化诊断和优化2型糖尿病患者治疗策略的问题。

Method: 分析554名2型糖尿病患者的数据，利用机器学习模型（尤其是额外存活树模型）预测死亡风险，并通过SHAP方法解释模型的决策过程。

Result: 额外存活树模型基于10个关键特征，实现0.776的C统计值和高AUC值（分别为0.86、0.80、0.841和0.826）。

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨因果结构的不确定性对决策影响的重要性，并提出在某些情况下通过贝叶斯模型平均化方法应对这种不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果推断中的结构不确定性常被忽视，该研究旨在分析何种情况下这种不确定性需要被系统地解决，以辅助决策。

Method: 重点关注二元因果关系（$X \rightarrow Y$ 和 $X \leftarrow Y$），结合数学证明和模拟实验，提出基于贝叶斯模型平均的优化方法，在一定正则条件下展示其优越性。

Result: 研究发现，当结构不确定性高、因果效应显著不同且损失函数对因果效应敏感时，贝叶斯模型平均方法效果明显优于单一模型选择。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了量化因果结构不确定性的方法，与现有因果推断方法互补，有助于解决实践中被忽视的关键不确定性问题。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

### [228] [Directional Ensemble Aggregation for Actor-Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23501)
*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的$Q$值估计集合方法——Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA)，以提高离线强化学习在连续控制任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中通过集合保守聚合（例如取最小值）来减轻过估偏差，但这些静态方法过于粗糙，丢弃了有价值的信息，无法适应不同任务需求和学习阶段。

Method: DEA在actor-critic框架下引入了两个可学习的方向性参数，一个调节评论者的保守性，另一个引导行为者的策略探索。这些参数通过基于集合分歧权重的贝尔曼误差进行学习，自适应地根据不确定性和训练阶段调整聚合方式。

Result: DEA在连续控制基准测试和不同学习阶段中展示出了比静态集合策略更好的效果，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本方法以数据驱动的方式动态调整保守性和探索，显著提升了强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Method: 通过形式化定理（验证器权衡定理）分析验证时间与认证长度之间的关系，并将其应用在复杂性类分离及自然问题研究中。

Result: 提出验证器权衡定理，展示其对复杂性分类分离和特定问题分析效果。此外，提供关于P和NP问题的独特视角。

Conclusion: 缩短验证时间会付出认证长度的代价，并且这种关系能够帮助分析复杂性分类和难题的性质。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决传统高概率收敛分析对裁剪阈值不断增加的依赖，从而使其与差分隐私机制兼容。

Method: 将固定裁剪水平适用于DP-Clipped-SGD算法，并在重尾噪声和特定平滑条件下进行高概率收敛分析。

Result: 证明了固定裁剪水平的DP-Clipped-SGD在凸和平滑非凸优化问题中能以更快的速度收敛至目标解附近，同时平衡了收敛速度与隐私保护之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 此方法改进了收敛性分析的鲁棒性，使得固定裁剪阈值可实现更高效的优化和差分隐私保障。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Experience Blending的新框架，通过引入合成边界数据（SBD）来缓解连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前连续学习方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，而现有基于经验回放的方法由于存储样本分布稀疏，导致决策边界过于简化，难以有效提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 论文提出Experience Blending框架，其核心是通过多变量差分隐私噪声机制在低维特征中生成合成边界数据（SBD），并与存储的关键样本一起用于训练，从而增强决策边界的稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上，与九种连续学习基线方法相比，提出的方法分别提升了10%、6%和13%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过Experience Blending框架，即通过引入合成边界数据，能够有效缓解灾难性遗忘，并显著提升连续学习模型的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Result: PEFT方法在深度可分离卷积中效率下降，但在优化边缘部署的卷积架构中通过适配器方式实现FLOPs减少达95%。

Conclusion: 不同PEFT方法的选择需综合硬件限制、性能需求和应用场景，为边缘部署提供了有益指导。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range

then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements

Motivation: 解决高维数据中特征选择的挑战，尤其是在模型稀疏性、可解释性与性能均有需求的情况下。

Method: 应用模拟退火算法进行全局搜索，通过Fisher判别率作为优化目标函数来评估特征子集的分类质量。

Result: 实验表明，SA-FDR可以在数十万样本和数百特征的数据中选出紧凑、高效的特征子集，并达到较高的分类准确率。

Conclusion: SA-FDR能够捕捉特征间的依赖关系，较传统贪心优化方法更具优势，是高维数据中设计可解释模型的有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

### [238] [EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23600)
*Yu-Tang Chang,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 文中提出了一种新的能量驱动生成性MCR方法（EB-gMCR），通过深度学习实现大规模信号分离，并解决了传统方法在分辨成分数量方面的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号解混在化学和生物学中具有重要作用，但传统MCR方法的可扩展性和准确性在大规模数据处理与成分数量未知时面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种生成性MCR模型（gMCR），并开发了一个基于能量的深度学习解算器（EB-gMCR），通过一个差分门控网络在候选成分池中自动选择最小成分集，同时估算其浓度。

Result: 在包含高达256个潜在源的噪声合成数据集上，EB-gMCR在R^2 >= 0.98的情况下准确估算了成分数，并在低噪声条件下实现了R^2 >= 0.99的几乎精确估算。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合了高容量生成建模与智能成分选择，提供了可扩展的大规模信号分离分析方法，其灵活性也使其适用于多个领域。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，将消息传递与分层强化学习相结合，构建多智能体分层策略。通过图结构协调和新颖的奖励分配方法，表现优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有去中心化多智能体强化学习方法因部分观测性和非平稳性的问题，难以实现高效协调与高水平规划。结合通信与分层强化学习有潜力解决这些挑战，但优化问题阻碍了其在多智能体系统中的应用。此外，这两种方法的整合未被充分探索。

Conclusion: 通过整合分层强化学习和消息传递，提出了一个高效的多智能体分层策略学习方法，显示出优越性能。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Motivation: 临床试验需要高成本和精确规划，而患者招募的准确预测是计划阶段的主要挑战之一。

Method: 研究提出了一种结合预训练语言模型和注意力机制的神经网络，并引入了基于Gamma分布的概率层来实现患者招募预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测给定临床试验中多个试验点的患者招募人数方面优于传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 利用深度学习模型实现的患者招募预测方法具有更高的准确性，为临床试验规划提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Conclusion: L-GTA模型具备将基本变换复合以生成复杂合成数据的特点，是改进时间序列分析性能的一种有效方法。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种方法，将softmax注意力机制以递归神经网络（RNN）的形式重述，旨在解释其对其他注意力机制的表现优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的softmax注意力机制虽然在各种任务上具有较强的表现力，但其内存和计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次增长，因此研究如何改进该机制以及理解其优势成为重要课题。

Method: 通过对softmax注意力机制的递归形式进行推导，将其用递归神经网络的语言进行描述，并分析其内部组件的重要性及其交互方式。

Result: 证明了线性注意力是softmax注意力的近似形式，揭示了softmax注意力在表达能力上的优势。

Conclusion: 通过将softmax注意力机制表述为递归神经网络形式，不仅解释了其优越表现的原因，还为以后优化注意力机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust 和 FedBN-Prox 框架有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性和精度，尤其在数据异质性和拜占庭攻击场景下表现优越，具有较强应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Result: TweakLLM在保持响应质量的同时，显著提升了缓存系统的效率。

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种高效可扩展的解决方案，可为大规模LLM部署提供资源优化，同时确保用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，所提算法表现出与扩散策略基线相当的性能，且推理时所需的函数评估次数减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD在提高推理效率的同时保持了强大的性能，适合在线强化学习场景。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Motivation: 解决微生物组数据中稀疏性和噪声对下游任务造成阻碍的挑战，如生物标志物发现等。

Method: 结合扩散生成模型与依赖感知Transformer (DAT)，引入了VAE预训练和基于大型语言模型(LLM)的患者元数据条件增强。

Result: 在TCGA微生物组数据集上表现显著优于现有方法，Pearson相关性最高达0.712，余弦相似性达0.812，同时降低了RMSE和MAE。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff具有较强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是一种改进微生物组数据插补的新型有效解决方案。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Conclusion: 即使在少量样本的环境中，合理利用异常样本可以显著提升检测效果，同时优化分数整合技术能够进一步提高模型性能。

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: 通过结合标注者的内部因素优化主动学习过程的方法初步验证了其可行性，为研究认知因素对主动学习的影响提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Conclusion: CODA提供了一种高效的主动模型选择方法，从而在多个任务中节省了大量的人力和时间成本，并展示了卓越的性能。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

### [254] [Rethink Domain Generalization in Heterogeneous Sequence MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23110)

TL;DR: 本文提出了PancreasDG，一个多中心3D MRI胰腺分割的基准数据集，旨在解决医学影像领域的域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前胰腺分割面临的挑战是由于胰腺小且形状不规则，且其影像对比度较低。此外，现有的域泛化研究主要关注跨中心变化，忽略了序列间的差异，而胰腺在已有基准测试中还处于严重代表不足的状态。

Method: 研究采用563例来自六个机构的MRI扫描数据集，覆盖不同扫描序列，并提供高精度的手工标签，用于分析域泛化问题与设计新的半监督方法。

Result: 通过分析，明确了数据采样导致的误差与跨中心性能表现的相关性，同时提出的半监督方法在跨序列分割任务中显著优于现有技术，达到了更高的Dice得分。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像中的域泛化研究设立了新的基准，其开源的数据与代码为进一步研究提供了便利，同时也凸显了序列间变化在影像分析中的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at
https://pancreasdg.netlify.app.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
