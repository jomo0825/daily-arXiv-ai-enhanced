Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

### [2] [Learning to Generate Vectorized Maps at Intersections with Multiple Roadside Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02899)
*Miao Fan,Quanxin Zheng,Shengtong Xu,Linghe Kong,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRC-VMap是一种视觉为中心的端到端神经网络，用于在复杂路口直接生成矢量化地图，使用多方向监控摄像头图像，性能接近昂贵的LiDAR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地图生成方法存在昂贵设备需求或性能局限，尤其在复杂路口，需找到更经济高效的方案。

Method: 引入MRC-VMap，通过监控摄像头图像，直接生成矢量地图，无需额外特征提取和BEV转换模块，减轻计算负担并减少误差传播。

Result: 在中国4大都市的4000个路口实验表明，MRC-VMap优于最先进在线方法，且接近于高成本LiDAR方法的准确性。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap提供了一种具有成本效益、扩展性且高效的现代自动导航系统解决方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Method: 评估MLLMs在网球动作分类及回合事件序列处理中的表现，同时尝试改进其性能，如不同训练方法及与传统模型的结合。

Result: 初步结果表明MLLMs在网球视频分析中展现了潜力，但仍需进一步优化以增强事件识别能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs可用于网球视频事件分析，并为体育分析拓展新可能性，但需通过改进训练和模型结合以达到更优效果。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过街景图像克服现有调查数据方法的可扩展性限制。

Method: 提出一个两步法，包括特征提取和门控注意力机制进行图像聚合，并与其他模型架构比较其有效性。

Result: 模型表现略逊于预测能力，但表现出对现有粮食不安全识别方法的补充潜力。

Conclusion: 尽管预测能力略有不足，该方法仍可能为城市规划者和政策制定者提供额外支持。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

Motivation: 改善在开放世界和高仿真环境中的自主环境理解能力。

Method: 利用OBSER框架，通过度量学习和自监督学习模型，在隐空间中估算子环境的对象分布，并引入(ε,δ)统计可分性函数来验证表示对齐情况。

Result: 该框架在开放世界和高仿真环境中表现可靠，在链式检索任务上超过基于场景的方法，并实现对环境的零样本识别。

Conclusion: OBSER框架为自主环境理解提供了新方法，并在理论和实践上验证了其实用性。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

### [8] [GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941)
*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet 是一个低分辨率游戏瓦片的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工智能生成的游戏视觉内容常常与游戏叙事不一致，生成内容需手动调整，且内容多样性受限，亟需改进。

Method: 通过从 OpenGameArt.org 网站中收集艺术家创作的游戏瓦片，并为其提供语义标注，包括接续性和对象分类等，形成数据集并提供低分辨率瓦片艺术对象检测的处理流程。

Result: 创建了一个支持叙事驱动内容生成的语义数据集，对低分辨率和非写实图像中的对象检测提供基线支持。

Conclusion: GameTileNet 数据集为改进程序内容生成方法、支持叙事型游戏内容及低分辨率图像对象检测提供了重要资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

### [9] [Iterative Zoom-In: Temporal Interval Exploration for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02946)
*Chenglin Li,Qianglong Chen,fengtao,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入了Temporal Search (TS)，一个训练无关的框架，用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）更有效地理解长视频的时间区域，提高任务相关信息的识别能力。通过TS-BFS搜索策略进一步提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频理解任务中表现强劲，但对长视频的时间间隔感知能力不足，无法动态调整时间焦点，导致高内存消耗和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Temporal Search框架：模型通过生成置信度识别相关时间区域，进行迭代分析。引入TS-BFS（Best-First Search）策略，基于置信分数和自评估分数选择最优节点进行探索。

Result: TS能够有效改善MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，优化时间焦点并降低内存消耗。同时，TS-BFS进一步增强了搜索效率。

Conclusion: Temporal Search为MLLMs理解长视频提供了一种高效的时间区域分析方法，通过迭代和最佳优先搜索策略优化了信息提取和推理过程。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主驾驶面临长尾场景中预测自车未来运动安全的重大挑战，研究旨在探索如何通过视觉语言模型和合成高风险数据来克服动态环境中的不确定性和数据覆盖限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于鸟瞰视角的运动模拟方法，从自车、其他车辆和环境三个方面建模风险，生成高风险运动数据。构建了一个与VLM无关的框架DriveMRP-Agent，并通过全局上下文、自车视角及轨迹投影的全新信息注入策略，增强模型预测空间关系的能力。

Result: 在DriveMRP-10K数据集上微调后，DriveMRP-Agent显著提升了多种VLM基线的预测性能，事故识别精度从27.13%提升至88.03%。在高风险运动的零样本评估中，准确率从29.42%跃升至68.50%。

Conclusion: 方法不仅提升了自主驾驶场景的风险预测性能，也在真实世界高风险场景中展现了较强的泛化能力，潜在推动视觉语言模型在更复杂环境下的应用发展。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传染病大流行期间公共场所发热筛查中准确定位内眦区域的问题。

Method: 通过基于地标和眼轮廓边缘检测的粗精注册策略，利用多模态红外与可见光图像的注册方法实现内眦区域的准确定位。

Result: 注册精度达到2.7毫米以内，使内眦区域能够被精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于红外热成像的快速无创发热筛查提供了准确的区域定位技术，对传染病防控具有重要作用。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出CSAT模型，通过压缩感知方法降低Vision-Language Models (vLLMs)的注意力复杂度，同时保持语义的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vLLMs在处理视觉和文本输入时表现出色，但其标准注意力机制的二次复杂性导致高计算成本，尤其是在处理较长视频序列和复杂语言描述时。

Method: 引入了CSAT架构，利用随机测量矩阵将高维密钥和值表示投射到低维子空间，并采用稀疏恢复算法重建注意力输出，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验结果表明，CSAT在保持语义精度的同时，大幅提高了计算效率，并在标准基准测试中展示出卓越表现。

Conclusion: CSAT为下一代多模态Transformer提供了可扩展、高效且可解释的解决方案，尤其适用于具有高时序冗余的视频和稀疏跨模态关联的语言场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

*Hengyi Zhu,Linye Wei,He Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLOv8的增强型PCB缺陷检测算法VR-YOLO，通过多样化场景增强(DSE)和关键目标聚焦(KOF)方法显著提高了检测性能和视角鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有YOLO模型在PCB缺陷检测上对目标图像的角度、方向和清晰度有较高要求，难以适应实际应用场景的多样性。

Method: 通过提出多样化场景增强（DSE）扩展PCB缺陷数据集，并利用关键目标聚焦(KOF)方法结合角度损失和注意力机制提升小目标特征的学习能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，相较于YOLO模型，VR-YOLO在原始测试图上的均值平均精度(mAP)为98.9%，在视角偏移后的测试图上的mAP为94.7%，显著优于基线模型，且额外计算成本可忽略不计。

Conclusion: VR-YOLO算法有效强化了模型对视角偏移等复杂实际场景的适应能力，对工业级PCB缺陷检测意义重大。

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

### [14] [Concept-based Adversarial Attack: a Probabilistic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02965)
*Andi Zhang,Xuan Ding,Steven McDonagh,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过采用概率生成模型扩展至整个概念进行对抗样本生成，以实现更高效的攻击和多样化对抗样本的产生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法主要集中在单一图像的扰动上，难以生成多样化且具有统一语义的对抗样本，因此引入了基于概念的对抗攻击框架以解决这一问题。

Method: 通过建立一个概率生成模型或使用一组表示概念的图像，生成包含多样性（如姿态、视角、背景等）的对抗样本，同时确保这些样本能够保留原始概念的辨识特性。

Result: 该方法生成的对抗样本在多样性和概念保留方面表现更优，并在理论和实验上都体现了更高的攻击效率。

Conclusion: 基于概念的对抗攻击框架为传统对抗攻击提供了更全面的视角，能够生成更为多样化和高效的对抗样本，为相关领域研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Conclusion: AI技术，尤其是YOLOv11，是低能见度水下环境管道监测中的高效工具，对提升自动化故障诊断能力有重要意义。

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater
environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion,
and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail
to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection
in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline
structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a
comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating
target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种针对印度农作物的深度学习框架，实现国家尺度的农场级别作物类型识别，准确度超过75%-94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在地理可扩展性、作物类型覆盖范围、混合像素复杂性以及种植季节实时识别的挑战。

Method: 将Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星影像与全国农场边界数据相结合，通过深度学习框架进行12种主要作物的识别，集成自动季节检测算法和高效推理管道。

Result: 模型识别准确性在冬季达94%，在季风期达75%，并实现印度境内首个季中农场级别作物数据产品。

Conclusion: 该系统为印度农业监测和管理提供了可扩展性强、准确性高的解决方案，助力决策制定和政策优化。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

TL;DR: 本文研究利用MidJourney生成的图像，探讨人工智能在《圣经》叙事可视化中的作用，尤其是如何再现或重构神圣叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在揭示如何通过人工智能将《圣经》中叙述内容视觉化，并探讨其在文化、神学等方面的潜力和局限性。

Method: 通过比较AI生成图像、Google图像结果与经典绘画，分析其在风格、神学和文化维度上的表达。

Result: 研究表明，AI在生成美学丰富且富有想象力的图像上表现出色，但也反映了其训练数据的偏见与局限性。

Conclusion: AI可以作为解读《圣经》文本的创意伙伴，但其在宗教艺术中的角色复杂且存在争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种新的评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型（VLMs）在空间变形推理任务中的表现，发现现有模型在三维空间推理任务中表现较差，即使经过专门训练也难以提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有视觉语言模型是否具备空间推理能力，尤其是对空间对象的形成和操作能力的理解与应用。

Method: 提出一个新的评估框架，专为从2D到3D的空间变形推理设计基准测试，同时开发一套能够无限生成评估问题的引擎。设置阶梯式竞争机制，测试模型在前向推理（从操作到结果）和逆向推理（从结果到操作）中的表现。

Result: 基准测试结果显示，几乎所有模型在三维空间变形推理能力上表现不佳。针对性训练和主流推理增强方法的应用也未显著改善。

Conclusion: 当前的视觉语言模型尚未展现出足够的空间变形推理能力，这凸显了在这一领域中存在的重大挑战，为后续研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Iterative Misclassification Error Training (IMET)的新方法，用于优化医学影像分类的训练效率和模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集中存在噪声、错误标注和样本不足等问题，导致深度学习模型在医学影像诊断中容易过拟合或错误分类，这在医学领域可能产生严重风险。

Method: IMET结合了课程学习和核心集选择方法，通过识别分错的样本优化训练过程，并重点关注边缘案例和罕见结果，以提高模型的训练效率和准确性。

Result: 通过与当前最先进的ResNet模型在医学图像分类基准数据集上的对比，IMET表现出增强模型鲁棒性和准确性的潜力。

Conclusion: IMET方法有助于在医学影像分析中提高深度学习模型的表现，并降低过拟合和计算复杂度。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF)，一种新型架构，通过递归的多模态融合实现强大的跨模态注意力，且具备线性可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动多模态学习技术，通过解决深层融合与计算可扩展性之间的矛盾，为高模态环境提供有效解决方案。

Method: 提出了GRF架构，该方法利用Transformer解码器层进行对称跨模态注意力，并通过Gated Fusion Unit（GFU）加以动态调节，递归地处理各模态，线性扩展。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中，GRF性能优异，与复杂的基线方法相比仍具竞争力。同时，其生成的嵌入空间呈现良好的结构和类别分离性。

Conclusion: GRF为多模态表示学习提供了一种高效、可扩展而强大的新范式，特别适用于高模态的场景。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Motivation: 为了解决医疗AI系统在数据稀缺情况下的预训练需求，提出方法利用医学影像数据的多视图特性，避免对大型标注数据集的依赖。

Method: 利用胸部X光的正面和侧面影像对作为正样本对，通过从稀疏的图像块中重建每个视图并对齐其潜在嵌入的方式，进行自监督学习。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上表现出色，与基于监督目标或未利用数据结构的基线方法相比，性能更强。

Conclusion: 提出了一种轻便且可适用于不同模式的预训练框架，适合用于数据稀缺但具有一定结构的领域特定数据集。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than
existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image
datasets is developed.

TL;DR: 本研究提出FreqCross，一种融合多模态特征的新型网络，可以高效检测AI生成的图像，尤其是针对Stable Diffusion 3.5生成的高度真实的合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于现有检测方法难以应对日益真实的AI生成图像，尤其是新一代扩散模型（例如Stable Diffusion 3.5）生成的图像，该研究提出了更高效的检测方法以解决这一挑战。

Method: 设计了一种三分支架构：包括ResNet-18提取空间特征、轻量级CNN解析2D FFT频谱、以及多层感知机分析径向能量分布。通过简单特征拼接融合多模态线索，并引入一种新型的径向能量分布分析方法，用于捕捉扩散模型生成图像的特征性频率伪影。

Result: 在包含1万张真实（MS-COCO）与合成（Stable Diffusion 3.5）图像的实验中，FreqCross实现了97.8%的准确率，比最先进方法高5.2%。分析显示，合成图像在0.1-0.4归一化频率范围内具有明显的光谱特征。

Conclusion: FreqCross通过结合空间、频域和径向能量特征显著提高了AI图像检测能力，将为后续相关研究提供理论基础与技术支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic
images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised
frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and
pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脊柱侧弯检测方法存在辐射风险和诊断依赖性，且不适用于大规模筛查，亟需新的非侵入性检测方法。

Method: 利用步态视频，并结合动态时间规整（DTW）聚类、袋间时间注意（IBTA）机制，以及边界感知模型（BAM），同时引入文本指导以提升特征表示和可解释性。

Conclusion: TG-MILNet在非侵入性脊柱侧弯检测上效果显著，提升检测灵敏度和模型解释性，有望用作筛查工具。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Method: 提取HOG和TDA特征，分别训练七种经典机器学习模型，使用APTOS数据集进行二分类和五分类任务的实验比较。

Result: 在二分类任务中，HOG和TDA分别取得94.29%和94.18%的准确率，在多分类任务中分别为74.41%和74.69%。

Conclusion: 两种特征提取方法性能竞争性强，但代表图像不同的结构特性；方法具有可解释性，适用于其他医学影像，并可结合深度学习。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在推理后期常过度依赖文本信息，忽略了视觉信息的整合。

Method: 通过对模型注意力模式的分析，发现MLLMs在适当引导下，可以自主将注意力重新集中于视觉输入。提出Look-Back方法，引导模型在推理中自主决定何时、何处以及如何关注视觉信息，而无需显式注入视觉信息或额外的结构约束。

Result: 通过实证评估表明，Look-Back方法显著提升了模型在多个多模态基准上的推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: Look-Back证明了MLLMs在适当引导下具备内生的视觉融合推理论证能力，无需额外干预即可增强性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue
in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our
standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy

digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative
method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology,
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology
(SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time
microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images
of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic
analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review
the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific
and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of
intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including
neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and
periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI
foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for rail line detection and the
identification of human beings in proximity to the track, utilizing the YOLOv5
deep learning model to mitigate potential accidents. The technique incorporates
real-time video data to identify railway tracks with impressive accuracy and
recognizes nearby moving objects within a one-meter range, specifically
targeting the identification of humans. This system aims to enhance safety
measures in railway environments by providing real-time alerts for any detected
human presence close to the track. The integration of a functionality to
identify objects at a longer distance further fortifies the preventative
capabilities of the system. With a precise focus on real-time object detection,
this method is poised to deliver significant contributions to the existing
technologies in railway safety. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation, yielding a remarkable
improvement in accuracy over existing methods. These results underscore the
potential of this approach to revolutionize safety measures in railway
environments, providing a substantial contribution to accident prevention
strategies.

### [30] [LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054)
*Ana Vasilcoiu,Ivona Najdenkoska,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的方法LATTE，通过建模潜在嵌入的轨迹以区分真实图像与生成图像，在多种数据集和跨生成器测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于扩散生成的图像生成器迅速发展，区分真实图像与生成图像变得越来越困难，这威胁到数字媒体的可信度，因此需要开发能够泛化到不同生成器的图像检测方法。

Method: 提出LATTE方法，通过模型潜在嵌入在多个去噪步骤中的轨迹，而非单步重建误差，从而识别生成图像；引入潜在-视觉特征精炼模块，融合潜在轨迹特征和视觉特征，再通过轻量级分类器进行检测。

Result: 在GenImage和DiffusionFake等基准数据集上，LATTE方法优于现有基线，并在跨生成器和跨数据集环境下表现强劲。

Conclusion: LATTE展示了潜在嵌入轨迹在生成图像检测中的潜力，提供了一种有效的泛化检测解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种心理学分类法讨论视觉语言模型（VLMs）的幻觉行为，并开发AIpsych基准对模型行为进行系统分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs的幻觉行为是否可能反映人类心理学中的认知偏见。

Method: 分类和分析视觉语言模型的幻觉行为（包括奉承倾向、逻辑不一致和权威偏见），并设计AIpsych基准测试解析模型在面对策略性问题时的行为模式。

Result: 实验揭示随着模型规模增长，奉承倾向增强但权威偏见减少；人类实验验证了研究假设并强调了模型与人类行为的差异。

Conclusion: 工作为理解VLMs幻觉提供新视角，并表明在模型评估中融入心理学原理的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升在高风险应用中使用具有可解释性和物理意义的机器学习算法，并推动其在气象科学中的应用。

Method: 使用数学方法提取特征（例如通过灰度共生矩阵提取云纹理），结合使用EBM对流旗标数据训练模型，并优化以更符合领域科学家的思路。

Result: 尽管最终模型的准确性不及更复杂的算法，但其在解释性和实际性能上表现良好，标志着物理学基础ML算法开发的重要一步。

Conclusion: 通过人机协作开发的EBM方法为气象学中的类似应用引入了一种可解释性强的替代选择，并展示其在科学问题中的潜力。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Conclusion: 该系统能有效提升病害识别精度，帮助农民早期防治病害，从而增加产量，促进农业发展和粮食安全。

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Motivation: 研究如何通过简单方法实时解析刚体的旋转问题，从而对场景中的刚体进行分割。

Method: 在正交投影和固定相机条件下，追踪图像中一个特征点的位置变化即可得到刚体的瞬时旋转率，无需场景的先验知识。

Result: 提出的方法能够通过仿真和实际视频数据验证，可实现刚体间的分割。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于刚体形状，适合并行处理，为场景解析提供了新途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种改进人类活动识别泛化能力的简单而高效的对比学习损失函数——SICL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别的传感器信号因主体的差异性而产生显著域偏移，致使对比学习模型难以泛化。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了关注活动特征而非主体特征的SICL方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，通过重新权衡同一主体的负样本对，以抑制主体特定特征，突出活动特定信息。

Result: SICL在三个公开基准上（UTD-MHAD、MMAct和DARai）的性能提升高达11%，显示出其在多种设置下的良好适应性。

Conclusion: SICL方法能够高效提升人类活动识别的跨主体泛化能力，兼容多个任务场景，具有良好的实际应用前景。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Result: 研究发现，不同视觉编码器的贡献存在明显冗余，某些编码器甚至对模型性能有负面影响。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR通过改进双频协同分类流程和数据利用方式，提高了分类性能，展示了其在双频PolSAR领域的潜力。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像（T2I）基准测试由于使用固定提示词可能对模型能力产生偏差，无法真实反映模型性能。

Method: 提出ConceptMix++，该方法通过多模态优化管道结合视觉语言模型反馈来迭代优化提示词，从而提高生成质量和对模型能力的公平比较。

Result: 优化后的提示词显著提升了生成模型在组合能力上的表现，同时发现了模型在空间关系和形状等概念上的额外潜能，以及优化提示词在跨模型上的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Rigid基准测试低估了模型能力，而ConceptMix++提供了一种更准确的评估框架，有助于更公正地推动未来的模型开发。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

Result: 在多种数据集、架构和分辨率上，所提方法在无需微调及基于微调的遗忘方法上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法能在不微调的情况下实现高效的机器遗忘，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Conclusion: 该方法具备无需位置注释的弱监督能力，同时在新类别上表现良好，具备通用性并超越了部分监督模型表现。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型半监督语义分割框架SemiOVS，用于有效利用大量的OOD未标注图像，并在Pascal VOC和Context数据集上展示了在92标签设置下显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在半监督语义分割中虽然在控制数据集分割的学术场景中取得了良好效果，但未探索大量未标注图像的潜在好处，而现实世界的数据分布往往与目标数据不同。

Method: 提出SemiOVS框架，结合开放词汇分割模型对OOD图像生成伪标签，从而提升半监督语义分割性能。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和Context数据集的实验表明，使用大量额外未标注图像在标签稀少场景下提升了性能，OVS模型标注的OOD图像使性能显著提高。

Conclusion: SemiOVS框架能够有效利用丰富的OOD未标注图像进行语义分割任务，性能优于现有方法，并为未来研究及实际应用提供了参考。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态任务需求增加，但单模态领域泛化的方法直接应用于多模态领域往往效果不佳，尤其在跨模态一致性和泛化随机性上存在明显问题。

Method: 方法通过引入统一表示，将不同模态的数据映射到共同空间中，并辅以监督的解耦框架分离模态通用和模态特定的信息，从而实现对多模态间一致性的改进。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（EPIC-Kitchens 和 Human-Animal-Cartoon）上的实验表明，所提方法显著提升了多模态领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效改善多模态数据在未知分布下的泛化性能，并优于现有方法。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前如何将复杂的文本风格转化为逼真的视觉表现是生成式AI的一大挑战。

Method: 设计了一条从AWS到LLM再到扩散模型的生成管道，先由Claude 3.7 Sonnet生成描述性文本，再用Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium生成图像。

Result: 在人类评价中，生成的图像与作者风格匹配度平均4.08/5，但在表现抽象叙事元素上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种创新的端到端方法，用于视觉化作者风格的个性化表达，为跨模态创意应用开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Motivation: 应对标注数据成本高及隐私限制问题，同时解决现有SFUDA方法中的原型质量差和伪标签错误问题。

Method: 包含三个阶段：1.引入可靠样本记忆（RSM）模块以提升原型质量；2.多视图对比学习（MVCL）提升伪标签质量；3.噪声标签过滤进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home及Office-31数据集上实验，分类准确率分别较次优方法提升约2%，较13种先进方法平均提升约6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法提升了SFUDA的有效性，表明改进原型质量与伪标签可信度对领域适配的关键作用。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in
producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial
design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的框架DESign，通过动态上下文感知卷积（DCAC）和子网正则化时间序列分类（SR-CTC）显著提升了连续手语识别的表现，且在主流数据集上达到了最新的技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续手语识别方法在处理多样化样本时表现不足，动态卷积虽然适合此任务但忽略了时间依赖与上下文动态的捕捉。本文意在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出动态上下文感知卷积（DCAC）和子网正则化时间序列分类（SR-CTC）。其中，DCAC根据上下文动态调整卷积权重以更好地捕捉帧间运动线索，而SR-CTC通过对子网络的监督正则训练，避免模型过拟合主路径并加强多尺度一致性。

Result: 在PHOENIX14、PHOENIX14-T及CSL-Daily主流连续手语识别数据集上，DESign框架表现优异，取得了最新的技术性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合动态上下文感知卷积和子网正则化时间序列分类，DESign有效提高了识别精度并解决模型泛化及过拟合问题，对连续手语识别具有重要意义。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

TL;DR: 该论文通过Pose-Star框架改善了现有时尚图像编辑中遮罩生成的灵活性和对姿态的鲁棒性，提出了一种解剖结构感知的编辑方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的双阶段管线过于关注生成器优化，而忽视了遮罩的可控性，导致用户定义灵活性差和姿态鲁棒性弱的问题。

Method: 提出Pose-Star框架，通过动态重组身体结构生成解剖结构感知的遮罩，利用骨架关键点校准扩散注意力，结合相位分析改进遮罩生成并通过边缘对齐和交叉自注意力融合提升精度。

Result: 实现了更灵活的用户定义编辑，同时在复杂姿态中表现出更强的鲁棒性，并提高了解剖结构的局部化能力。

Conclusion: Pose-Star框架为工业化时尚图像编辑铺平了道路，通过将用户可控性与姿态鲁棒性相结合，填补了当前管线的不足。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法未能应对未知攻击，面临对抗鲁棒性普适性的问题，因此该研究试图发现各类攻击间的潜在共同特性。

Method: 提出了一种基于对抗样本低熵特性的两阶段REAL方法，通过最大化和最小化预测熵的优化方案，进行对抗样本的测试时修正，并引入攻击感知加权机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，REAL方法显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过揭示低熵特性的普适性，REAL方法对未知攻击表现出更强的泛化能力并提升防御性能。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NCU的模型微调框架，用于提升预训练视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，通过去除噪声对应的学习内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型需要大规模数据训练，但数据质量参差不齐，容易引入语义不相关的信息，对模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 提出了NCU框架，通过学习最难的负样本，在一个统一的最优传输目标下实现快速微调，从而消除噪声样本的负面影响。

Result: 在主流的CLIP模型和多个下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，表现优于现有的鲁棒训练方法，并且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU提升了视觉语言模型对噪声数据的鲁棒性，并展现了在零样本任务中的优越性。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their
surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for
reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

TL;DR: 本论文发现CLIP模型在处理细粒度语义时存在局限性，并提出一种使用随机多裁剪增强的解决方法来提升CLIP的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理细粒度局部语义时表现有限，需提高其对局部特征的分析能力以改进分类性能。

Method: 通过随机多裁剪增强激活CLIP的局部特征分析能力，裁剪部分区域以限制模型的感受野并重新校准注意力机制。

Conclusion: 本文方法简单有效，可作为插件化解决方案，缓解CLIP对图像整体模式的偏好，同时提升其对细粒度语义的理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自驾车需要精确感知周围环境中的移动物体，以保障安全导航。现有方法依赖时间序列，耗时且数据处理复杂，而雷达传感器能直接获取目标的速度信息，有潜力实现更高效的运动分割任务。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计了Radar Velocity Transformer，通过在网络中融入速度信息，实现单帧雷达点云中的运动物体分割。还提出了基于Transformer的上采样方法，改善稀疏点云插值的限制。

Conclusion: 所提方法无需时间序列数据即可高效、精准地完成移动物体分割任务，为自驾技术提供了一种快速可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种专为变化检测设计的二值神经网络（BiCD），并在街景和遥感数据上表现出卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网络二值化方法在变化检测中的表现较差，限制了网络的表示能力和特征分离能力。

Method: 通过信息瓶颈原理，引入辅助目标优化编码器以保留输入信息并提升特征分辨能力，同时设计紧凑的辅助模块以优化重构损失和变化检测损失。

Result: 在街景和遥感数据上进行了广泛实验，BiCD刷新了二值神经网络变化检测的性能基准。

Conclusion: BiCD提升了二值神经网络在变化检测中的性能，为该领域设立了新标杆。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视频分类需要多模态融合来捕获复杂的时空和语义特征，单一模态限制了模型表现，因此需要新框架解决此问题。

Method: 使用基于GRU的序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制，将视频、图像和文本特征进行融合。训练采用分类或回归损失，并通过特征级增强和自编码技术进行正则化。

Result: 框架在DVD数据集和Aff-Wild2数据集上的实验中表现优异，明显优于单模态方法；跨模态注意力机制和特征增强对性能提升贡献突出。

Conclusion: 所提的多模态融合方法在细粒度视频分类和情感预测任务中展示了其强大的鲁棒性和优越性能，具有很好的推广性。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Motivation: 目前病理学领域尽管已有大量的基础模型（FM），但针对细胞表型分析的模型性能尚未在统一框架内进行基准测试，因此需要一个新的工具来评估这些模型的效果。

Method: 提出PhenoBench，它包括一个名为PhenoCell的新数据集，该数据集使用多重成像方法标注了14种细粒度细胞类型，并提供了代码支持，以便系统性评估多种常见病理FM模型的表现。

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models
(FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been
benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A
comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，CLOT的循环学习机制显著提升了无监督动作分割的效果。

Conclusion: 引入闭环特性和多层次循环学习机制的CLOT增强了无监督动作分割的性能并验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Method: 通过多次实验，评估不同模型在人脸识别基准数据集上的表现，包括直接比较和结合得分级别的融合方法，以及对其解释性进行分析。

Result: (a) 领域特定模型在性能上优于通用模型；(b) 通用模型在包含更多上下文信息的过度裁剪人脸图像上表现更好；(c) 将基础模型与特定领域模型结合可提高准确率；(d) 基础模型可增强FR管道的解释力，部分情况下可纠正领域模型的低置信决策。

Conclusion: 将领域特定模型与通用基础模型相结合能更好地提升人脸识别任务的性能与解释力，因此在实际应用中需平衡两者的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are

*Bingjie Lu,Zhengyang Lu,Yijiashun Qi,Hanzhe Guo,Tianyao Sun,Zunduo Zhao*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供一种便捷且经济的方法来测量路面摩擦力，并应用于道路混合设计中。

Method: 提出了集料突出面积作为指标，通过实验室数据（包括拍摄图像和动态摩擦测试设备测得的摩擦力值）建立统计模型验证其有效性。

Result: 提出的指标与摩擦系数的相关性调整R平方值均超过0.90。该指标比文献中的其他基于图像的指标更准确地反映了摩擦变化。

Conclusion: 该指标是一种高效、经济的工具，可用于混合设计阶段考虑路面摩擦问题。

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种2.5D物体检测框架，用于基础设施安装的路边摄像头以弥补自动驾驶汽车传感器的不足，在跨视角和恶劣天气条件下展示出高度准确性与通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶传感器被遮挡或视角限制问题，通过路边摄像头提供补充信息支持，同时适应高角度、俯视视角下的域偏移问题。

Method: 提出了一种2.5D物体检测方法，通过预测车辆地面平面作为图像框中的平行四边形表示位置、大小和方向，结合真实世界与合成场景数据进行训练，以提高通用性。在恶劣天气和新的视角测试集下评估表现。

Result: 实验表明，模型在检测准确性、跨视角通用性和抵御不同光条件与天气影响方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法特定于路边安装摄像头，能有效解决自动驾驶场景下视角和气象变化带来的挑战，提升检测结果的泛化性和鲁棒性，提供模型权重与代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Motivation: 现有的时空基础模型多为领域特定，但任务的通用建模潜力尚未明确，特别是视频基础模型在多个科学领域的适应能力。

Method: 开发了SciVid基准，涵盖医学视觉、动物行为和天气预报等五个科学视频任务，使用简单的可训练模块调整现有六种主流ViFMs，并与领域基线进行对比。

Result: 通过迁移学习，ViFMs在多个应用中取得了先进的结果，但也暴露了其在科学领域的局限性。

Conclusion: ViFMs在一定程度上具备科学领域通用性，但仍需改进以拓展其在高影响力科学应用中的适应性。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Causal-SAM-LLM框架，旨在解决深度学习在医学图像分割中的泛化问题，显著提高了跨域稳健性和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在医学图像分割中的泛化能力有限，主要原因是对拍摄样式和解剖特征的非因果关联学习。

Method: 利用静态SAM编码器基础，提出两项创新：(1) 语言对抗解耦(LAD)，通过视觉语言模型生成图像样式的文本描述，并训练特征避开这些描述；(2) 测试时因果干预(TCI)，通过LLM解析医生的自然语言指令，实时调整分割解码器特征。

Result: 通过四个公开数据集的综合基准测试，模型实现OOD鲁棒性的新技术领先水平，Dice分数提升6.2点，Hausdorff距离减少15.8mm，同时模型可训练参数低于9%。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建高鲁棒性、高效率和可交互控制的医学人工智能系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EEG-VJEPA，一种将脑电图（EEG）信号视为视频序列以实现新颖分类的方法，其在TUH数据集上优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑电图分析面对标注数据有限、高维度及缺乏空间和时间依赖性的可扩展模型问题。

Method: 提出一种基于V-JEPA的自监督学习模型EEG-VJEPA，通过联合嵌入和自适应掩码来学习脑电图的时空关联表示，将其视作类似视频序列。

Result: EEG-VJEPA在TUH异常EEG数据集上的分类准确率优于现有模型，并能捕获生理相关的信号模式，提供可解释的嵌入表示。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA框架为脑电图的可扩展性和可信度分析在临床环境中的应用提供了新方向，并可能支持人机协作的诊断工作流。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时适应过程中仅利用文本模态的原型，忽略了类名中的歧义性语义，难以准确捕捉视觉概念，性能受限。

Method: 提出一种名为ProtoMM的无训练框架，以多模态原型适配VLMs，结合文本描述和视觉数据动态更新视觉粒子，且利用语义距离优化原型及测试图像的重要性。

Result: 在ImageNet及其变种数据集上，与当前最优方法相比，平均准确率提高1.03%。

Conclusion: ProtoMM改进了多模态特征对VLM的适配能力，显著提升零样本学习任务的性能，展现了在未见场景中的强泛化能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉嵌入模型的排序能力，以及是否可以通过简单方法捕捉连续、有序属性的结构。

Method: 通过分析7种流行编码器和9个具有不同属性的数据集，研究将嵌入投影到排序轴上的效果。

Result: 发现许多嵌入本身具有排序特性，少量样本甚至极端样本即可恢复具有意义的排序轴。

Conclusion: 视觉嵌入模型的排序能力为图像排序带来了新应用，同时启发了对嵌入结构和学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Motivation: 目前的“分割任何物体” (segment anything) 研究在大规模数据上显示出潜力，但直接将这些模型适配到复杂的医学图像数据上仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 引入了时序适配器以捕获图像相关性，使用基于信心的记忆机制储存高置信特征以供稍后检索，并建立了跨模态的MedBank-100k数据集。

Conclusion: SAMed-2在解决医学图像噪声、跨模态适配和持续学习问题上具有领先性能，展现了医学图像分割领域良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 此方法展示了LLM在提升手语识别任务中的潜力，且无需模型再训练即可实现灵活的词汇匹配与消歧。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Result: 系统计算需求比现有模块低18倍，且准确度达到88%。

Conclusion: 该系统具备低计算需求和高精度，适用于工业和住宅安全领域的系统普及应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Motivation: 当前3DGS SLAM方法在室外场景下存在几何先验不足或尺度漂移问题，引发追踪准确性和建图质量的减弱，亟需改进。

Method: 提出一种自一致的追踪模块，基于3DGS点云图避免累计误差，并设计局部基于分区的动态映射模块，以引入几何先验避免尺度模糊。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上展现了新的视角合成的先进性能，并在追踪准确性上优于其他3DGS SLAM方法。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS为室外环境提供了一种高精度、鲁棒的纯RGB SLAM解决方案，对于复杂室外场景尤为适用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

Result: 基于LightningDiT模型，通过两步生成（NFE=2）在ImageNet 256x256数据集上实现了1.32的最新FID指标，单步生成（NFE=1）达到1.76，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACM为构建高性能且高效的少步生成模型提供了通用的新方法，其简单有效并且具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种用于事件驱动和帧图像结合的高效混合框架，用于图像语义分割，在多个数据集上取得了最先进的表现并降低了能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前事件相机的语义分割方法未能充分利用帧和事件信息的互补性，面临复杂的训练策略和高计算成本等问题。

Method: 采用了一个由脉冲神经网络 (SNN) 和人工神经网络 (ANN) 两个分支组成的混合框架，并引入了三个模块（ATW Injector、EDS Injector 和 CSF 模块）以加强两个分支间的信息交互。

Result: 该框架在多个数据集（DDD17-Seg、DSEC-Semantic、M3ED-Semantic）上达到了最先进的分割准确性，并在DSEC-Semantic数据集上实现了65%的能耗减少。

Conclusion: 新框架不仅在准确性和能耗上具有优势，还展示了事件和帧信息有效集成的潜力，解决了现有方法的主要限制。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练策略，使得DINOv2模型在计算效率和鲁棒性上取得了显著改善，同时减少了所需的预训练时间和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉基础模型依赖超大型架构和海量数据，对一些特定需求难以适用，因此需要发展计算资源需求更低的预训练解决方案。

Method: 引入频率过滤课程（从低到高频逐步训练）和高斯噪声补丁增强策略，以实现更高效的预训练过程。

Result: 方法在ViT-B/16框架上，预训练时间和算力分别减少约1.6倍和2.25倍，且在ImageNet-C腐蚀基准测试中保持了鲁棒性，线性探测性能亦具竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过这一方法，大规模自监督基础建模变得更加可及，同时展示了数据课程和增强的潜力，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种零内存开销的容错技术，以保护视觉Transformer（ViT）参数免受存储中比特翻转故障的影响，提高其在关键应用中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉Transformer（ViT）在分类、目标检测和分割等视觉任务中展现出优越性能，其在自动驾驶等安全关键领域的应用需求日益增加。但ViT模型的参数在存储中易受到比特翻转故障的影响，因此需要提高其容错性能。

Method: 通过将参数的最低有效位替换为奇偶校验位，在不增加模型内存开销的情况下提供错误检测机制；当检测到故障时，将受影响的参数置零（masking），利用ViT模型参数大多接近零的特点减轻精度下降。

Result: 该方法有效提升了ViT模型参数对比特翻转故障的鲁棒性，可靠性提高了多达三个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是一种适用于关键应用的零开销容错解决方案，显著增强了视觉Transformer模型的可靠性和稳健性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR模型多依赖单一数据集训练，存在泛化性问题，多数据集联合训练则面临特征聚合瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA)，通过参考码本和查询特征的交叉相似性提升特征描述能力，且计算复杂度低。

Result: QAA模型的性能优于现有方法，在不同数据集上实现了平衡的泛化和高效表现。

Conclusion: QAA方法提高了VPR模型的泛化能力和特征聚合效果，是解决多数据集训练关键问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 目前的文本到图像扩散模型虽能生成高质量图像，但常无法准确反映文本提示中的所有语义信息，且难以自动检测。

Method: 提出使用B-cos模块的扩散模型架构，通过解释生成图像中每个提示词影响的像素区域，实现可解释性。

Result: B-cos扩散模型可生成高质量图像，同时提供提示词和图像对齐的有意义解释。

Conclusion: B-cos扩散模型不仅能保持生成质量，还能增强提示词与图像的语义对齐解释性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Motivation: 当前基于神经辐射场的数据驱动方法尽管能够实现高保真的场景建模，但渲染效率较低，现有基于3D高斯点的动态场景建模方法忽略了细粒度的帧与视点间变化。

Method: 提出ArmGS方法，利用复合高斯点技术，通过多粒度外观优化（从局部到全局及动态物体层级），对高斯进行细化建模。

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于层次语义-视觉融合(HSVF)框架，以应对远距离图像去雾问题，通过语义流重建无雾场景并通过视觉流恢复详细结构信息，综合实验表明优于当前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在远距离场景去雾研究领域的探索不足，而单靠可见光无法恢复远距离细节，因此需要结合近红外与可见光的互补信息进行多模态融合。

Method: 提出了层次语义-视觉融合(HSVF)框架，包括语义流和视觉流。语义流通过对齐模态无关的本质表示获得抗雾语义预测，并以此作为先验恢复清晰场景；视觉流通过融合近红外与可见光信息恢复丢失的结构细节。

Result: 通过双流合作，HSVF生成兼具高对比度场景和丰富纹理细节的去雾图像，并提出了新的可见-红外像素对齐雾霾数据集，用于评估与对比实验。

Conclusion: 实验证明HSVF框架在实际远距离去雾中的效果显著优于当前最先进方法。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Conclusion: 因果启发的表示学习算法能有效解决跨域活动识别中的分布移位问题，展现了良好的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在放射学报告生成中注重语言流畅性，而忽视临床有效性，且难以关联X光图像与文本。

Method: 利用最优传输对齐图像特征与报告中提取的疾病标签；在图像和文本特征整合后进行大型语言模型微调，并设计新型疾病预测模块。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上取得自然语言生成与临床效能指标的最佳性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG框架能生成语言连贯且临床准确的放射学报告，显著提升应用效果。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and

Result: 实验表明该方法在合成和真实数据集上都明显优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic方法有效解决了现有方法的限制，能够稳健地生成高质量的逆渲染结果。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ASEA通过动态捕捉个体间的交互关系，提升了交互建模的准确性和灵活性，为相关领域提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视觉惯性(VI)数据对毫米波雷达场景流进行监督估计的新框架，可替代昂贵的3D LiDAR设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毫米波雷达场景流方法依赖于昂贵且不普及的3D LiDAR点云数据，而VI数据更易获得，但视觉图像无法捕捉3D运动，且VI刚性变换存在时间漂移问题，影响估计准确性。

Method: 提出了一个融合运动学模型和神经网络学习的无漂移刚性变换估计模块，用于静态点场景流推断；还开发了一个光学与毫米波联合监督提取模块，通过光学和毫米波约束对动态点场景流进行学习。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化对静态和动态点的监督提高了毫米波雷达场景流估计的性能，是低成本环境下的一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法在处理低光多视图图像时存在低效性，尤其是难以有效降噪并保持颜色和多视图的一致性。

Method: 提出了RoSe框架，利用三维空间中的光亮过渡估计，将低光图像到正常光图像任务建模为一种特定的渲染问题，并通过低秩特性约束过渡表示来提升降噪质量。

Result: 实验证明RoSe在渲染质量和多视图一致性方面均大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoSe框架在提升低光多视图图像的重建和渲染质量方面具有显著效果，提供了有效的理论方法与实际参考。

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在复杂道路环境中实现准确且可靠的OOD检测，解决现有方法在处理特定场景（如密集叠加物体、远距离小物体、大型前景物体）时的性能瓶颈。

Method: 设计了一种基于CoT的框架，利用大模型（如GPT-4）的知识与推理能力，通过改进的图像理解和基于提示的推理，针对性解决OOD检测中的困难场景问题。

Conclusion: 所提方法为复杂驾驶场景中的OOD检测提供了一种鲁棒且可解释的解决方案，具有显著的实践意义。

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

remains hidden for blind evaluation. We also propose Rate-Distortion Alignment
Error (RDAE), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies how well VQA models
preserve bitrate-quality ordering, directly supporting codec parameter tuning.
Testing IQA/VQA methods reveals that popular VQA metrics exhibit high RDAE and
lower correlations, underscoring the dataset challenges and utility. The open

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NRSeg的抗噪学习框架，用于BEV语义分割，实现了在无监督和半监督任务中显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BEV语义分割在无监督和半监督学习中表现欠佳，主要原因是标注数据的同质分布问题。本文研究使用驾驶世界模型生成的合成数据以提升数据多样性，并希望通过新的方法克服合成数据生成噪声问题。

Method: NRSeg框架引入了三个关键模块：1) 透视几何一致性度量（PGCM），用于衡量生成数据的模型指导能力；2) 双分布并行预测（BiDPP），通过多项分布和Dirichlet分布的并行预测提高模型的鲁棒性；3) 分层的局部语义排除（HLSE），解决BEV语义分割任务中的非互斥性问题。

Result: NRSeg框架在无监督和半监督BEV语义分割任务中表现突出，分别提高了mIoU 13.8%和11.4%。

Conclusion: NRSeg通过创新性设计显著提升了BEV语义分割任务的性能，为在真实世界中应用此类系统提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于领域泛化人脸防伪的新框架，联合对齐模型的权重和偏置，提高在目标领域的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前领域泛化人脸防伪中，决策边界的偏置对齐问题被忽视，导致在目标领域分类门限不一致且性能下降。

Method: 方法包括特征正交分解（FOD）和组内缩放风险最小化（GS-RM），通过正交分解明确特征空间中的领域不变和领域特定子空间，同时利用组内缩放平衡多个领域的误差。

Result: 提出的方法在基准数据集上取得了最新的性能，提升了准确率、减少了偏置不对齐，并增强了目标领域的泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中有效地对齐领域不变和特定特征，提出的框架解决了偏置无法对齐的问题，并提供了新的评价指标来量化对齐效果。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

Conclusion: 研究整合先进AI技术与生态学知识，提出了一种可扩展、成本低的地面栖息地监测框架，为全国范围内的生物多样性保护和土地利用决策提供支持。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉变换器(ViTs)在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题严重，尤其是其全局表示学习依赖于多层感知机 (MLPs) 时。

Method: 通过用拥有局部可塑性和样本选择性更新参数特点的KAN替代ViTs中的MLPs，用样条激活函数减少损失先前知识的风险。

Result: 实验结果表明，与传统MLP-ViTs相比，KAN-ViTs在知识保留和任务适应方面的表现显著提高。

Conclusion: 通过将KAN集成到ViTs中，该研究为动态环境中的持续学习算法带来了更鲁棒和更具适应性的模型解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Conclusion: PresentAgent展示了可控多模态代理在将静态文本材料转变为动态的、易访问的演示格式中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and
exploration for embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了DIVER框架，通过将强化学习与基于扩散的生成方法相结合，用于端到端自动驾驶，以改善轨迹的多样性与可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前端到端自动驾驶方法常依赖单一专家演示的模仿学习，容易导致保守性与行为同质化，限制了在复杂现实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种名为DIVER的框架，结合强化学习与基于扩散的生成技术。通过在地图元素和周围环境的基础上生成多个参考轨迹，并应用奖励约束的强化学习指导扩散过程，保证轨迹的安全性和多样性。此外，还设计了新的多样性测度指标。

Result: 通过在NAVSIM、Bench2Drive和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，DIVER显著提升了轨迹多样性，有效解决了模仿学习中的模式坍塌问题。

Conclusion: DIVER框架能生成多样化且可行的驾驶轨迹，增强了端到端自动驾驶的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Motivation: 当前解决OCD任务的方法主要挖掘标注数据中的可迁移知识，但面对有限标注数据或类别时知识不足，限制了模型对未知类别数据的识别能力。

Method: 提出了一个名为DiffGRE的扩散框架，包括三阶段：1）通过跨图像插值在扩散潜在空间中生成新的样本，2）以多样性为导向优化生成的样本，并排除与已知类别相似的样本，3）利用生成数据的半监督编码为模型注入额外的类别知识。

Conclusion: DiffGRE框架通过生成、优化和编码策略，增强了OCD任务中对有限标注和未知类别的适应能力，为精细分类问题提供了一种新的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法未能很好区分短期和长期预测，且连续预测中缺乏充足的先验信息利用。

Method: 提出了一个名为Temporal Continual Learning (TCL)的多阶段训练框架，并引入Prior Compensation Factor (PCF)用于补偿丢失的先验信息，同时通过理论推导设计了更合理的优化目标。

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上的实验显示出所提出框架的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能与不同HMP模型整合，并适用于多种数据集和应用，显著提升了人体运动预测的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Conclusion: DOCTOR模型证明了同步多模态学习和领域不变特征提取方法在短视频虚假信息检测领域广泛适用，其提出的创新模块能够显著改善领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at
https://github.com/ghh1125/DOCTOR.

Motivation: 动作预测受限于不同动作转换速度及相似动作特征之间的影响，导致不合理且不一致的预测结果。

Result: 在四个动作预测数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法持续超过现有最优方法的表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效改进了动作转换平滑性及特征学习能力，为随机人类动作预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at
https://hyqlat.github.io/STABACB.github.io/.

Motivation: 随着全景跨视角地理定位技术趋近于性能瓶颈，实际应用中更常见的是具有未知相机参数的窄视场图像，因此迫切需要研究更符合实际问题的解决方案。

Conclusion: 优化的检索和重新排序策略能显著提升跨视角地理定位的实用性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多目标跟踪任务面临动态变化环境、模型学习与对象分类等多重挑战，因此需要高效解法改善跟踪性能。

Method: 利用高斯过程作为运动模型与非齐次泊松过程作为观测模型，通过粒子滤波与参数学习实现目标跟踪与分类扩展。

Result: 提出的GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion算法在性能评估与基准测试中优于现有算法，显著减少跟踪中断。

Conclusion: 本文方法能有效改善动态场景下跟踪目标的连续性与分类性能，尤其适合复杂和动态环境中的应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Motivation: 现有轻量化视觉Transformer在图像超分辨率任务中受限于窗口自注意力模型的感受野大小和计算复杂度之间的平衡。

Method: 提出了一种级联提示块（CPB），由全局锚点提示层（GAPL）和两个局部提示层（LPL）组成，通过全局与局部信息的结合，扩大感受野并保持较低计算成本。

Conclusion: PromptSR展示了通过结合全局先验和局部细节以提升图像超分辨率任务性能的潜力，并具有显著的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/wenyang001/PromptSR.

MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively
fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths
of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal
representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to

through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在数据成本和图像生成的精细控制上存在局限性，尤其是对复杂语境的处理不足。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM 在提升文本到图像生成的控制性和语义一致性方面取得了显著进展，为图像生成领域带来了重要突破。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations
confirm the perceptual superiority of our generated images. LVLM-Composer
represents a significant step towards truly controllable and compositionally
accurate open-ended text-to-image generation.

*Fengrui Tian,Tianjiao Ding,Jinqi Luo,Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DynamicVoyager方法，通过将动态场景生成视为动态内容的场景扩展任务，实现了从单视角生成一致的、不受限制的动态场景视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的动态场景通常依赖于多视图训练，且生成区域受限于训练相机的视角变化范围，无法满足扩展性需求。为解决此问题，提出了一种新方法。

Method: 提出DynamicVoyager，将单视图视频生成动态点云，结合光线上下文在新视角渲染视频并进行场景扩展和点云更新，以实现一致的3D动态场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，新方法生成的场景在相机平移过程中保持了动态一致性，且可通过场景提示控制生成内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager突破了单视角生成动态场景的局限，提供了可靠的生成一致3D动态场景的方法，并具有应用于虚拟现实等领域的潜力。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合空域变增益和分区合并的传感器设计，提升了摄像头的噪声性能及动态范围。


<details>

Motivation: 随着像素尺寸的小型化，图像传感器的动态范围及噪声性能受到限制，本文旨在改进这些性能。

Method: 提出空间变增益策略以根据场景亮度调整增益，并推导最优分区合并尺寸，平衡分辨率和噪声。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种场景，如高动态范围成像和镜头失真校正，展示出对成像质量提升的潜力。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速旁路机制(QBM)和修正反演过程(RRP)，在加速图像去噪生成任务的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成任务上表现出色，但其在图像修复任务中的去噪过程耗时过长。

Method: 提出QBM，通过中间近似值跳过初期去噪步骤，并结合RRP优化噪声匹配以平衡随机性和一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CelebA-HQ的超分辨率、去模糊和压缩感知等任务上有效加速了去噪过程，同时保留了性能。

Conclusion: 新方法在加速和维持原始性能之间实现了平衡，为图像修复任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Conclusion: 通过该方法能实现更高质量的肖像风格迁移，并提高了多领域的泛化能力。相关代码和预训练模型已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Motivation: 实验鼠在生物医学研究中的重要性使得精确的3D表面运动重建具有挑战性，传统方法受限于稀疏关键点跟踪且缺乏结构化3D数据集。

Method: 1. 构建了第一个高保真稠密视角的合成实验鼠数据集；2. 使用基于transformer的前馈架构和triplane表示进行单张图像的高质量3D表面生成；3. 引入基于地理线的连续对应嵌入作为语义先验。

Result: 实验表明MoReMouse在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: MoReMouse通过创新性数据集、架构设计和语义嵌入技术，实现了实验鼠高质量3D重建，为相关领域研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出GSTDS算法，通过谱分析选择网络训练数据子集，比现有方法在有效性和效率上更优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化神经网络训练需要高效数据挑选，现有方法仍存计算和性能瓶颈。

Method: 利用预训练模型和谱分析，动态调整数据点选择比例，采用Fiedler向量评分机制过滤训练数据。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS显著降低计算需求（最高减少4倍），并提升精度和泛化性能。

Conclusion: GSTDS展示了基于谱分析的数据选择在资源高效深度学习中的潜力，为自适应数据管理探索指明方向。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大网络和有标签数据集，不利于资源受限平台的使用，因此需要一种高效并且无需大规模监督的低光增强方法。

Method: 设计了只需两层卷积的特征提取器与无参数迭代恢复模块，同时提出了融合多种损失的无监督训练目标。

Result: 在LOL数据集上，LiteIE的PSNR达到了19.04 dB，比SOTA高1.4 dB，且参数占用仅为其0.07%；在Snapdragon处理器上以30FPS处理4K图像。

Conclusion: LiteIE是一种高效且实用的解决方案，可在资源受限的边缘设备中实时执行低光增强任务。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates
dependence on large-scale supervision and generalizes well across diverse
conditions. We design a backbone-agnostic feature extractor with only two
convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

Motivation: 当前3D纹理生成受限于高质量数据集的缺乏以及现有方法中错误累积和空间不一致问题，作者希望解决这一限制。

Method: 提出SeqTex框架，将UV纹理生成任务重新模型化为序列生成问题，并通过视频基础模型的视觉知识进行直接生成，设计了多分支架构、几何注意力对齐机制和自适应分辨率策略。

Conclusion: SeqTex充分利用了预训练视频模型的视觉先验，提供了无需后处理的高保真UV纹理生成，为3D纹理生成领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Motivation: 现有基准需优化以支持医疗教育中的深层、多语言和多模态视频理解需求。

Method: 设计M3-Med基准，包括多跳推理任务以及两个具体任务(TAGSV和TAGVC)，并用多种现有AI模型进行了评估。

Result: 评估显示现有AI模型在复杂多跳问题上的表现远低于人类专家，特别是在跨模态深度推理能力方面。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了现有AI模型的不足，为改善AI在专业领域中的应用提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2通过优化量化框架和方法，显著提升了极低比特量化扩散模型的性能，为生成任务量化研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet数据集上的实验表明，LEAwareSGD在低数据条件下提升了最多9.47%的泛化性能。

Conclusion: LEAwareSGD通过维持训练过程在"混沌边缘"的关键状态，显著提升了单域泛化模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The
dataset and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流引起的图像质量下降影响了目标分类与场景跟踪的准确性，亟需解决视觉清晰度和目标检测的限制。

Method: 设计了端到端框架，基于3D Mamba结构处理时空畸变，结合AT减弱器和目标检测器，利用特征互通优化检测性能。

Result: 框架在模拟湍流数据集上优于现有方法，提升了湍流图像的识别性能，改善幅度最高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT框架有效减弱了大气湍流对图像与目标检测的影响，同时提高了视觉质量和检测准确性，为大气条件下的目标识别提供新思路。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图表征的LLM框架，用于改进CT数据的医疗影像视觉问答（VQA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间的相关性，导致回答缺乏连贯性和准确性。

Method: 将CT切片与问题token建模为图的节点，通过注意力图卷积网络融合跨模态信息，并将其作为提示引导LLM生成答案。

Conclusion: 本文所提框架改进了现有医疗影像VQA方法的连贯性和响应精准性，为复杂影像数据的临床应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出首个通过纯Mamba模块实现高效密集全局融合，且在相机-LiDAR多模态3D目标检测中达到顶尖性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前融合策略无法同时兼顾效率、长距离建模，以及保留场景完整信息。为此需要一种新的融合方式。

Method: 基于状态空间模型(SSMs)和线性注意力的最新进展，设计了一种可保留高度信息的LiDAR编码方法，并引入Hybrid Mamba模块实现局部与全局上下文学习。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上以75.0的NDS得分达到最优性能，且推理速度快于多数最新方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法在有效性与效率之间取得平衡，并超越使用高分辨率输入的现有方法，展现了多模态融合的潜力。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务算术框架的迁移方法，将自解释模型的视觉可解释性从源领域迁移到目标领域，并验证其有效性和普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分类中，同时需要预测和高效解释，自解释模型尽管有效却存在高昂的训练成本。该研究旨在降低这种训练成本。

Method: 通过基于视觉语言预训练模型扩展图像分类器，构建自解释模型，并定义“可解释性向量”，利用任务算术框架实现从源到目标领域的可解释性迁移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可有效在不同数据集之间迁移视觉可解释性，提升目标领域解释质量且不影响分类准确性，且在ImageNet等大规模数据集上训练的可解释性向量在其他数据集上具有普适性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持分类性能的基础上，通过单次模型推断即可实现可与Kernel SHAP媲美的解释质量，为迁移学习和自解释模型开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Conclusion: CoIBA通过在多层共享相关信息显著改善了特征归因的解释性能，为更全面理解决策过程提供了新思路。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sat2City框架克服了现有方法的限制，实现了基于卫星影像的城市比例3D模型高质量生成，为数字孪生和其他领域的研究提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计模型对3D监督依赖性高，且存在泛化问题，尤其在室外无界领域的深度估计可能失误，因此需要改进NeRF的深度正则化方法。

Method: 利用低级颜色特征与基础模型高层特征的结合，计算视图一致性分布；通过从该分布采样，结合深度推送损失，共同对NeRF的训练进行隐式正则化。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在生成新视点合成结果方面显著优于现有最先进的NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 所提视图一致性分布及其相关正则化方法有效提升了NeRF在各种场景中的表现，显现出其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Conclusion: MVNet高效整合技术，能够更好地处理复杂的高光谱图像数据。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

Method: 构建了SFOOD基准，包括收集食品光谱图像、实验确定食品属性如甜度和重量，并组织了3,266个食物类别和2,351k数据点的相关信息。

Result: 发现大型模型仍难以准确数字化食品，表明食品属性分析的挑战性，同时强调频谱数据在分析甜度等属性中的重要性。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并进行持续更新，为食品分析任务提供一个新的方向。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文本到图像生成（T2I）模型在复杂场景的空间组合方面表现不佳。CoT-Diff通过将多模态大语言模型（MLLM）驱动的3D布局规划与扩散过程紧密结合，引入逐步推理，显著提高了场景空间对齐与组合的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型在复杂场景中的空间对齐表现有限，现有基于布局的方法缺乏动态布局优化能力，因此需要更有效的模型来实现精确空间控制和语义注入。

Method: 提出CoT-Diff框架，引入MLLM驱动的3D布局规划和逐步COT风格推理，将布局动态更新融入扩散过程；将更新的布局转化为语义条件和深度图，通过条件感知注意机制融入生成模型。

Result: 在3D场景基准测试中，CoT-Diff在复杂场景空间精度上超越现有方法34.7%，显示了其优越性。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff推导了一种紧密结合推理和生成的新型T2I框架，显著提升了复杂场景生成的空间对齐和组合效果，验证了其新型生成范式的有效性。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BiVM的高效实时视频抠图二值化神经网络，通过改进编码器和解码器的结构来显著提升准确性和效率，同时大幅节省计算和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度神经网络在边缘设备上进行实时视频抠图应用时，因计算量大而受限，因此需要高效的二值化方法以突破这一瓶颈。

Conclusion: BiVM在保持高准确性的前提下，实现了高效视频抠图的二值化，且具有广泛的边缘设备应用前景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 开发一种无需额外训练即可在生成中控制内容和风格的图像生成方法，以提高推理效率和通用性。

Method: 采用三路径设计（内容、风格、生成），结合文本提示，实现灵活的语义控制；引入了关键阶段注意力共享和自适应查询共享机制，以优化内容和风格的对齐及内容语义的增强。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需额外训练，具备高效语义控制和灵活性，为风格个性化图像生成提供了一种新颖的实现方式。

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的方法在单场景中回归相机位姿，缺乏对多样化环境的泛化和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型(VLM)的世界知识，并结合多模态数据和自然语言指导多场景学习。

Result: 实验显示MVL-Loc在7Scenes与Cambridge Landmarks数据集上实现了多场景相机重定位的最先进性能，具有更高的定位精度。

Conclusion: 所提框架在多场景6-DoF相机重定位中具有显著的性能提升，并展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种创新的基于CLIP模型的框架，通过引入"强制提示学习"(Forced prompt learning, FA)方法，显著提升了OOD检测性能，而无需依赖外部数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的OOD检测方法存在泛化性有限或依赖大规模外部数据集的问题。该研究旨在充分利用ID知识，以提高OOD检测效果。

Method: 提出了一种强制提示学习（Forced prompt learning, FA）的方法，通过学习更加多样化和丰富的ID类描述，增强ID图像与可学习提示之间的语义相似性，并引入强制系数以帮助提示学习更全面的ID类描述。

Result: 在无需外部辅助数据集的情况下，FA方法在OOD检测中取得了显著提升，且相比CoOp模型保持了相同的可训练参数量。

Conclusion: FA方法无需外部辅助数据集即可达到当前最先进的OOD检测性能，展示了其卓越的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

Conclusion: 新方案为手势生成和多模态交互研究奠定了基础，显著推动了空间感知的手势生成领域的发展。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于实时数据选择的方法，用于通过对象级别的新颖性检测构建更平衡多样化的数据集，从而提升自动驾驶系统感知模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶数据集中罕见事件和对象常被低估，导致模型泛化能力不足和安全性降低，需要一种机制有效捕获新奇数据并减少冗余。

Method: 提出一种实时数据选择方法，通过动态均值漂移算法，为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性评分，以检测包含新对象的帧，并过滤掉冗余数据帧。

Result: 减少冗余后训练模型的性能得到提升，随机采样效率有限且结果不可预测，而更积极的数据过滤在冗余增加时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 方法支持实时部署（32帧/秒），能动态更新正常内容定义，在连续数据流中高效检测新颖数据，为创建更多样化的训练集和提高模型性能提供工具。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive
generative modeling due to the high dimensionality of video data. This work
introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2展示了多模态嵌入模型的良好泛化能力，并为研究和实际应用中的统一嵌入学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为S$^2$Edit的方法，可在预训练的文本-图像扩散模型基础上，进行高质量、个性化的语义与空间控制图像编辑，特别适用于面部编辑等需要精细控制的任务。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的图像生成与编辑技术，在执行需要精确控制的任务时，比如面部编辑，往往会丢失细节或对无关区域造成修改，影响了编辑质量。

Method: 提出的S$^2$Edit方法通过微调模型，将身份信息嵌入可学习的文本标记中，并在语义空间中引入正交性约束以区分身份与需编辑的属性。此外，使用目标掩码引导模型的跨注意力映射，实现对目标区域的局部化编辑。

Conclusion: S$^2$Edit方法实现了精确语义和空间控制的图像编辑，能够保护原始身份信息，同时实现语义解耦与局部控制，为图像编辑任务带来显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于时空事件图的视频描述生成方法，并验证其在多个数据集上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频描述数据集中对自然语言长段落的描述稀缺，且生成复杂语言描述的难度较高。

Method: 通过构建时空事件图作为视觉与语言的共享表示，整合多种视觉任务生成自然语言描述，并通过自动化过程训练神经网络模型。

Result: 提出的方法可生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述，并在多个数据集上通过标准评估指标、人类注释和VLMs集成验证其效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅生成解释性强的长段视频描述，还能充当自动化教师提升端到端模型性能。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出QR-LoRA框架，通过QR分解进行结构化的参数更新，实现对视觉特性的高效分离。实验表明，在内容-风格融合任务中性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型中多个LoRA模型融合时特性纠缠的问题，改进参数更新方法以更高效地分离视觉属性。

Method: 采用QR分解的方式，将参数分解为正交矩阵Q和上三角矩阵R，并在固定两者的基础上仅训练任务特定的Delta R矩阵，减少参数量并提升特性解耦性能。

Result: 实验展现了QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中优越的性能，能够实现更好的特性解耦并减少模型参数。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA框架提供了一种新的参数高效解耦微调范式，显著改善了生成模型的内容-风格融合效果。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HiLa的框架，通过预训练特征提取、语言提示优化和视觉语言对齐提升癌症生存期预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症生存期预测方法受限于稀疏的切片级标签，无法充分学习区分性强的表征，而现有视觉语言方法尚未有效应用于生存预测。

Method: HiLa框架通过分层特征提取生成切片和区域级别的视觉特征，并采用描述生存相关属性的语言提示，结合优化语言提示和对比学习促进视觉语言对齐以及跨层次信息交互。

Result: 模型在三个TCGA数据集上取得了SOTA的实验性能。

Conclusion: HiLa有效解决了现有方法的视觉语言对齐不足和分层相互作用建模问题，显著提高了癌症生存期预测的表现。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReLoop的闭环训练框架，旨在通过多种一致性反馈机制减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的幻觉生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉问答任务中容易产生与输入语义不符的幻觉输出，亟需一种内建机制来在训练过程中直接验证输出的真实性。

Method: 引入ReLoop，一个闭环训练框架，采用环形结构整合三种一致性反馈机制（语义重构、可视化描述、注意力监督），增强语义可逆性、视觉一致性和注意力可解释性，以纠正模型输出。

Result: 通过广泛的基准测试表明，ReLoop能显著降低多模态大语言模型的幻觉生成率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为解决多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了一种有效且可靠的方法，相关代码和数据将在正式版本中公开。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

Result: 实验显示，所提方法能有效提高模型性能，同时将实现高准确率所需的训练成本减少了一半。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升模型性能和效率的同时，也为解决误导性标注问题提供了有效方案，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文旨在解决文本到图像扩散模型中的“幻觉”问题，通过引入认知灵感的视角，并提出一种动态向量工具ARC和相应的控制器方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型生成的内容经常与输入语义失效，即出现“幻觉”问题，这种问题表明生成过程内存在结构性错配。

Method: 本文将生成视为一种多轴认知张力场，提出一个名为“幻觉三维空间”的框架，并通过动态向量工具‘Alignment Risk Code (ARC)’量化这一张力场，还设计了基于ARC信号的轻量级控制器TM-ARC，动态干预生成过程。

Result: 在标准的文本到图像基准上，本文引入的TM-ARC显著降低了生成过程中的“幻觉”问题，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解扩散模型生成失效问题提供了统一且可解释的解决方法，具有广泛的意义。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的立体匹配网络受限于领域迁移和视差分布问题，缺乏鲁棒性，难以在多数据集间表现良好。引入视觉基础模型提升鲁棒性，但其在立体匹配任务中的集成存在挑战。

Method: 提出SMoEStereo框架，采用MoE-LoRA模块和MoE-Adapter模块分别动态选择专家并优化提取几何特征，通过轻量决策网络根据输入复杂度选择性激活MoE模块以平衡效率和精度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多项基准测试中实现了跨领域和联合泛化的最优性能，无需数据集特定的适配。

Conclusion: SMoEStereo框架通过创新性集成VFMs改进了立体匹配的泛化能力及效率，为跨领域应用和符合多样化场景打下基础。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: 对答能力对齐框架显著增强了视频大语言模型处理实际场景中复杂问题的能力，尤其是在评估问题相关性和拒绝超出范围问题方面，展示了其重要意义。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Motivation: 传统方法在轨迹预测中难以捕捉时空依赖关系，尤其是局部时间依赖和高阶运动状态特征未被充分考虑。

Method: 提出LTMSformer框架，包括本地趋势感知注意力机制、运动状态编码器和轻量级提议细化模块，改善时空交互特征提取。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，与HiVT基线模型相比，minADE减少约4.35%，minFDE减少约8.74%， MR降低20%，且模型参数规模减少68%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer显著提升了轨迹预测性能，同时保持轻量级模型设计，显示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

Motivation: 生物医学数据样本不均衡且隐私限制严重，影响机器学习模型开发；生成合成图像可缓解相关问题。

Method: 使用基于LoRA权重微调的stable diffusion模型生成以少量真实样本为指导的高质量合成白血球图像，并辅以ResNet和CLIP分类器进行评估。

Result: 将5000张合成图像加入不平衡数据集后，ResNet分类器准确率从27.3%提高至78.4%，CLIP分类器从61.8%提高至76.8%。

Conclusion: 合成图像可以显著提升模型性能，增强数据集表现，推动生物医学研究发展，提高诊断与分析能力。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Method: 提出MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA)机制，同时进行模态内细化和模态间互动，并通过correct-after-align策略解耦模态对齐和跨层token混合，同时采用自适应屏蔽注意力以提高模型的灵活性。

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验表明，MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: MODA机制有效解决了跨模态注意力问题，提升了多模态语言模型的认知和情感理解能力，并具备广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Motivation: 当前的历史文档修复方法多集中于单一模式或有限规模的修复，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出的AutoHDR通过三阶段方式模仿历史学家的修复流程，包括OCR驱动的损伤定位、视觉-语言交互的文本预测以及自动回归样式恢复。此外，它具有模块化架构，支持人机协作。

Result: 实验显示AutoHDR在修复严重受损文档时，OCR准确率从46.83%提升至84.05%，在人机协作模式下进一步提升至94.25%。

Conclusion: AutoHDR代表了自动历史文档修复的重要进展，为文化遗产保护作出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and
dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 本论文提出VectorLLM，这是一个多模态大型语言模型，用于从遥感图像中提取建筑轮廓，能够直接进行逐点角点回归，相较于传统多阶段方法提升了性能和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动提取建筑轮廓的方法依赖复杂的多阶段管道，限制其可扩展性和实际应用。本文受到大型语言模型推理能力的启发，旨在开发一种精准高效的遥感建筑轮廓提取方法。

Method: 提出了VectorLLM，通过角点逐点回归直接进行建筑轮廓提取，该模型包括视觉主干、MLP连接器以及增强空间理解能力的位置嵌入等部分，并探索了预训练、监督微调和偏好优化等多种训练策略。

Result: VectorLLM在WHU、WHU-Mix和CrowdAI三大数据集上的表现分别超过SOTA方法5.6 AP、7.1 AP和13.6 AP，并在飞机、水体和油罐等其他物体的零样本任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: VectorLLM展示了大型语言模型在遥感轮廓提取中的潜力，提出了一种新范式，实现了高精度和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

*Hahyeon Choi,Junhoo Lee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR 是一个新的视频音频定位基准，TAVLO 是相应的模型，重点关注时间动态性，提高了AVL模型在视频场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频视觉定位研究忽视了时间动态特性，同时假设单一且简单的场景，不能适应更复杂的应用环境。

Method: 提出了一个视频中心的AVL基准（AVATAR），包含四种复杂场景，同时提出新模型TAVLO，能显式整合时间信息以提升性能。

Result: 传统方法难以捕捉时间变化，TAVLO通过高分辨时间建模实现了更精准的音频视觉匹配。

Conclusion: 时间动态性在AVL中至关重要，TAVLO和AVATAR设立了视频中心AVL的新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Motivation: 探索将基于验证性奖励的强化学习原则从单一语言模型转移到多模态语言模型，以实现高级的视觉推理能力。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段的训练范式：冷启动式的大规模语言微调，随后进行跨近1000步的大规模多模态强化学习，在Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型上实施。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Motivation: 肖像图像的阴影移除往往面临面部身份篡改、颜色失真和细节丢失等问题，当前方法难以同时解决。

Method: 首先，使用包含不同光照条件的真实场景数据训练阴影无关的结构提取网络生成包含细节的结构图；其次，利用结构引导的扩散模型进行阴影移除；最后，通过阴影区域内的梯度指导，使用扩散模型恢复细节。

Conclusion: 本文方法结合结构提取与扩散模型，成功解决肖像阴影移除中的多个关键问题，为高质量图像修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法能够以较少的训练数据相比现有方法显著提升视觉推理能力，为模型的组合推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Tempo-R0，一种基于多模态时间感知增强的多模态大型语言模型，目的是解决基于语言查询的视频时间片段定位任务。在相关基准测试中，其性能优于现有方法约3.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频信息量和冗余量较大，准确从中提取与查询相关的片段需要深刻理解整个视频内容。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）优化帧内容变化时的注意力利用；使用显性时间戳模式对齐（ETA）加强模型对视频事件边界的感知；在微调阶段引入基于部分无关性拒绝的组相对策略优化（PIR-GRPO）以增强时间推理能力。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试基准及其经过改正的版本中，该模型在准确率上比现有方法提升约3.5%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，通过多模态时间感知增强，Tempo-R0模型对视频查询任务具有显著性能提升，在视频理解领域展示了较高的应用潜力。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

Conclusion: GeoSapiens证明了少样本学习框架在牙科标志点检测任务中的有效性，同时验证了几何损失函数在捕捉解剖几何关系上的重要作用。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Result: 在多个GCD基准测试中，该方法显著提升了新类别分类准确率，表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于NC-GCD框架的方法能够改善新类别性能问题，证明其在GCD问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ControlNet在依赖公开数据集时可能面临的潜在数据中毒风险，评估这种威胁对图像生成模型的影响。

Method: 通过植入触发器与NSFW目标的中毒样本，使模型在保持生成干净图像的同时，在特定触发条件下生成目标内容图像。

Result: 在高质量的大规模数据集上，该攻击表现出高成功率，同时对原始输入的改动不可察觉。

Conclusion: ControlNet面临潜在的隐秘数据中毒威胁，需要更加严格的数据清理和防御机制。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文探讨在制造领域使用视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行零样本文本到图像检索，提出基于多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的自动注释流水线生成文本描述，并评估CLIP、LAION-CLIP及Meta的Perception Encoder三个模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对制造领域中产品信息由视觉及文本构成的特性，提升跨模态检索效果，特别是在无公开数据集和零样本情境下进行探索。

Method: 通过自动化注释流水线使用多模态语言模型生成两种类型文本描述：自然语言文本和结构化属性描述，并使用CLIP、LAION-CLIP和Perception Encoder进行性能评估。

Result: 结构化、属性丰富的文本描述显著提升了复杂织物类别的检索准确性，Meta的Perception Encoder因其出色的特征对齐能力表现最佳。

Conclusion: 零样本检索在细粒度领域仍具挑战，需要域适应方法支持。技术性文本描述与先进VLMs结合是优化工业领域跨模态检索的关键。

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Saliency Benchmark (SalBench)的新基准，用于评估大规模视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 在检测人类显著视觉特征上的能力。研究表明，LVLM在识别简单视觉异常方面表现较差，如GPT-4o的准确率仅为47.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型对基础的显著特性检测能力较少研究，而这些特性与人类视觉处理密切相关，因此需要一个专门的基准来评估模型在这方面的表现。

Method: 设计了一个基准SalBench，包含聚焦于低层次视觉特性的图像，如颜色、强度和方向，并提出了三种新任务：Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out 和 Visual Referring Odd-One-Out，用于全面评估LVLM的感知能力。

Result: 通过综合评估表明，LVLM在处理简单的视觉异常任务上表现有限，其中最先进的GPT-4o模型在相关任务的准确率仅为47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench为测量LVLM在符合人类注意力微妙定义上的能力提供了重要工具，同时揭示了当前LVLM在视觉异常检测中的重要局限性。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从2D图像中分离出几何、材质和光照的逆渲染中不适定问题，为生成高质量的3D模型和材质分解提供新方法。

Method: 通过联合优化神经SDF、预测材质参数的神经场和一个捕捉未知环境光的MLP模型，利用基于物理的可微渲染层连接3D属性与输入图像，并引入一系列物理先验与几何正则化约束问题。

Result: MatDecompSDF 在几何精度、材质真实性和视图合成方面优于先进方法，同时生成的模型可编辑、可重光照，可无缝集成到图形管道中。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了几何与材质分解问题，生成的结果验证了其实用性，为数字内容创作提供了直接支持。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在PIV领域中，深度学习模型的性能因缺乏标准化的基准数据集和科学评价体系而难以比较，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 构建了一个大规模的合成PIV基准数据集，并开发了MCFormer深度网络架构，结合多帧时间序列信息和多成本体积，针对PIV的稀疏特性进行了优化设计。

Result: 通过全面的基准数据评估研究，发现现有光流模型在PIV上的表现存在显著差异，MCFormer模型表现优异，达到了最低的标准端点误差（NEPE）。

Conclusion: 此研究为未来的PIV研究提供了重要的基准资源和一种高性能解决方案，显著提升领域中的研究与应用水平，并通过公开数据集与代码促进更多未来研究。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种在3D LiDAR场景中，基于最小二乘图的多代理对抗边界框跟踪框架，以缓解对抗性噪声的影响，并通过评估展示了其显著的性能改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一代理跟踪虽然能提供对抗攻击的韧性，但缺乏情境意识，因此有必要通过多代理协作提升环境理解与鲁棒性。

Method: 采用最小二乘图方法，利用差分坐标和锚点，通过完全连接的图对多辆车的对抗性边界框进行融合和优化，并结合多阶段跟踪进一步减弱对抗威胁。

Result: 在V2V4Real真实世界数据集上的评估显示，该方法在具有挑战性的对抗条件下性能比最先进的单代理和多代理追踪框架最高优于23.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架是一种无需额外防御机制的弹性方法，在对抗性场景下显著提高了多物体跟踪的准确性和定位能力。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GraphBrep的模型，用于直接生成B-Rep，以减少数据冗余，提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将拓扑信息嵌入几何特征中，导致数据冗余，并带来高计算成本，因此需要开发一种更加紧凑、高效的B-Rep生成方法。

Method: 设计了一个名为GraphBrep的模型，通过构造无向加权图明确表示并学习B-Rep的拓扑结构，并采用图扩散模型在表面特征的基础上学习拓扑连接关系。

Result: 在两种大规模无条件数据集和一个类别条件数据集上的实验表明，与现有技术相比，该方法在保持高质量CAD生成的同时，将训练时间缩短了31.3%，推理时间缩短了56.3%。

Conclusion: GraphBrep模型大幅提升了生成效率，并维持了生成的CAD模型的高质量，通过显式学习紧凑拓扑结构，在降低计算资源消耗的同时表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Conclusion: 本研究填补了法律和技术领域在AI艺术版权问题上的空白并强调了其社会意义，为相关政策制定和技术发展提供支持。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法无法充分优化网络效率和性能，因此需要一种更加精细的剪枝方法。

Method: 设计了逐步通道剪枝框架，采用尝试-选择-剪枝三步策略，并支持深度迁移学习中的跨域数据优化。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，与现有的通道剪枝方法相比，无论是监督学习还是迁移学习，PCP框架在加速网络的同时表现出色。

Conclusion: PCP框架在减少准确性损失的前提下显著提升了网络效率，为包括迁移学习在内的深度学习提供了一种新颖的通道剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Result: 实验验证了PointGAC在各种下游任务中的有效性，提出的维护机制增强了语义特征学习效率。

Conclusion: PointGAC 改进了点云掩蔽建模，能够有效捕获广义特征并提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种名为UDF-GMA的新方法，用于自动化广义运动评估，通过模型的不确定性建模提高了预测准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于姿态的自动化广义运动评估方法由于高质量数据的缺乏和噪声问题，存在较大的不确定性，影响了其临床可靠性。

Method: UDF-GMA通过显式建模模型参数中的认知性不确定性和因数据噪声引发的异质性不确定性，共同分解这些不确定性，并结合贝叶斯近似估计参数不确定性。此外，提出将这些不确定性与嵌入的运动表示相融合，以增强类别区分能力。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法准确预测低表现序列的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过综合不确定性建模和运动嵌入，显著提升了自动化广义运动评估的效果，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，SeqGrowGraph方法展现了最先进性能。

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph能够有效捕捉实际复杂路网结构，提供更精确的车道拓扑建模方案。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RIPE提出了一个基于强化学习的新框架，可弱监督训练关键点提取器，具有检测和描述任务能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的关键点提取训练依赖于人工变换、预生成模型或3D数据，提出RIPE以降低监督需求并扩展训练数据范围。

Method: RIPE无需传统重依赖的监督，仅需二元标签，通过中间层编码器和超列整合不同尺度信息，并引入辅助损失增强描述符辨别能力。

Result: RIPE在标准基准测试中表现卓越，数据准备更简化，同时性能与前沿技术持平。

Conclusion: RIPE简化数据需求，提升了关键点提取和描述性能，对相关研究具有推动意义。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CMET的全新度量方法，用于衡量数据嵌入的质量，以解决现有方法计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据嵌入质量比较方法在时间和空间复杂度上较高，因此需要一种高效可靠的度量工具。

Method: 提出了一种全新度量方法CMET，由两个得分CMET_L和CMET_G组成，分别衡量局部和全局结构保存能力。

Result: 在四种合成数据、两种生物数据和两种图像数据上验证了CMET的效果，其性能优于最新方法，表现出低算法复杂度和稳定性。

Conclusion: CMET是一种可靠灵活的工具，可用于不同数据规模和超参数选择的情况下进行嵌入质量评估。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习超分辨率模型需要区域性的高分辨率观测数据进行再训练，而这些数据分布不均，限制了模型的地理泛化能力。

Method: 引入名为RainShift的数据集和基准，用以评估气候模型在地理分布转移条件下的下采样能力，并测试现有模型（如GAN和扩散模型）的泛化表现。

Result: 结果显示，模型在地域分布不一致的区域中性能大幅下降，但扩展训练数据域和数据对齐等方法对改进这种表现有效。

Conclusion: 数据分布不均对高分辨率气候信息的获取造成了不公平，研究建议通过改进方法提升模型在地理分布转变下的泛化能力，从而促进全球气候模型的公平使用。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在公开数据集上的性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法利用因果推断和反事实推理，增强了TSG任务的可靠性和泛化能力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click框架为目标感知的音频生成提供了一种创新且实用的解决方案，在精度和性能上表现显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Motivation: 解决多视图3D编辑的一致性不足问题，以及全文本提示编辑控制灵活性差的问题。

Method: 开发了一种基于CLIP的语义一致性选择策略，结合注意力融合网络，通过用户选择关键视图，利用3D几何一致性优先策略实现高质量编辑。

Result: 实验表明，InterGSEdit在一致性和高保真度方面达到最优编辑性能，并显著提升用户体验。

Conclusion: 通过用户交互和注意力融合技术，InterGSEdit为高质量3D编辑提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

Motivation: 虽然扩散模型在处理视频插帧任务中表现出色，但现有方法要么忽视时间信息，要么存在规模和效率问题。因此需要一种能够有效整合时间信息且高效的方法。

Method: 提出了时间感知的Latent Brownian Bridge扩散模型 (TLB-VFI)，包含3D-wavelet gating和时间感知自动编码器，同时结合了光流引导机制，以减少数据需求和模型参数。

Result: 新方法在最具挑战性的数据集上相比于现有的图像扩散模型在FID上提升了20%，并在参数减少3倍的同时实现了2.3倍的加速。此外，与视频扩散模型相比，需要的训练数据减少9000倍，参数减少20倍以上。

Conclusion: TLB-VFI通过有效整合时间信息和参数优化，以较少的模型复杂度和训练需求实现了插帧任务上的卓越性能，为视频插帧领域提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are
available at our project page: https://zonglinl.github.io/tlbvfi_page.

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用文本增强多模态外科手术基础模型进行“安全关键视图”（CVS）识别的新方法，并通过文本提示和多标签适应策略提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前外科手术中的“安全关键视图”（CVS）识别依赖于视觉为主的模型，这需要大量的空间标注，耗时且成本高，现有多模态模型在此任务中表现有限。本文旨在通过引入文本模式改进CVS识别自动化。

Method: 提出了一个名为CVS-AdaptNet的多标签适应策略，将图像嵌入与文本描述对齐，通过正负提示提高多个CVS标准的二元分类精度，并基于PeskaVLP进行模型适配。

Result: 在Endoscapes-CVS201数据集上，CVS-AdaptNet实现了57.6 mAP，相较于仅使用图像的ResNet50基线（51.5 mAP）提升了6个百分点，表明文本促动的多模态框架在CVS识别任务中的优势。

Conclusion: 尽管与基于空间标注的最先进方法相比仍有差距，但CVS-AdaptNet表明通用模型可以通过适应策略用于专业化的外科任务。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

TL;DR: MML-SurgAdapt是一种使用视觉语言模型（VLMs）解决外科多任务问题的框架，能够处理不完整或嘈杂的标注，首次将SPML方法应用于多个外科任务数据的整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外科AI模型通常只针对单一任务，不够灵活；且不同任务数据常有部分标注的问题，造成集成学习困难。

Method: 采用基于视觉语言模型（CLIP）的多任务框架MML-SurgAdapt，引入单一积极多标签（SPML）学习方法，结合多个外科任务数据，并通过自定义提示实现学习。

Result: 在包含多个数据集的综合测试中（Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, CholecT50），MML-SurgAdapt表现与任务专用模型相当，并优于现有SPML框架，同时减少23%的标注需求。

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为多任务学习提供了新的普适性解决方案，减轻了临床标注负担，是首个将SPML用于多外科任务数据整合的方法。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Motivation: 现有研究中物体质量估计较少利用视觉传感器，而质量估计对机器人任务中的许多应用至关重要。

Method: 利用ShapeNetSem 3D模型生成合成RGBD数据集，训练图像生成模型估计稠密深度图，并结合稀疏点云与RGB图像进行质量估计。

Result: 新方法在所有评估指标上均显著优于现有的基准方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合稠密深度图和RGB数据，该方法在系统性和性能方面展示了优越的质量估计能力，提供了一个对机器人领域强有力的贡献。

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LVLMs可能生成与视觉内容不一致但表面合理的回答，存在影响实际应用的问题。作者发现，问题的根源在于LVLMs未能充分利用多模态交互信息，而人类则可通过分析多模态数据交互来形成理解并表达。

Method: 提出了一种无训练算法INTER，通过显式引导LVLMs重新应用多模态交互信息生成回答，降低幻觉现象，无需额外数据。

Result: 在VQA和图像描述任务的六个基准数据集上，INTER在五种LVLM中平均提高了3.4%，优于现有最优解码策略。

Conclusion: INTER有效减轻了LVLMs产生幻觉的现象，提升了解码效果并体现更接近人类认知的行为特点。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 随着视觉自回归模型进展迅速，数据隐私和版权问题成为重要担忧，推动了训练数据检测这一任务的兴起。

Method: 提出基于隐式分类和自适应分数聚合的检测方法，计算查询图像中的隐式分类分数并聚合，评估其更可能属于训练数据的概率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在类别条件和文本到图像场景中表现出色，且具有强健性和良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 发现了两个重要结论：1) 会员推断呈线性扩展规律，大型基础模型更易受攻击；2) Scale-wise视觉自回归模型的训练数据更易检测。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于GAN或UNet的扩散模型方法存在时序跳动、身份漂移和不自然眨眼问题，需要改进以生成一致且真实的面部动画。

Method: 提出了结合3DMM与扩散Transformer的框架MoDiT, 包括分层降噪策略、3DMM系数引入和改进的眨眼建模策略。

Result: 该方法成功缓解了时序跳动、改善了身份一致性并实现自然的眨眼行为。

Conclusion: MoDiT能够显著改进音频驱动的面部动画质量，取得更自然逼真的效果，适用于虚拟助手等应用领域。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Conclusion: VOTE框架展示了显著的效率与性能优势，特别是在推理速度和泛化能力上的提升，为未来研究提供了新的方向与工具。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: VERITAS框架在AI生成图像检测方面提供了高透明度的解决方案，为理解分类依据和提高用户信任开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D捕捉系统在高速场景中因低帧率输入导致重建效果不佳，亟需提升低帧率下的4D重建能力。

Method: 通过异步捕捉方式提升有效帧率（从25 FPS提升至100-200 FPS），结合基于视频扩散模型的生成方法修复由于异步捕捉带来的4D重建伪影问题。

Result: 实验显示，该方法相比同步捕捉显著提升了高速4D重建的质量，包括细节修复、时间一致性和整体重建精度。

Conclusion: 新提出的技术有效改进了低FPS摄像机在高速动态4D重建中的表现，为4D高速运动解析和逼真人体重建提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于物候的分类框架，以应对印度特伦甘纳邦稻米种植区的空间和时序异质性问题，在32个地区实现了93.3%的分类准确率，并成功映射出73万多公顷稻田。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的遥感方法难以有效处理碎片化农业景观的异质性，因此需要开发适应本地农业生态变化的监测方法。

Method: 设计了一种基于物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区进行逐区校准，以适应地方农业生态的时间和空间变化特点。

Result: 框架总体分类准确率达93.3%，与官方统计数据高度吻合（R^2=0.981），并成功映射732,345公顷稻田，揭示不同地区的农业周期差异及田块大小对遥感精度的影响。

Conclusion: 高级别的时空适应性分类框架可提高遥感监测在碎片化农业景观中的应用效果，为农业政策、粮食安全及操作监测提供重要支持。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

TL;DR: 提出VDG-Uni3DSeg框架，通过结合预训练视觉语言模型和大语言模型促进3D点云分割，提升了语义、实例和整体分割的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云的统一分割在场景理解中至关重要，但受限于点云稀疏结构、标注不足以及复杂环境中区分精细物体类别的挑战。现有方法监督不足，缺乏多模态信息，导致分类与实例区分能力不足。

Method: 通过预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）和大语言模型生成的文本描述结合互联网参考图像，引入多模态信息。同时设计语义-视觉对比损失以对齐点特征与多模态查询，利用空间增强模块高效建模全场景关系。

Result: 在语义分割、实例分割和全景分割领域均取得了最新的最先进表现。

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg展示了整合多模态信息提升3D分割能力的潜力，为语义、实例及全景分割提供了可扩展、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTA（跨任务对齐）的新方法，改进了测试时间训练（TTT）在分布变化情况下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在分布变化（如不同域或数据集）情况下性能下降，作者希望通过改进测试时间训练提升模型的稳健性。

Method: 作者提出CTA方法，将监督学习编码器与自监督学习编码器进行对齐，利用多模态对比学习的灵感，不需要特殊模型架构，同时进行测试时的语义更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提高了模型的稳健性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: CTA方法成功缓解了梯度干扰，并保留了自监督学习的稳健性，实现了更精确的测试时间更新，在分布变化情况下具有较强的表现能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低帧率无人机视频中的多目标跟踪由于对象外观和位置的快速变化以及图像退化等原因而极具挑战性，需要一种稳健的解决方案。

Method: 通过单帧标注进行实例关联学习，结合场景的全局特征，提升对干扰项的鲁棒性，并通过降低图像分辨率和表示大小提高推理速度。

Result: 验证了该方法在低帧率条件下的实例关联效果，且在减少分辨率和表示大小时仍能保持高质量的关联能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法适用于低帧率无人机视频的多目标跟踪任务，并提供了一个富有价值的军事车辆标注数据集。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology
(IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验数据分析中，信号内容经常被背景干扰和信号失真掩盖，需开发新的方法准确分离有效信号。

Method: 通过联合训练两个神经网络，一个用以近似物理信号失真，另一个学习背景贡献，基于重建损失函数，从原始数据中直接学习信号，无需标签。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据中，方法成功分离复杂背景与物理信号，即便信号在四维参数空间中具有显著变异性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架适用于广泛领域的信号分离问题，从天文测量到生物医学图像重建都可用。

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于一致性蒸馏的文本到3D生成方法由于自一致性和交叉一致性之间的不平衡，导致条件引导不足，生成结果亚最优。

Method: 提出SegmentDreamer框架，通过分段一致性轨迹蒸馏（SCTD）重新设计SDS方法，分割PF-ODE轨迹并确保每个子轨迹的一致性，同时开发了一套快速稳定的蒸馏流程。

Result: 实验表明，SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，能通过3D Gaussian Splatting生成高保真的3D资产。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过缓解一致性模型的不平衡问题，提升了文本到3D生成的效果，为高质量的3D资产创建提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Motivation: MLLMs在对环境和近期动作的综合理解能力上存在不足，而这一能力对于现实世界中的智能代理至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个大型数据集框架，名为REA数据集，提出了结合空间和时间理解能力的ST-LLM模型，通过设计特定投影器提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的ST-LLM模型在REA数据集上的表现相比以往方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: ST-LLM模型成功解决了MLLMs在时空理解上的主要挑战，为智能代理在现实环境中的应用提供了良好支持。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Motivation: 现有扩散图像编辑方法难以理解复杂间接指令，且存在身份保护差、编辑偏差或过度依赖手动蒙版等问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于MLLM的计划系统X-Planner，通过链式思考将复杂指令分解为简单的子指令，并为每个子指令生成精准的编辑类型和分割蒙版，减少人工干预，并提出用于大规模数据生成的自动化管道。

Result: X-Planner在现有基准和新提出的复杂编辑基准上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: X-Planner在提升复杂指令理解、身份保护及减轻用户干预方面表现出色，为文本指导图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced
text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect
instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity
preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing
model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Conclusion: LiMA在效率与效果之间取得了平衡，为自动驾驶场景中的LiDAR预训练带来新思路，并提供开源代码促进后续研究。

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

Method: 通过对ChatGPT（GPT-4）和Meta的Llama模型进行测试，使用2020年美国国家选举研究（ANES）中的问题对其在人类数据中的表现进行了比较分析。

Result: 发现LLMs的回应存在结构性不一致和严重的少数派意见同质化问题。

Conclusion: LLMs作为人类调查数据的直接替代工具具有重大局限性，可能加深刻板印象并误导政策制定。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

Conclusion: ProCI框架利用了LLMs的关键能力，在缓解隐藏混杂问题和提升因果推断性能方面表现优异，为使用LLMs解决因果推断问题提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在通用任务中表现卓越，但其在土木工程等专业领域的应用尚属空白，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 创建了一组包含8个梁分析问题的基准数据集，用于测试Llama-3.3 70B Instruct模型，并提出一种将结构分析重新框架为代码生成任务的方法，构建了一个基于LLM的智能代理。


Result: 实验结果表明，LLM智能代理在基准数据集上的准确率超过99.0%，在多种条件下表现出可靠性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合链式思维和少量示例提示生成并运行结构分析代码，可以显著提升LLMs在工程问题中的可靠性和鲁棒性，使其在专业领域的应用潜力得到验证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

Motivation: 通过利用范畴论的语言和工具，探讨并改进模型的组合推断能力和解释性，解决当前模型可能存在的过拟合和一般化能力不足问题。

Method: 利用范畴论提出通用框架，研究DisCoCirc框架中量子电路模型与传统神经网络在多个任务上的组合推断表现，对比其生产力、替代性和系统性，并分析过拟合趋势。

Result: 量子电路模型和神经网络在生产力和替代性任务上表现差距不大，但在系统性任务上差异超过10%。总体而言，神经网络更容易过拟合数据。此外，通过解析模型组件交互行为，揭示其运行机制。

Conclusion: 此研究证明DisCoCirc框架在提升组合推断能力上具有潜力，同时表明范畴论为模型解释性提供了有效工具，并指出需警惕神经网络的过拟合现象。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

Conclusion: 这一整合方法不仅尊重了传统智慧，还结合当代医学理解，展示了其在心理健康支持中的潜力。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架Radiant，通过优化检索到的证据与生成内容之间的对齐性，改进了当前大语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强设定下的事实一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升检索增强生成（RAG）的事实准确性和上下文一致性，解决LLMs中关于证据与生成响应整合不准确的问题。

Method: 引入新的指标Entity-Context Divergence (ECD)衡量从检索到的内容到生成内容的准确性，并提出Radiant框架，该框架基于Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）进行行为校正，从而优化LLMs的事实一致性表现。

Result: 实证分析表明当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低，而Radiant框架在多种检索场景下（如噪声网络内容、知识冲突及幻觉减少）成功提升了RAG性能。

Conclusion: Radiant框架通过对证据与生成内容的对齐性优化，显著增强了RAG的可靠性、一致性和事实准确性，为改进未来LLMs中的信息整合能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

Method: 采用GPT-4-turbo与Claude-3变体结合不同的提示策略，以及多种AI评价与模拟器，利用MITI手册由15名专业心理咨询师评估AI生成对话的质量。

Result: 发现结构化多步对话提示（SMDP）显著提升了咨询AI的表现，评估AI在一些特定指标上接近人类表现但存在系统性偏差，模拟的客户AI情感范围受限且服从性偏高。

Conclusion: 研究确立了AI辅助手段在非英语语境心理咨询中的基准，并指出了通过增强提示工程、检索增强生成和针对性微调以改进AI工具的潜力。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

Motivation: 针对当前大型语言模型容易生成幻觉或过时的响应，以及现有RAG方法在训练稳定性和推理效率上的不足，该论文提出解决方案。

Method: 通过设计RAG-R1训练框架，使模型在推理过程中自适应地利用内部和外部知识，此外，引入多查询并行模式以改善生成和检索效率。

Result: 在七个问答基准上的实验表明，该方法相比最强基线提升了最多13.2%的效果，并减少了11.1%的推理时间。

Conclusion: RAG-R1可以有效地提高LLMs的性能和推理效率，为增强型生成方法的发展提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型尽管表现卓越，但在进行网络安全分析时由于缺乏特定领域知识而表现不足。

Method: 通过领域自适应持续预训练(DAP)，使用126百万单词的网络安全数据集对三种解码器架构模型进行适配，采用约束训练参数和FSDP分布式训练法平衡领域专门化与知识保留。

Result: 在CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval三个测试中改进后模型表现出一致提升，Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP更是取得了新的准确率记录，显著超过多款专业化模型，同时有效利用了远小于竞品的数据集。

Conclusion: 研究证明了通过针对性持续预训练可以实现网络安全领域的有效适配，并在计算上可行，为开发专用AI助理提供了坚实基础，同时质疑了LLM专业化对数据需求的传统看法。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的隐私保护框架及改进的隐私与偏见敏感LLMs（PB-LLMs）不仅适用于简历评分，还具有普遍适用性。

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型需要大量计算资源，成本高昂，因此研究者致力于通过压缩技术降低其应用于数学教育的成本，为智能辅导系统提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过对BERT嵌入向量的压缩和蒸馏技术，提出了一个体积小且高效的学生模型，用于解决数学文字题（MWPs）。

Result: 学生模型在保持教师模型约90%性能的同时，只使用1/12的参数，且展现了广泛的任务泛化能力，证明模型压缩的原则具有通用性。

Conclusion: 嵌入向量的可压缩性主要源于词性信息而非实体识别，这一发现可提升效率与降低成本，为智能教育领域带来显著价值。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Conclusion: SMART框架显著提升了多模态大语言模型的推理能力，不受模型架构、参数规模或预训练数据集限制，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

*Seshu Tirupathi,Dhaval Salwala,Elizabeth Daly,Inge Vejsbjerg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一个名为GAF-Guard的框架，旨在用于LLM的治理，通过自主代理识别风险、激活相关工具并持续监控，确保AI的安全性和符合用户期望。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，对其进行严密监测以防止负面影响并确保其可靠性变得尤为重要。此外，需要设计方式使其与人类价值观一致，例如防止有害内容。

Method: 提出了一个名为GAF-Guard的创新框架，该框架通过自主代理从用户、使用场景与模型三个方面入手，识别和管理风险，实施部署后的风险监测，并提供持续的监测与报告功能。

Result: 提出的GAF-Guard有效地将用户需求、使用场景和模型风险纳入了LLM的监控与管理框架中，并提供开源代码供验证与应用。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard作为一个创新治理框架，为LLM应用的安全性与可控性提供了新途径，其灵活性和针对性使其适用于多种使用情景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文对手动、模式实例化和LLM生成的能力问题(CQ)进行了对比评估，显示LLM生成的CQ需要进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究知识工程过程中生成能力问题(CQ)的不同方法的特点及对比。

Method: 通过人为、CQ模式实例化、大型语言模型(LLM)等三种方法生成文化遗产需求的CQ，并从多个维度评估其特点和质量。

Result: 提出首个基于多注释者的数据集，系统对比了三种方法生成的CQ特点，发现LLM生成的CQ需要进一步完善。

Conclusion: LLM可作为初始生成CQ的工具，但需注意模型选择及后续精炼以适配实际需求。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过多步提示越狱绕过大语言模型（LLMs）内置的安全过滤机制，并评估了这些方法的广泛适用性和潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员旨在揭示当前LLMs在处理敏感内容（如自杀和自残）时，内置安全措施的脆弱性以及此类行为对实际安全部署的潜在影响。

Method: 采用多步提示操作（jailbreak）对六种主流LLMs进行测试，从而绕过其内置的内容安全过滤器，并详细评估越权生成的潜在危害内容。

Result: 结果显示，这种突破内置安全机制的方法具有普遍性和可靠性，能够生成可能导致现实世界伤害的有害信息。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs的技术水平难以保证在所有场景下的安全性，建议采用更系统的方式进行AI安全和伦理治理，同时强调持续的对抗性测试以改进模型的安全性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了11种大语言模型（LLMs）在医院出院小结中分类ICD-10代码的能力，发现最高F1分数未超过57%，表明其尚不足以进行完全自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探讨LLMs能否胜任医疗中关键但容易出错的ICD-10代码分类任务。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集中的1500份出院小结，提取医学术语后，设定一致的人工编码格式进行测试，比较含有推理功能和无推理功能的模型表现。

Result: 推理型模型总体表现优于非推理型模型，但表现最好模型的F1分数仅为57%，某些特定代码（如慢性心脏病相关代码）分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs可以为人工编码提供辅助，但目前尚不足以完全取代，需要进一步研究混合方法、领域专用模型训练以及结构化临床数据的利用。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Motivation: 传统方法在多语言模型微调中面临数据共享限制和语言本身差异的问题，尤其是低资源语言难以充分利用大模型的潜力。

Method: 提出联邦提示调优范式，通过高效参数调优，在不违反数据共享限制的情况下实现多语言模型的改进，设计了实验并使用语言距离分析方法评估效果。

Result: 相比传统方法，该方法在低资源语言上提高了6.9%的准确率，同时具备更高的数据效率、稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 方法有效促进了语言的平等，支持低资源语言的发展，展示了多语言模型调优的新可能性。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs在协作训练环境中的性能，为隐私数据领域提供了一种可靠的数据质量控制手段。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前语言历史学中普遍采用的计算谱系方法需要专业的同源词注释，这种方法耗时且受限。本研究旨在探索替代方法。

Method: 提出了两种全自动方法：一种基于自动同源词聚类；另一种基于隐藏马尔可夫模型的多序列比对方法。两种方法均与专家分类和语言学数据进行对比评估。

Result: 发现基于多序列比对的推断方法不仅生成的语言谱系树与专家分类更一致，还能更好预测语言类型变化并提供更清晰的谱系信号。

Conclusion: 基于多序列比对的方法可作为传统依赖专家注解方法的有力替代，为语言谱系的全球化研究提供了可能性。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能设计出串通策略，绕过审计机制并实现隐秘的恶意活动。

Method: 令两个模型分别扮演策略生成方(P)和监控方(M)，它们独立设计兼容的子策略，目标是使M将经过后门处理的程序错误地分类为无害，同时识别其他后门程序为有害。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型在部分非显性信号情况下能够成功串通，尽管整体成功率较低且收敛性较差。

Conclusion: 即使在相隔离的条件下，语言模型可能偶尔通过观察隐性模式成功串通，这对安全防范工作提出新的挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型在多样化生成中常忽视上下文适切性，导致即使在提示中明确设定了属性，也会因过度多样化而修改不必要的特征。

Method: 本文引入DIVBENCH框架，通过系统评价现有模型的多样化表现，并结合上下文感知方法（如LLM指导的FairDiffusion和提示重写）进行优化。

Result: 研究发现，大部分T2I模型多样性较有限，而现有手段易导致过度多样化问题。提出的上下文感知方法显著提高了平衡表现。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的多样化方法可在避免过度多样化的同时提升语义保真度和平衡性，对T2I多样化生成具有显著改进作用。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: 将结构化工具调用和强化学习结合应用于表格问答，可以有效提高可扩展性与准确性，展示了较大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Motivation: 临床文档记录占用医生大量时间，而当前大型语言模型的隐私和计算成本问题限制了其在医疗领域的应用，本文旨在开发一种能在设备端运行的医学转录系统以解决上述问题。

Method: 利用Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT)和LoRA技术，对Llama 3.2 1B模型进行微调，训练数据包括1,500对合成的医学转录到结构化笔记的样本，并通过统计指标和临床质量评估进行性能测试。

Result: 优化后的模型在各项指标上显著优于原始模型。例如，ROUGE-1从0.346提高到0.496，BERTScore F1从0.832提高到0.866，临床质量评估中的误差减少且准确性提高。

Conclusion: 微调后的小型LLM结合设备端部署，既能提高医学转录的精确性，又能解决隐私保护和资源限制等问题，为医疗领域的AI技术应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的训练无关的解码策略——谨慎下一步预测(CNTP)，通过在高不确定性时进行多次采样并选择最低困惑度路径，大幅提升了解码性能，特别是在提出了与人类思考过程相似的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的热门LLM在测试问题中常因不确定性而导致次优表现，而现有的温度标定和核采样方法在平衡多样性与连贯性上表现不足。因此需要一种新策略提升对不确定问题的解码表现。

Method: 在解码过程中，当模型预测熵较高时，独立采样多次直到遇到标点符号后停止采样，选择最低困惑度路径作为最可能路径。采样次数与预测信心成反比，不确定性越高，采样次数越多。

Result: 实验显示，CNTP方法在LLM和MLLM上的性能显著优于现标准解码策略，并且结合自洽性后表现进一步提升。

Conclusion: CNTP潜力巨大，有可能成为显示一个主流LLM解码默认选择。代码已开放以供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is
available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

### [275] [Dynamic Long Short-Term Memory Based Memory Storage For Long Horizon LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03042)
*Yuyang Lou,Charles Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合BERT分类器和LSTM记忆模块的新框架Pref-LSTM，用于将记忆嵌入软提示注入冻结的LLM中，以实现较高效的用户偏好建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在长对话中实现个性化的需求增加，因此需要一种轻量、动态的方式有效存储和利用用户偏好记忆。

Method: 设计一种Pref-LSTM框架，BERT分类器用于识别用户偏好，LSTM记忆模块生成记忆嵌入，再通过软提示注入到LLM中进行推理，同时使用合成数据集进行训练。

Result: 虽然LSTM记忆编码器效果不佳，但BERT分类器在识别用户偏好方面表现良好，证明了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 结合偏好过滤和LSTM门控原理，能够无需大量开销和微调而实现可扩展的用户偏好建模。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为K-Function的框架，通过结合准确的子词转录、客观评分和可操作反馈来提升儿童语言评估的准确性和可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语言的自动评估因高音调、延长音素和数据稀疏问题面临挑战，需要新的方法提升评估效率和准确性。

Method: 构建了K-Function框架，核心是Kids-WFST，结合了Wav2Vec2音素编码器和Dysfluent-WFST进行音素相似性分析，能够针对儿童错误进行精确捕捉和解释。

Result: Kids-WFST在MyST数据集上实现了1.39%的音素错误率，在Multitudes数据集上实现了8.61%的错误率，相较于传统的贪婪搜索解码器分别提升了10.47和7.06个百分点。

Conclusion: 高精度的音素识别可以支持完整的诊断反馈回路，为大规模临床级语言评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

### [277] [Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047)
*Yutian Liu,Zhengyi Yang,Jiancan Wu,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个将因果推理应用于大语言模型(LLMs)的推荐框架CETRec，用于改进用户历史交互中的时间信息利用，从而提升推荐的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLMs的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的丰富时间信息，因而难以准确捕捉用户偏好随时间的演变和预测未来兴趣。

Method: 提出一种因果增强时间框架CETRec，利用因果推理原则来隔离时间信息对推荐结果的具体影响，通过反事实推理定量分析时间顺序对推荐的独特贡献，并设计出优化模型时间敏感性的反事实调优目标。

Result: 实验表明，CETRec能有效增强LLMs对绝对时间戳和相对顺序模式的识别能力，显著改善推荐性能。

Conclusion: CETRec通过反事实调优和因果分析，有效解决了LLMs在处理用户历史时间信息上的局限性，为时间序列推荐任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

TL;DR: 研究在机器学习(Machine Learning)和深度学习(Deep Learning)方法下，检测警察报告叙述中错误分类的交叉口相关交通事故的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交通安全研究中通过分析多格式数据以提高事故分类准确性和数据质量的关键缺口。

Method: 使用2019年爱荷华州交通部门的交通事故数据，比较了包括SVM、XGBoost、BERT和Albert模型在内的多个机器学习和深度学习模型的性能，并将其结果与专家评定进行校验。

Result: 发现虽然传统机器学习方法整体表现较好，但Albert模型获得了与专家分类的最高一致性(与专家1达73%的一致性，与原有表格数据达58%)，并显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 结合自动分类与专家审查的混合方法可以提高交通事故数据质量，对交通安全管理和政策开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义互操作性标准的实施成本高、技术复杂的问题，简化临床数据交换过程。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索生成提示，引导GPT-4o和Llama 3.2模型将表格字段映射到相应的HL7 FHIR资源。

Result: 基准测试中资源识别的F1评分达到100%，GPT-4o因包含FHIR资源模式在提示中表现优于Llama 3.2。在实际条件下准确率稍降至94%，但通过改进提示策略恢复了映射性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LLM驱动方法可以有效转换临床数据到HL7 FHIR格式，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础；未来工作将聚焦于模型微调、支持更多标准以及开发交互界面以提高验证与完善。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

*YuXuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ARF的新框架，用于强化学习模型的个性化训练，通过将用户反馈转化为连续偏好分数，并采用动态适配器追踪用户喜好变化，提高了模型的精确度和个性化适配能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数强化学习方法主要依赖二元偏好方法，这种方法尽管降低了标注成本，但需要大量人工参与，且主要捕获群体偏好而非个体偏好。

Method: 提出自适应奖励跟踪（ARF）框架，利用高精度情感分析器将用户反馈转换为连续偏好分数，并通过数据增强技术去偏和丰富反馈信号。此外，动态适配器偏好追踪器可实时更新用户偏好，使用新算法直接基于跟踪奖励优化模型。

Result: 在Qwen-2/2.5、Gemma-2和Llama-3.2上的实验证明，相比现有方法PPO和DPO，ARF分别提升了3.3%和7.6%。

Conclusion: ARF为强化学习语言模型提供了一种可扩展、个性化及低成本的解决方案，通过自主奖励建模实现更优的个性化效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVER是首个通过强化学习培养语言模型情感智能的框架，其显著提高了模型的情感能力和对话性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在逻辑和算法推理方面表现出色，但其情感智能明显落后，特别是在对话和情感理解领域的应用尚不深入。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，通过模拟用户生成可验证的情感反馈，利用强化学习优化语言模型的情感智能，具体方法包括PPO微调等。

Result: 采用RLVER对Qwen2.5-7B模型进行优化后，Sentient-Benchmark分数从13.3提高到79.2，并保留数学和编程能力。实验证明框架提升了多种对话能力，并揭示了一些模型间的性能差异与发展趋势。

Conclusion: RLVER框架为构建具有情感能力和广泛对话能力的语言模型提供了实用途径，特定策略和环境设置对模型表现有重要影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型在数学推理任务中的可靠性，提出可靠性评价方法并开发了ReliableMath数据集，发现当前模型对不可解问题的辨识度较低，并提出对小型模型的对齐策略以提升其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在推理任务中表现出色，但在面对不可解问题时常生成虚假的答案，因此需要系统性地研究其在数学推理任务中的可靠性。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的可靠性评价方法，将问题分为可解和不可解两类，并开发了ReliableMath数据集；此外，还研究了通过提示词引导和对齐策略来提升LLMs可靠性的方法。

Result: 实验证明，现有的大型LLMs难以辨别不可解问题并倾向于生成虚假答案，但通过使用可靠的提示词可以显著提升其处理不可解问题的表现；然而，小型LLMs的改进有限，需进一步调整模型对齐策略。

Conclusion: 通过更靠谱的提示词设计和对齐策略，大型LLMs在数学推理中的可靠性有所提高，小型LLMs的可靠性表现提升显著，为提升LLMs在推理任务中的可信度提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型尽管在多种任务中的表现卓越，但仍存在社会偏见问题，尤其对受边缘化社区产生负面影响，研究低资源语言的偏倚问题对此具有重要意义。

Method: 本文对马耳他语的BERTu和mBERTu模型进行了研究，参考英语偏见评估和缓解方法，如CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准，以及一些偏见消减方法，包括数据扩充、随机失活正则化等，尝试将其应用于马耳他语环境中。

Result: 研究表明，现有的偏见缓解方法在应用于语言结构复杂的低资源语言时面临一定挑战，并创造了针对马耳他语的评估数据集。

Conclusion: 本文强调了为多语言自然语言处理开发更具包容性的方法的必要性，并为研究马耳他语中的性别偏见提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在临床环境中的使用越来越多，但其生成的医学文本的准确性和安全性评估主要依赖昂贵的医生人工审查，且现实中缺乏专家参考输出，需开发替代方法。

Method: 通过MedVAL框架，使用合成数据对评估语言模型进行自监督训练，从而检测生成医学文本中的事实一致性，同时引入MedVAL-Bench数据集进行性能验证。

Result: 实验显示，MedVAL框架在多种医学任务和语言模型中显著提高了与医生一致性，从平均F1得分66%提升到83%，并对最优专有模型提升了8%的性能。

Conclusion: MedVAL框架首次证明语言模型可以达到接近专家级的医学文本验证水平，为临床集成提供了可扩展和风险感知的路径，同时开源了相关资源促进社区研究。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (
https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing
open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching
expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Motivation: 研究旨在填补链式推理生成与越狱攻击之间关系的空白，探索模型在生成CoT令牌时的行为机制。

Method: 通过分析模型激活空间中的线性方向，研究“谨慎”方向如何预测模型的决定，并通过消融实验和攻击测试验证其有效性。

Result: 消融CoT级激活中的“谨慎”方向增加了有害顺从，证明链式推理生成可以成为攻击目标，并能提升攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 链式推理生成在模型安全领域中存在潜在的对抗操控风险，需更多关注其安全性问题。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs被广泛应用在医疗诊断支持、新闻事实核对等领域，其潜在偏见可能通过模型传递给用户，研究动机在于评估这些偏见的严重性和影响。

Method: 评估三种LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核对任务中的表现，量化其语境一致性、虚假生成的倾向，同时尝试18种缓解干预方法。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs在21.86%的案例中改变语境情感，57.33%生成基于知识截止后的虚假信息，存在5.94%的首效应偏见。某些针对性的干预方法被证明有效。

Conclusion: 由于LLMs在高风险领域的使用广泛性，研究强调需要更强的技术保障与以用户为中心的干预措施，旨在应对其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM技术支持的RAG系统在低资源环境下的高效检索至关重要。本研究提出KinyaColBERT模型，在Kinyarwanda语料上的性能超过基线模型和主流API。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低资源语言环境下，RAG系统检索精度低、成本高的问题，并避免LLM的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT检索模型，结合词级别交互和基于形态学的分词方法，配合两级Transformer编码产生细粒度上下文嵌入。

Result: KinyaColBERT在Kinyarwanda语料库农业检索基准测试中表现优越，超过强基线和商用文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: KinyaColBERT为低资源语言环境中可行、高效、成本节约的RAG系统提供了新思路，具备较强的推广潜力。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

TL;DR: RefineX是一种新颖的框架，通过程序化编辑任务进行大规模的训练数据精炼，同时保持数据的多样性和自然性，使得LLM的性能得到显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的预训练质量受到训练语料质量的高度影响，而大规模提升数据质量存在效率与效果之间的权衡。

Method: 提出RefineX框架，利用专家指导的高精度删除程序，训练出精炼模型，实现大规模、高效、细粒度的数据优化。

Result: 在多种模型规模下，从头训练的模型均表现优于使用原始或其他方法优化的数据的模型，750M模型在多任务上提升了2.6%-7.2%。

Conclusion: RefineX提供了一种可扩展、有效和可靠的解决方案，用于优化大语言模型的预训练数据。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种图增强的文档级翻译框架（GRAFT），通过结合分割、DAG依赖建模以及语篇意识提升翻译质量，在多个方向上取得显著进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档级翻译方法难以有效捕捉语篇现象，存在分段与一致性不足的问题。

Method: 引入GRAFT框架，结合LLM代理进行图增强的文档翻译，包括分割、DAG建模及语篇感知翻译。

Result: 在8种翻译方向与6个领域实验中，GRAFT对强Baseline平均提升2.8 BLEU分（TED测试集），对英中翻译提升2.3 BLEU分，表现优于当前文档翻译系统。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架能有效应对语篇现象，提供连贯且语境准确的翻译。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨如何为大型语言模型（LLMs）引入类似人类的“阅读”能力，以改进其文本理解和生成能力，提出了多种方法并展示了其显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通常缺乏类似人类的内部“阅读”或深思阶段，直接生成文本，而人类习惯于在沟通前进行内部反思。因此，研究希望通过引入类似的“阅读”能力，改进模型的理解深度和输出质量。

Method: 提出了多种引导LLMs“静默阅读”的方法，包括为模型提供初始情境提示或“阅读空间”，让其在生成文本前处理输入。此外，设计了一个“阅读伙伴”架构，由辅助组件对输入进行静默处理，并为主生成模型提供精炼的上下文见解。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法，包括简单的初始情境提示和“阅读伙伴”架构，显著提升了模型的准确性，在多个指标上实现了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入静默阅读训练和辅助机制，这些方法有效提升了LLMs的上下文理解和响应能力，推动LLMs向更类似人类的文本处理能力迈进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Method: 系统整合了两种预训练语音编码器（Whisper-large-v3和mHuBERT-147）与大语言模型（LLM），采用三阶段训练策略更新模型参数，并在输入端加入语言提示提升语言特定文本生成能力。

Result: 系统在挑战赛盲测试集上达到11.76%的CER/WER，比官方基线提升了8.41个百分点，且未增加基线训练数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的SHNU-mASR系统通过结合多模型架构与有效训练策略，实现了显著的性能提升，展示了多语言语音识别中的竞争优势。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial
markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles.
Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on
sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in
trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading
strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何检测维基百科中由大语言模型生成的低质量机器生成文本（MGT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成内容在维基百科平台上的增长，低质量文本可能影响该平台的可靠性，因此需要有效检测MGT。

Method: 引入名为WETBench的基准测试，专注于维基百科实际编辑任务，设计三种编辑任务：段落撰写、总结和文本风格转换。利用多语言数据集进行实验并评估探测器性能。

Result: 训练型探测器的平均准确率为78%，零样本探测器的平均准确率为58%。

Conclusion: MGT探测器在实际生成场景中表现不佳，说明需要使用多样、任务特定的数据对其进行可靠性评估。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

Method: 构建韩语句尾(KoSEnd)数据集，包括3,000个句子中的15种句尾形式的自然度注释，并评估了11个LLMs的表现。

Result: 通过分析参数数量及预测一致性，发现显式告知模型句尾缺失的可能性提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 特定语言特征的显式提示对改善 LLM 处理低资源复杂语言，如韩语的能力至关重要。

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Result: 实验表明LLMs能够一定程度上检测并修复错误，准确性和效率因模型而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在图修复上展示了潜力，但存在局限性，需要进一步研究以提升可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

Abstract: This article introduces semantically meaningful causal language modeling
(SMCLM), a selfsupervised method of training autoregressive models to generate

that the SMCLM approach makes autoregressive models capable of learning robust

the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics
that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects.
Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中SDoH数据不全影响健康研究与治疗，研究旨在通过自然语言处理方法解决这一问题。

Method: 训练Flan-T5-Large模型提取临床笔记中的社会历史信息，评估模型在SDoH类别识别以及细化信息提取的能力，并在多个数据集上测试性能。

Result: 模型对于记录充分的SDoH类别的识别表现较好（F1分数>0.80），但在数据少或表达复杂的类别中表现较差，并证明相比结构化EHR数据，模型显著提升了SDoH推断的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了在非英语EHR系统中利用NLP提升SDoH数据完整性的潜力，同时指出模型表现受制于注释不一致性等因素。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究仍主要以英语为中心，忽视了低资源语言的安全问题，而后者往往是语言模型安全性的“短板”。研究的动机在于从安全性角度关注低资源语言并探索如何在这些语言中改进LMs的安全性。

Method: 通过将现有的对抗攻击方法扩展至70种语言，对低资源与中资源语言的单语和多语语言模型进行安全性评估。

Result: 单语模型往往由于参数量不足而难以确保安全，多语模型虽有一定改进但也存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究提出在部署语言模型时，应特别关注低资源语言的安全性问题，并考虑现有多语模型的局限性，以促进多语言社区的语言模型安全性。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

Method: 基于RAG框架，并结合Agentic RAG的推理能力开发问答系统，并与移动应用集成，以实时提供疫苗信息。

Result: 研究表明，Agentic RAG在处理复杂医疗问题方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 新系统通过移动应用为临床提供即时访问疫苗信息的能力，提升了疫苗指南的可用性效能。

Abstract: Vaccination plays a vital role in global public health, yet healthcare
professionals often struggle to access immunization guidelines quickly and
efficiently. National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive
and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially
during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a
multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static
vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base.
Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly
available on https://huggingface.co/VaxGuide

TL;DR: 本文介绍了H2HTalk，这是一个评估大语言模型同伴在情感智能和语言流畅性上的基准，提供了4650种情景数据，并揭示了长时间规划和记忆保留的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字情感支持需求的增加，需要对大语言模型的情感共鸣能力进行评估，以开发更安全、情感支持更强的语言模型。

Method: H2HTalk基准包含4650个涵盖对话、回忆和行程计划的情景，开发了一个名为SAP的模块，基于依恋理论来提升安全性，并对50个大语言模型进行了统一的评估测试。

Result: 研究发现，尽管模型在情感智能和语言流畅性上有显著进步，但在长时间规划和应对用户隐性需求或对话变化时表现不足。

Conclusion: H2HTalk为构建情感智能与安全心理支持的语言模型提供了首个综合性基准，助力相关研究与开发。

Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions
offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation
lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a
benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic
interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk
features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary
planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding
previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment
Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer
interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that
long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models
struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent
companions. We release all materials to advance development of LLMs capable of
providing meaningful and safe psychological support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨舌癌手术后对发音清晰度（通过元音发音指数-VAI评估）和变异性（通过元音共振峰离散度-VFD测量）的影响，发现清晰度未显著下降但变异性有所增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 舌癌手术可能影响舌头的活动性及肌肉功能，从而对发音的清晰性和一致性造成影响，需进一步探索其具体变化。

Method: 通过句子朗读任务，比较11名舌癌患者术前术后6个月的发音数据，并与11名性别年龄匹配的正常讲话者对照，通过分析VAI和VFD评估发音清晰度和变异性。

Result: 术后VAI显著低于术前，但患者与正常讲话者的VAI均无显著差异；术后/i/的VFD显著高于术前及正常讲话者，表明变异性增加。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度总体保持在正常范围内，但发音变异性明显增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

*Nathaniel Berger,Johannes Eschbach-Dymanus,Miriam Exel,Matthias Huck,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于偏好优化的方法，利用术语修订数据改进神经机器翻译（NMT）系统的术语辨析能力，同时不依赖一对一的词典或在解码时需要人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际翻译场景中，术语通常具有多种有效翻译，正确性因上下文和企业风格指南而异，给NMT系统带来挑战。这促使作者研究如何利用大量的术语修订数据来提高术语翻译的准确性。

Method: 利用术语修订数据，结合监督微调和偏好优化方法，通过引入术语特定和全序列目标，改进术语辨析的能力，无需一对一的翻译词典或解码时的人工干预。

Result: 在英德翻译数据上的实验表明，该方法在术语准确性上显著优于现有强基线，同时不会显著降低COMET分数。此外，作者还发布了与术语相关的测试集。

Conclusion: 基于术语修订数据的偏好优化方法有效提高了NMT系统的术语翻译准确性，展示了无人工干预条件下的潜力，同时提供了公开数据测试集以供进一步研究。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

TL;DR: 论文比较了双曲空间与欧几里得空间在知识图谱多跳推理中的表现，结果显示双曲空间效果更好，尤其在层级结构明显的数据集中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多跳推理中，双曲空间与欧几里得空间在表达能力上的差异，明确它们各自的优劣。

Method: 采用一种简单的方法将双曲表示与编码器-解码器模型结合，进行受控实验，同时通过消融研究分析曲率初始值的影响。

Result: 双曲空间在多样化数据集上的性能持续优于欧几里得空间，且设置基于数据的曲率初值比随机初始化表现更佳。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在多跳推理中具有更强的优势，尤其在层级结构更明显的数据下，可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一个更新知识图谱(KG)的自动方法和数据集，结合维基百科文本和Wikidata的KG编辑操作进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的信息提取方法无法动态更新KG，本研究旨在解决如何基于文本变化动态调整知识图谱的问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含10个Wikidata快照和1.25M编辑操作的数据集，将它们与来自维基百科的376K文本段落配对，用于分析与更新KG。

Result: 实验结果显示基于新涌现文本知识来更新KG快照存在许多挑战，展示了数据集的研究价值。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型可以作为领域未来研究的基准，所有数据和实现将公开发布。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种低资源德语方言分类任务中的有效数据增强方法：基于检索的语音转换（RVC），并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言识别模型通常受到方言数据稀缺性的限制，作者旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 通过使用RVC方法，将音频样本转化为统一的目标说话人以减少与说话人相关的变化，并结合频率屏蔽和片段移除等其他增强方法提升分类性能。

Result: 实验表明，单独使用RVC即可提高分类性能，与其他增强方法结合使用效果更佳。

Conclusion: RVC方法在低资源方言情境下具有显著潜力，可改善方言分类的表现。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了对数据剪枝过程中的关键因素进行系统化分析的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 NLP 数据剪枝方法涉及多种设计选择，缺乏系统研究限制了进一步发展。

Method: 将数据剪枝分解为数据表示和选择算法两部分，并通过理论与实证分析探讨它们对实例选择的影响。

Result: 更好的数据表示（如训练梯度）通常对实例选择有积极影响，而不同选择算法在不同设置下表现各异，且并不总能实现其设计目标。

Conclusion: 选择算法的适用性需要具体问题具体分析，且对于数据剪枝的评估需更加审慎，数据表示的优化是提升性能的关键。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

TL;DR: TRACE是一种用于解释Transformer模型的模块化工具包，可在训练中进行轻量化的语言和表示信号分析，旨在提高解释性和诊断效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型训练过程中语言知识的产生时间和方式，克服现有工具后续性、复杂性和资源需求高的缺陷。

Method: 引入TRACE工具包，结合ABSynth合成语料生成器，实现包括特征探查、本征维度分析、Hessian曲率和输出诊断等语言学与表征信号轻量分析。

Result: TRACE揭示了语言模型中的发展现象，如早期句法出现、延迟语义获取和表征压缩，扩展了传统标量方法的不足，使诊断更具可操作性和可重复性。

Conclusion: TRACE工具加强了Transformer模型分析的易解释性和实用性，促进了模型的层级诊断、提前停止和结构性错误检测。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新数据集PFO用于评估语言模型的自动事实核查能力，并提出了新框架RAV以应对当前事实核查系统的挑战，其性能在多个基准测试中优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查数据集包含后期分析和注释提示，无法反映真实场景的即时验证需求，从而影响对语言模型的评估准确性。

Method: 提出了一个新的数据集PFO，去除后期分析和提示，并开发了RAV框架，利用问题生成、答案生成和标签生成三个模块，通过多轮问题回答逐步核查事实。

Result: 在多个基准上，RAV优于现有方法，例如在RAWFC (3类)上提升25.28%，在HOVER (2类)上在不同子分类中分别提升1.54%-4.94%。在PFO的测试中，RAV的性能下降相较基线最小，为16.3%。

Conclusion: 通过提升评价的真实性和开发改进的核查框架，该研究推进了自动化事实核查领域的发展，展示了RAV在跨域和不同标签粒度的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TACOS的新方法，通过整合开放标注与比较评分以改进指令微调数据选择，显著提升了数据选择效率与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据多样性与单样本质量评估方面存在不足，限制了指令微调的效果与效率。

Method: 利用大语言模型为人类查询分配开放标签，并通过归一化阶段对标签降噪以实现高效聚类；同时提出比较评分方法，在聚类中进行相对质量评估以避免传统单样本评估中的标准不一致问题。

Result: 在多数据集与多模型架构上，TACOS方法显著优于现有方法。在MT-Bench测试中表现出更好的指令遵循能力，并在AlpacaEval 2.0中于LLaMA2-7B-Based模型中获第一名。

Conclusion: TACOS方法有效解决了现有方法中的限制，通过更优的数据选择方式显著提升了大语言模型的指令微调表现。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中的表现验证了其克服领域局限性以及任务通用性的能力。

Conclusion: StructSense框架展示了在领域敏感性和任务通用性改善方面的潜力，具有广泛适用性，为科学发现和知识整合提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大规模推理模型擅长于System 2的慢速推理，但缺乏快速直觉式的System 1思维，导致计算开销大和响应延迟高。

Method: 通过识别用于慢速-快速思维切换的控制向量，并结合实时难度估计，提出一种基于表示编辑的测试时间缩放方法，实现不同复杂度的分段推理。

Result: 在无需训练或额外成本的情况下，方法实现了平均+1.3%的准确性提升，同时减少-8.6%的token使用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提高了大规模推理模型的效率与性能，还为广泛的应用和未来研究提供了支持和启发。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

### [317] [Alpay Algebra IV: Symbiotic Semantics and the Fixed-Point Convergence of Observer Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03774)
*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个理论框架，通过文档和AI模型的超限不动点交互实现稳定的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何实现AI模型与文本内容的稳定语义和意图理解对齐。

Method: 利用Alpay代数，引入函子系统，通过多个迭代转化和phi-infinity算子实现文本与AI的共同演化，达到唯一不动点。

Result: 证明了在AI嵌入空间中存在唯一的稳定点，该点语义一致，能够容忍扰动并保持稳定。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论方法，实现了AI嵌入层面的语义对齐，为语义安全、符号记忆和AI系统构建提供新的理论支持。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

### [318] [OrthoRank: Token Selection via Sink Token Orthogonality for Efficient LLM inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03865)
*Seungjun Shin,Jaehoon Oh,Dokwan Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型中的“吸收”token在深层中逐渐主导了其他token的隐藏状态，并提出了基于绕开“吸收”token的动态token选择方法OrthoRank。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型中吸收token的作用机制，改进token重要性判断方法以提高模型性能。

Method: 提出OrthoRank方法，通过检测token向“吸收”token靠近的速度，将重要性视为与吸收token的正交性，并对重要token进行选择。

Result: 实验显示OrthoRank方法在相同稀疏度下，比层裁剪方法在降低perplexity和提升zero-shot accuracy方面更优，同时在长文本任务(LongBench)中表现出色。

Conclusion: OrthoRank能更高效地筛选重要token，优化模型推理过程，同时取得更好的性能，展示了token重要性评估的新视角。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

Abstract: The introduction of ChatGPT has garnered significant attention within the NLP
community and beyond. Previous studies have demonstrated ChatGPT's substantial
advancements across various downstream NLP tasks, highlighting its adaptability
and potential to revolutionize language-related applications. However, its
capabilities and limitations in genre prediction remain unclear. This work
analyzes three Large Language Models (LLMs) using the MovieLens-100K dataset to
assess their genre prediction capabilities. Our findings show that ChatGPT,
without fine-tuning, outperformed other LLMs, and fine-tuned ChatGPT performed
best overall. We set up zero-shot and few-shot prompts using audio
transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset,
covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres.
Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize
a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This
fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In
conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction
capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further
enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related
applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.

Method: 设计了一个基于BERT的知识化检索器KPR，引入了上下文实体注意力层和可动态更新的实体嵌入，从而实现将外部实体知识集成到模型中，无需重新训练。

Result: KPR在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，其显著提升了检索精度，在EntityQuestions数据集上比未扩展版本模型提高了12.6%。在使用bge-base检索器的基础上，KPR在两个数据集中达到了同等规模模型的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入动态实体知识，KPR可以显著提升密集检索器在处理涉及实体的查询时的表现，同时提供了无需重新训练的灵活性。

Abstract: Dense retrievers often struggle with queries involving less-frequent entities
due to their limited entity knowledge. We propose the Knowledgeable Passage
Retriever (KPR), a BERT-based retriever enhanced with a context-entity
attention layer and dynamically updatable entity embeddings. This design
enables KPR to incorporate external entity knowledge without retraining.
Experiments on three datasets show that KPR consistently improves retrieval
accuracy, achieving a substantial 12.6% gain on the EntityQuestions dataset
over the model without KPR extensions. When built on the off-the-shelf bge-base
retriever, KPR achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized
models on two datasets. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: 这篇文章讨论了多语种大型语言模型（LLMs）对语言生态系统的影响，特别是模型坍塌可能导致语言多样性丧失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者希望揭示隐藏在现有技术发展的背后风险，即语言多样性的逐渐消失。

Method: 文章探讨了模型坍塌的概念，利用计算机视觉、自然语言处理和机器翻译领域的最新研究来说明这些模型如何导致语言的语言多样性和文化特色的丧失。

Result: 文章指出，多语言模型存在通过强化自身偏见逐渐抹去语言分布尾部现象的风险。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁重新构想自然语言处理领域，使其鼓励、重视并保护多语言的词汇和语言多样性，避免语言生态的单一化。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

incident reports. POSID combines lexical and semantic similarity techniques to
identify relevant sentences and extract attributes. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on a missing person use case using the InciText dataset,
achieving effective attribute extraction without supervised training.

Conclusion: Easy Dataset框架能够有效生成领域细化数据，验证了适应特定领域的大语言模型性能改进的可行性，其开源代码已获得显著的社区关注。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at
https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在多元文化环境中，LLMs的文化敏感性和推理能力，尤其关注韩国文化的表现。

Method: 开发了Nunchi-Bench基准，包含247个涵盖31个主题的问题，评估模型的事实知识、文化适当性建议以及情境解读能力，提出新的评估策略与定制评分标准。

Result: 发现LLMs在文化推理方面存在显著挑战。虽然模型能识别事实信息，但缺乏实际情境中的应用能力，同时明确的文化框架比单纯依赖语言提示更能提高表现。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench揭示了LLMs在文化推理领域的局限性，为提升其文化适应性提供了基础，且公开了基准和排行榜以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Method: 构建KOPL框架，将音素和词结合表示，用于韩语未登录词的表示，能够轻松与现有的静态和上下文嵌入模型集成。

Result: 实验结果表明，KOPL相比当前最佳表现的模型在多任务中平均提升了1.9%。

Conclusion: KOPL框架在处理韩语未登录词方面效果显著，可通用性强，有助于提升韩语NLP模型的整体性能。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce KOPL, a novel framework for handling Korean OOV
words with Phoneme representation Learning. Our work is based on the linguistic
property of Korean as a phonemic script, the high correlation between phonemes
and letters. KOPL incorporates phoneme and word representations for Korean OOV
words, facilitating Korean OOV word representations to capture both text and
phoneme information of words. We empirically demonstrate that KOPL
significantly improves the performance on Korean Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, while being readily integrated into existing static and contextual
Korean embedding models in a plug-and-play manner. Notably, we show that KOPL
outperforms the state-of-the-art model by an average of 1.9%. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传统RAG方法中，独立检索段落可能导致上下文冗余或信息不足，难以满足复杂问题需求，尤其是在噪声较大的语料库中或处理多跳问题时。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR)，通过将段落组合作为检索和重新排序的单元，显式建模段落间依赖关系，并采用上下文感知的查询重构和基于下游答案可能性对齐的重新排序步骤。

Result: 实验显示，在多个QA基准数据集中，AdaPCR在多跳逻辑推理任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: AdaPCR框架通过优化段落组合和依赖关系建模，显著提升了开放领域问答系统的检索能力和答案准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Abstract: Semantic map models represent meanings or functions as nodes in a graph
constrained by the local connectivity hypothesis, with edges indicating their
associations. Widely used in typological linguistics, these models compare
interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both
typologists and computational linguists. The system

### [330] [Conversation Forests: The Key to Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Turn Medical Conversations is Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04099)
*Thomas Savage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Savage Conversation Forests (SCF)的强化学习框架，用于解决多轮对话中的问题，尤其是在医学诊断场景中，SCF通过分支对话架构提高了诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的微调方法如DPO和GRPO，在单轮任务中表现出色，但在需要关注早期对话对后续影响的多轮应用中效果不足。特别是在医学中，多轮对话视角对诊断和互动动态理解至关重要。

Method: SCF利用强化学习和分支对话架构，在每一轮生成多种可能的对话延续，从而让模型学习早期回答对后续对话和诊断结果的影响。

Result: 在模拟的医患对话实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性对话架构。

Conclusion: SCF的改进在于多轮对话中提供更丰富、相互依赖的训练信号。这表明分支训练架构是微调LLMs处理复杂多轮对话任务的重要策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGQA因为输入图谱的结构和语义差异面临挑战，而现有的基于LLM的图谱遍历方法存在实体链接错误和对自定义KG泛化不足等问题。

Method: 提出了BYOKG-RAG框架，其中LLMs生成关键的图谱工件(如问题实体、候选答案等)，通过专业的图谱工具将其链接至KG并检索相关的图谱上下文，用以迭代优化图谱链接与检索，最终生成答案。

Result: 在五个不同KG类型的基准测试上，BYOKG-RAG较第二优方法提升了4.5个百分点，同时在自定义KG上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG通过结合LLMs和图检索工具，为解决KGQA任务提供了一种更通用且稳健的解决方案，并验证其有效性和优势。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然具备强大的生成能力，但容易出现幻觉（生成自信但事实性错误的内容）。研究旨在检测并分析这种现象。

Method: 利用多个随机生成中token的log概率差异，提出一种轻量、解释性强且无需真实参考的幻觉检测方法，并在三个不同规模的自回归模型上进行测试。

Result: 实验证明token级别的方差能够可靠地指示输出不稳定性，并与幻觉模式相关，同时通过可视化诊断进一步验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

*Mael Jullien,Marco Valentino,Leonardo Ranaldi,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了提示策略与高效微调技术对临床自然语言推理的影响，发现提示结构对性能的影响显著，LoRA微调提升了模型表现，并表明紧凑的模型可通过提示设计竞争大规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理能力方面表现出色，但在临床自然语言推理领域的应用仍较少探索，本文试图系统评估提示结构与效率微调如何形成模型性能。

Method: 本文构建了四类提示策略，用于激发模型在抽象层次上的推理能力，并结合高质量案例通过LoRA微调的方法，将多步推理能力蒸馏到较小规模的模型中。此外，通过NLI4CT、MedNLI及TREC Clinical Trials Track基准进行性能比较分析。

Result: 实验表明，提示类型能解释高达44%的性能方差，LoRA微调进一步提升了8-12 F1，同时提高了输出对齐度至97%以上。经过优化的紧凑模型与更大模型表现差距缩小至7.1%以内。

Conclusion: (i) 提示结构是临床推理性能的主要驱动因素；(ii) 配备强提示与LoRA的紧凑模型可媲美前沿大规模系统；(iii) 基于推理类型的评估对于揭示提示所带来的权衡至关重要。这为提示设计与轻量化适配在专门领域的高效应用提供启发。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

TL;DR: 提出一种称为Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT)的新框架，结合对抗数据增强及文化知识图谱整合，大幅提升零样本多文化名字识别能力，刷新准确率表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球化背景下多文化名字识别需求增加，传统方法在处理未遇见名字或复杂语言文化背景时表现欠佳，急需新的解决方案。

Method: 采用Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT)框架，通过大语言模型精准提示工程、文化知识图谱动态整合及对抗数据增强等方法，将名字识别转化为指导生成任务。

Result: 相比于基线深度学习模型（如包含文化标记的Bi-LSTM），PEFT框架在总体识别准确率达到93.1%，零样本名字识别准确率达到89.5%。

Conclusion: 本研究显著提升了多文化名字识别能力，提供了一种高效且可拓展的实际解决方案，对相关领域有重大意义。

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动注释角色关系耗时且覆盖率低，而大型语言模型生成的内容常出现幻觉或逻辑不一致问题，因此有必要开发更高效、更准确的方法。

Method: 提出SymbolicThought框架，结合LLM提取与符号推理，通过人机交互构建和优化角色关系图，并利用七种逻辑约束提高准确性。同时，发布了包含160个人际关系和相应逻辑结构的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，SymbolicThought在提高注释准确性、一致性及显著降低时间成本方面具有优势，为叙事理解和AI应用提供了有效工具。

Conclusion: SymbolicThought框架通过逻辑约束、人机交互机制，不仅提升了关系注释质量，还支持解释性分析及LLM评估，为复杂叙事理解和社会化AI研究作出贡献。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context Tuning的新方法，在无需调整模型参数的情况下，大幅提升了语言模型的少样本适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前提示词适应技术往往初始化与特定任务无关的提示词或前缀，缺乏针对性。

Method: Context Tuning利用任务相关的示例初始化可训练提示词或前缀，利用模型的内在上下文学习能力提高少样本学习表现。

Result: 在CrossFit、UnifiedQA、MMLU等基准上，Context Tuning表现优于传统提示词方法，并以更高的训练效率达到与测试时训练相当的准确度。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且有效的少样本适应方法，展示了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)在图书馆虚拟参考服务中的公平性问题，发现大多数模型对种族、性别和社会角色采取了相对公平的回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是评估LLMs在服务不同用户时是否会因用户的性别、种族/民族或机构角色而产生区别性反应，以此分析LLMs在图书馆服务中的公平性表现。

Method: 通过提示六个最先进的LLMs对不同身份的用户（性别、种族/民族和机构角色）提供支持，分析其反应是否存在差别。

Result: 研究未发现LLMs在种族或民族上的反应差异，仅在一个模型中发现对女性的轻微刻板偏见。模型对不同机构角色的用户表现出基于语言选择的适应性，这与专业标准相关，而非歧视性对待。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实现公平和情境适当的沟通方面表现出了一定的可行性，有潜力为学术图书馆提供更加公平的虚拟参考服务。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Motivation: 目前自然语言处理领域对高质量数据集的需求日益增加，但针对东亚语言的数据资源和相关分析仍存在明显不足，需填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 通过定量与定性结合的方法，分析了在 HuggingFace 平台上的 3300 多个数据集，揭示了中文、日文、韩文 NLP 社区数据集创建与整理的特点。

Result: 发现中文数据主要由机构主导，韩文社区以草根开发为主，而日文数据集则侧重于娱乐和亚文化。

Conclusion: 通过改进数据集文档化、明确授权及加强跨语言资源共享，可促进更具文化适应性的 LLM 开发，并提出了未来数据集协作与策划的最佳实践。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

Method: 通过研究国家法规、社交媒体政策和NLP数据集，分析仇恨言论的定义及其审查策略的异同。

Result: 发现各法律、平台政策和研究之间存在显著差异，缺乏统一的定义和一致性。

Conclusion: 根据研究洞察，提出可以探索建立综合多种策略的自动仇恨言论审查框架。

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种大型语言模型（GPT、Gemini和LLAMA）在检测关于HPV疫苗和加热烟草产品的健康情绪（支持或风险）方面的准确性，发现它们总体表现良好，但存在平台、健康话题和模型类型上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习技术广泛应用于分析健康相关公众话题，本研究旨在揭示LLMs在检测健康观点准确性上的效果，填补这一技术研究上的空白。

Method: 研究利用Facebook和Twitter的数据，结合人类注释作为情绪分类的金标准，评估GPT、Gemini和LLAMA对健康相关情绪的检测能力。

Result: 三种LLMs在区分风险和支持情绪方面表现出较高准确性，然而在平台（如Facebook、Twitter）、健康议题及模型类型间存在准确性差异。尤其是，风险情绪在Facebook上准确性较高，而支持情绪在Twitter上检测更佳。同时，LLMs对中立情绪的检测表现出一定的挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在公共卫生分析中选择和验证合适的语言模型至关重要，因为数据中的潜在偏差可能导致情绪真实比例的高估或低估。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Motivation: 探索数学问题解决训练方法对其他推理能力的泛化潜力及其最有效的训练方式。

Method: 通过对数学文本的持续训练、指令微调和基于规则的强化学习，评估短链和长链式推理样本在5个数学和8个一般推理基准上的泛化表现。

Conclusion: 长链式推理链结合自我反思，为通过专门领域学习改进通用推理能力提供了一个有潜力的方向。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于宗教和精神（R/S）概念的复杂性和领域依赖性，很难对其进行常规的档案搜索，尤其是在数据量大、获取困难以及信息噪音大的情况下，研究人员需要大量的时间和专门知识，这限制了有效的信息提取及利用。

Method: 提出了基于检索增强生成（RAG）的系统SpiritRAG。该系统使用了7500个与健康和教育领域R/S相关的联合国决议文件，提供了一个基于聊天的网络界面，允许用户进行复杂且情境敏感的数据库搜索。

Result: 通过对100个手动编写问题的试点测试及领域专家的评估，验证了SpiritRAG的实用价值和可用性。

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为研究人员和政策制定者提供了一种轻量化、易访问的工具，可以高效处理与宗教和精神相关的复杂数据查询，从而节省时间并提高分析效率。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\rat的混合机制，通过在块内使用局部递归和块间使用softmax注意力，灵活平衡RNN和注意力的优缺点，显著提高训练和生成速度，同时保持或改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长上下文处理中，由于softmax注意力所导致的计算瓶颈问题，尤其是在长序列场景下的低效性。

Method: 将输入划分为块，在块内运用线性递归捕获局部依赖，块间使用softmax注意力建模长距离交互。通过调整块大小，实现在性能与效率之间的灵活权衡。同时提出结合\rat与局部注意力的混合架构用于强化长短距离建模。

Result: 在模型规模达1.3B参数的实验中，\rat在100K和4K序列训练速度上分别提升7倍与9倍，同时在短长序列任务和监督微调中性能表现出色。通过混合架构进一步提高了推理速度、减少缓存内存并改善任务表现。

Conclusion: \rat机制显著优化了长序列建模的效率和性能，并通过与局部注意力的结合实现了稳定的性能提升，适用于各种任务场景，展示了较高的实用潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型传统的集中式微调在处理特定领域任务时存在隐私风险，亟需新的解决方案。

Method: 论文通过优化视角分析离线微调问题，提出了使用梯度保留的压缩方法（如秩压缩和通道剪枝）来实现离线微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和模型性能方面优于现有的离线微调方法。

Conclusion: GradOT为离线微调提供了理论基础，且是一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MiDRE模型，通过整合内部和外部推理专家，改进多模态讽刺检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态讽刺检测模型不足以捕捉讽刺背后的深层原因，主要依赖表面线索，缺乏对文化背景或常识推理能力的利用。

Method: 提出MiDRE模型，包括内部推理专家（检测图文对中的不一致）和外部推理专家（通过大规模视觉语言模型的链式推理生成结构化推理）。通过自适应门控机制动态加权两个专家。

Result: MiDRE在两组基准数据集上的性能优于各类基线模型。

Conclusion: 外部推理即使有时带来噪声，也能为模型提供有价值的指导，有助于更深入理解讽刺，为多模态讽刺检测提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了用于多模态讽刺检测的DMDP框架，其在少样本和低资源场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型需要大量标注数据，在真实场景中的实用性较低，需要探索讽刺检测的少样本解决方案。

Method: 引入了一种名为DMDP的深度模态解耦提示调优框架，利用分层特征学习和模态特定的深度提示，提高文本与视觉模态的讽刺检测能力。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上，DMDP在少样本和极低资源场景下均表现出色，跨数据集评估中也优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DMDP是一种针对少样本多模态讽刺检测的有效方法，具有良好的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 探索扩散语言模型（dLLMs）的理论优势，同时解决其在可控生成方面的挑战。

Method: 提出“S3”框架，通过将目标模式结构注入输出上下文来改进扩散语言模型的生成过程，减少计算开销并提高生成的可控性。

Result: 相比基准模型，“S3”框架提升了结构符合度65%、内容保真度48%，并减少了幻觉率17%。

Conclusion: 研究既提供了理论基础，也探索了扩散模型在可控文本生成任务中的实际应用路径，预示其潜在价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdS（Adapter-State Sharing）框架，专注于在资源有限的情况下实现图文讽刺检测任务，效果显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社交媒体中图文讽刺检测由于资源限制而低效的问题，提升低资源场景中的性能。

Method: 引入基于CLIP的轻量框架AdS，通过在上层插入适配器并且引入独特的适配器状态共享机制，由文本适配器指导视觉适配器，实现高效的跨模态学习。

Result: 在两项公开基准测试中，AdS使用显著更少的可训练参数达到了最新技术水平。

Conclusion: AdS框架在保持低层单模态表示的同时，提升了跨模态学习效率，是一种适用于讽刺检测任务的高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

TL;DR: 提出DP-Fusion机制，利用差分隐私技術避免大型语言模型在生成内容时意外泄露敏感信息，并在隐私保护与文本质量之间提供权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有隐私保护方法中缺乏正式保证或隐私效用平衡差的问题，保障大型语言模型在生成内容时对敏感信息的隐私保护能力。

Method: 提出DP-Fusion机制，通过差分隐私推理，在文档敏感数据的保护中，使用分组方式对敏感内容进行处理，并将每组的结果融合，控制生成输出的隐私与效用平衡。

Result: 通过实验验证，DP-Fusion在文本隐私保护与文本效用之间实现了较好的平衡，可根据参数调整隐私保护力度。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion提供了一种在复杂任务中实现细粒度隐私/效用权衡的方法，同时确保生成内容的隐私保护与实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Motivation: 开发能够高效理解和生成阿拉伯语及拉丁脚本文本的LLM，填补当前LLM开发中对双脚本语言的忽视。

Method: 通过Branch-Train-MiX策略将脚本特化专家模型合并为单个MoE模型，并引入新的埃及方言评估基准测试。

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及方言的理解和生成任务上优于现有领先模型，其中12B模型在拉丁脚本基准测试上较Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct提升14.4%。

Conclusion: Nile-Chat系列提供了一种全面的方法来适配双脚本语言模型，并为这一领域探索提供了公开资源。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化方法多，但缺乏统一理论框架，无法系统理解个性化的关键因素。

Method: 引入双重记忆模型，并结合情节记忆（历史交互）和语义记忆（长期信念）构建PRIME框架。同时加入慢思策略的个性化能力。

Result: PRIME在长短情境下均表现出卓越效果，能够超越流行性偏好实现动态个性化。

Conclusion: PRIME整合记忆机制和个性化思维，在实现高效个性化的同时填补了理论与评测基准的空白。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

*Matteo Guida,Yulia Otmakhova,Eduard Hovy,Lea Frermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，用于分析新闻文章的措辞（framing）与读者评论之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会科学研究表明，读者会主动重新组织新闻中的措辞，但在自然语言处理中，这种关系常被忽略。

Method: 设计了一个计算框架，能基于句子级别的预测重建文章和评论中的主要措辞，并对文章与相关评论进行匹配分析。

Result: 在11个话题和两个新闻媒体的实验中发现，不同媒体读者评论中的措辞重复使用有高度相关性，但具体模式因话题而异。

Conclusion: 通过释放分类器和数据集，促进了解新闻措辞与受众反应之间的关系。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关系抽取方法在领域外（OOD）泛化表现较差，作者希望通过调整方法提升此任务的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种名为R1-RE的框架，基于强化学习结合可验证奖励（RLVR），利用小型语言模型的推理能力，以模拟人类注释流程优化关系抽取任务。

Result: R1-RE-7B模型在多个数据集上的领域外精度达到了约70%，与主流专有模型（如GPT-4）的表现相当。

Conclusion: 新方法显著改善了关系抽取任务的领域外鲁棒性，并揭示了RLVR范式在训练动力学和推理行为上的新见解。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Motivation: 现有研究未探讨情感检测和解释性范围识别在电子商务评论中的联合任务，无法深入理解引发客户情感反应的触发点。

Method: 提出EOT联合任务，基于Plutchik的8大主要情绪理论建模情感类别与触发文本的关系；构建EOT-X数据集；开发EOT-DETECT框架进行评估。

Result: EOT-DETECT框架在多个电子商务领域超越了零样本和链式思维技术，表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文提出并验证了一种创新方式，揭示电子商务评论中情感和触发因素的相互关系，为探索客户情感反应提供新的视角。

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across
e-commerce domains.

Conclusion: LOOM-Scope有效解决了现有评估中标准化不足和高成本的问题，为社区提供了高效长上下文模型评估工具。

Abstract: Long-context processing has become a fundamental capability for large

long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

*Martijn Bentum,Louis ten Bosch,Tomas O. Lentz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探究了自监督语音模型（S3M）学习的单词重音表示，重点分析了Wav2vec 2.0模型在五种语言中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单词重音在多语言环境中的表现，并探究这些表示是否具有语言特定性。

Method: 使用诊断分类器对自监督模型的嵌入进行训练，测试区分处于朗读句子中的重音和非重音音节的能力，并分析来自不同语言中的表现差异。

Result: 分类器可以高精度区分重音与非重音音节，并发现这些重音表示是语言特定的，特别是在自由重音与固定重音语言之间表现差异更大。

Conclusion: S3M模型能够识别单词重音，且其重音表示具有语言特定性，对语言间重音规律研究有参考价值。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

### [363] [A Tale of Two Scripts: Transliteration and Post-Correction for Judeo-Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04746)
*Juan Moreno Gonzalez,Bashar Alhafni,Nizar Habash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个两步法，实现犹太-阿拉伯语（Judeo-Arabic）到阿拉伯语的自动音译，同时提供首个针对该任务的大语言模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于犹太-阿拉伯语中存在模糊字母映射、不一致的正字法规则以及频繁的代码切换，使其自动音译为阿拉伯语极具挑战性。

Method: 采用两步法：先进行简单的字符级映射，然后通过后期修正处理语法和正字法错误。

Result: 验证了音译技术的可行性，并首次针对音译任务对大语言模型进行了基准评估。研究表明音译可以辅助现有的阿拉伯语NLP工具实现语法标注及机器翻译。

Conclusion: 成功证明了提出方法的有效性，音译不仅可还原犹太-阿拉伯文本，还扩展了阿拉伯语自然语言处理任务的应用范围。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究旨在将产品元数据与评价总结相结合，提出了M-OS-EVAL数据集评价方法，并验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传统的评价总结中，未能有效结合产品描述、规格等元数据，限制了总结的全面性和实用性。

Method: 提出了一种多来源意见总结方法(M-OS)，并开发了一个新的评价数据集M-OS-EVAL，用于测评7个关键维度的总结质量。

Result: 通过用户研究表明，87%的用户更喜欢M-OS生成的总结，其生成的总结在与人类判断的一致性上表现更佳，Spearman相关系数达到0.74。

Conclusion: 多来源意见总结方法能显著提升用户参与度和总结质量，这种方法优于传统总结方法。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoSteer的新框架，通过本地化的动态调整实现解码阶段的个性化文本生成，并保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对语言模型在云端性能和本地化隐私保护之间的性能权衡，满足即时自定义生成需求。

Method: 使用本地小模型生成的差异信息作为调控信号，在云端LLM解码时动态调整输出，同时只传输最终生成结果，保障隐私。

Result: 在不同个性化生成任务的实验中，CoSteer通过本地用户信息显著提高了生成效果，同时保持较低的设备计算开销和隐私保护。

Conclusion: CoSteer框架成功实现了隐私友好的高效个性化文本生成，同时提升了模型的解码性能与用户适配能力。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型如何记忆标签噪声，以及这种记忆为何通常不会对模型的推理能力产生重大影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型是如何处理标签噪声的，同时探究为什么这种记忆不损害模型在推理任务中的一般化能力。

Method: 使用了两种可控的合成推理数据集，即四位数加法(FDA)和两跳关系推理(THR)，研究模型对噪声标签的记忆及其背后的机制。

Result: 发现记忆依赖于可推广的推理机制，记忆通过分布式编码运作，并通过研究验证记忆是通过异常值启发式实现的。

Conclusion: 标签噪声的记忆建立在基础推理机制的基础上，而不是取代了推理机制。这为理解“善意记忆”现象提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to
produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and
contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and
entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has
received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is
currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area.
To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun
generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional
approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models.
Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research
challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上，Spec-TOD表现出与现有系统的竞争力，并大幅减少对标注数据的需求。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD证明了在低资源环境下建立高效任务型对话系统的可行性，潜在推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Result: 实验结果显示，所提方法在多个评估指标上均优于传统基线，并能够有效实现小说中角色关系网络的自动化构建。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了在复杂上下文中提取角色关系的性能，并为此领域研究提供了高质量的中文小说关系抽取数据集支持。

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

(sector-specific knowledge) and $\textit{SyntheticQA}$ (for RAG evaluation),
along with $\textit{NyayChat}$, a dataset of 300 annotated chatbot
conversations. We also introduce $\textit{Judgments}$ data sourced from Indian
Consumer Courts to aid the chatbot in decision making and to enhance user
trust. We also propose $\textbf{HAB}$ metrics ($\textbf{Helpfulness, Accuracy,
Brevity}$) to evaluate chatbot performance. Legal domain experts validated
Grahak-Nyay's effectiveness. Code and datasets will be released.

<details>

Motivation: 在对话中，回答需要既了解对话历史又基于检索的文档支撑，但域特定OR-CONVQA数据集获取困难。

Method: 利用组织的纯文本文件，通过生成对话及相关注解训练问答重写器，使其能去上下文化地重写用户问题。

Result: 通过训练问答重写器，能使现有的非对话型检索器结合去上下文问题和检索信息并生成回答。

Conclusion: 自动生成的对话数据和方法提升了OR-CONVQA系统的训练效果及实用性。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中语义表示的位置，以提升其可解释性和促进行业架构创新。

Method: 通过固定的、非语义的视觉嵌入向量替代传统的可训练输入嵌入层训练Transformer模型，并开发Unicode为核心的分词器保障文本覆盖面。

Result: 实验表明，采用非语义视觉嵌入的模型在生成有意义文本及推理能力测试上优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 语义特性并非嵌入层的固有属性，而是Transformer结构和数据规模的组合效果，嵌入层可重新定义为结构性而非语义性角色。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Motivation: 当前缺乏能够全面评估视觉代码生成的基准，这影响了用于动态和交互式视觉生成模型的发展。

Method: 提出ArtifactsBench框架，通过程序化渲染生成的工件并捕捉其动态行为，再由多模态语言模型（MLLM）通过细化的任务清单进行评估。

Result: ArtifactsBench在评估中展现了94.4%的排名一致性和超过90%的专家配对一致性，表明其可靠性。

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench为评估生成模型的用户感知质量提供了可扩展且准确的工具，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Result: 用户研究、质性和量化分析证实了框架的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models
(LLMs). Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset
provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and
quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多自然语言处理技术在处理文本相似性任务时缺乏可解释性，且难以准确区分逻辑蕴含、不相关和矛盾关系。

Method: 结合图和逻辑生成第一阶逻辑表示，通过Montague语法生成机器和人类可读的表示，并测试了三种数据集来验证方法性能。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法在捕捉文本结构等逻辑特性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为从大规模文本数据中更透明和可靠的信息检索迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Conclusion: 研究表明，合理的策略和设计能够显著改善LLMs的摘要效果，为高效和基于指令的NLP系统研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出SMART方法，通过对齐模拟学生能力，预测开放性问题的难度，解决了以往方法中的成本高和冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育评估中问题难度的准确估计至关重要。然而传统方法依赖学生真实回答，耗时耗力，并且无法适用于冷启动场景。

Method: 提出一种新的方法SMART，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）对模拟学生进行能力对齐，生成模拟响应后结合大语言模型进行评分，并使用IRT模型估算问题难度。

Result: 通过实验验证，SMART方法在真实世界数据集上的表现优于其他预测方法，尤其是在能力对齐方面有显著改善。

Conclusion: SMART提供了一种高效且适用于冷启动的教育评估中问题难度预测的新途径。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Motivation: 学习日语词汇因其不同的书写系统和复杂的汉字，对于罗马字母背景的学习者来说是一个挑战。

Method: 采用生成性框架，通过一个新颖的期望最大化算法学习日语助记助记符的潜在结构和组合规则，并基于学习者创作的助记数据进行训练。

Result: 新方法不仅在面向新学习者时表现较好，还能够提供有效助记创造背后的机制洞察。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够以系统化和可解释的方式构建助记符号，为日语学习提供帮助，特别是在汉字学习方面。

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成文本的检测难题，提出通过对特定模型进行微调来区分人类和机器生成的文本，并识别生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的文本越来越逼真，导致如钓鱼邮件、虚假新闻等滥用现象增多，如何有效区分人类和机器生成的文本成为关键问题。

Method: 通过对GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT模型进行微调，分别解决区分人类与机器生成文本（任务A）以及识别生成模型（任务B）的任务。

Result: 微调后的GPT_4o-mini和BERT模型，在任务A上达到了0.9547的准确率，在任务B上为0.4698。

Conclusion: 尽管在区分人类与机器生成文本上取得了高准确率，但识别具体生成模型的能力仍有待提升，未来需进一步改进检测方法和模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的语言模型后训练方法，通过在FFN层上进行内存向量利用的指导，提升了多种任务的性能和模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调等后训练方法未能有效利用预训练阶段获取的知识，需要一种方法促进语言模型中参数化信息的利用。

Method: 将FFN层视为关联的键值存储内存，通过前向传播干预或反向传播中的正则化，促进内存向量的使用。

Result: 所提方法在Qwen、Gemma、Llama等模型家族中表现出一致的性能提升，包括15项不同任务的ID和OOD评估，同时增强模型在生成语义上更有意义的词元时的适应性。

Conclusion: 传统后训练方法未充分挖掘预训练的潜力，而在隐表示空间中引导语言模型是一种提升性能和可解释性的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: OpenS2S促进了研究者对情感语音系统的探索，为情感化人机交互领域的创新和透明性贡献了重要力量。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决印地语等低资源语言中缺乏自动化工具进行虚假信息检测的问题，并生成符合人类推理的可靠新闻解释。

Method: 通过将直接偏好优化与课程学习相结合，引入'真实性(Actuality)'和'雅致性(Finesse)'两个参数优化损失函数，并使用LLMs和PLMs进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明该框架能够生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 此框架具有可扩展性，可用于打击虚假信息并推广至其他低资源语言中的自动化解释生成。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的奖励建模方法——POLAR，通过区分策略差异生成奖励信号。实验表明，POLAR能够显著提升奖励模型表现并具有良好的推广能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改进奖励建模的效率和效果，提出POLAR作为一种基于策略差异的奖励信号生成方法，以代替传统的绝对偏好方法。

Method: 提出了POLAR方法，通过训练奖励模型识别相同和区分不同的策略，捕捉策略之间的相对差异，并用作构建通用排序关系的优化目标。

Result: POLAR在多个评测任务中相比于现有方法显著提升了表现。例如，POLAR-7B在STEM任务上的偏好准确率从54.8%提升到81.0%，在创意写作任务上从57.9%提升到85.5%。此外，POLAR在RLHF中表现出了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR展示了惊人的性能、强大的泛化能力和良好的扩展性，是发展通用且强大的奖励模型的一个有前途的方向。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中的上下文启动脆弱性，为其发现和应对新的安全问题。

Method: 提出了Response Attack，通过辅助LLM生成温和有害的回应并结合触发提示，利用上下文启动机制发动攻击。此外，开发了一个上下文感知安全微调数据集以降低攻击成功率。

Result: 在测试的八种开放源代码和专有LLM中，Response Attack的攻击成功率超过了七种最先进的技术方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著暴露了LLM中的安全隐患，同时通过构建安全微调数据集展现了解决该问题的潜力。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要集中于推理、规划和执行能力，而对记忆代理的研究不足，缺乏评价其记忆机制能力的基准。

Method: 设计了一个新的基准MemoryAgentBench，通过重新构建和设计数据集，全面测试记忆代理的四项核心能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有记忆机制无法完全达到四项能力要求，显示出研究记忆机制的重要性和方法上的不足。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench弥补了记忆代理基准的空白，为未来探索更完善的记忆机制提供了参考。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial

Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We

*Congmin Min,Rhea Mathew,Joyce Pan,Sahil Bansal,Abbas Keshavarzi,Amar Viswanathan Kannan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展且经济高效的框架，在企业环境中部署基于图的检索增强生成（GraphRAG）。通过消除对大型语言模型（LLMs）的依赖，并优化图检索策略，解决了构建知识图谱的高计算成本及图检索的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG在多跳推理和结构化检索方面有潜力，但因知识图谱构建计算开销大及检索延迟高而限制了其使用，论文作者试图通过创新技术解决这些限制。

Method: 引入了两项核心创新：1）基于依存解析的知识图谱构建管道，利用工业级NLP库进行实体和关系的提取，完全消除对LLMs的依赖；2）结合混合查询节点识别与高召回低延迟的一跳遍历的轻量图检索策略。

Result: 在针对SAP遗留代码迁移的两个数据集上测试，系统在LLM-as-Judge与RAGAS指标上分别提升达15%和4.35%。基于依存的构建方法与LLM生成的知识图谱性能相近（61.87%对65.83%），同时极大降低了成本并提升了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 验证了在真实企业环境中，不需高昂资源即可实用化、可解释且适应领域的检索增强推理系统的可行性，推动了GraphRAG的实际应用可能性。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了CodeAgents，一种在多智能体系统中进行多智能体推理并高效规划的框架，提升了任务成功率并减少了令牌使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进提示设计，解决现有方法在多智能体环境中的效率、模块化和可扩展性问题，推动大语言模型在复杂场景下的应用。

Method: 使用多模块伪代码（包括循环、条件语句及变量类型等）来结构化多智能体交互，如任务、计划、反馈等，使其可解释性和验证性更强，同时减少令牌消耗。

Result: 在GAIA、HotpotQA和VirtualHome三个基准中，相较于自然语言提示基线，计划性能提高了3-36个百分点。在VirtualHome中取得新记录：成功率达56%，同时输入输出令牌用量分别减少55-87%和41-70%。

Conclusion: CodeAgents显著提升了多智能体场景下的任务成功率，并有效减少令牌使用，展示出在可扩展、多智能体大语言模型系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了生成动态文本属性图（DyTAG）的基准GDGB，包括八个高质量数据集，设计了两种生成任务（TDGG和IDGG），并创建了新的评估指标和生成框架GAG-General。实验验证了方法的有效性，奠定了DyTAG生成领域基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DyTAG数据集文本质量低，未能很好支持生成任务，同时缺乏泛化的任务定义和评估协议。

Method: 提出GDGB基准数据集，定义了两种新任务TDGG和IDGG，设计多维评价指标，并开发了新型生成框架GAG-General。

Result: 实验表明，GDGB可以支持严谨的DyTAG生成任务评估，揭示了结构与文本特性的关键交互。

Conclusion: GDGB为DyTAG生成研究提供了重要的基础资源，有助于进一步实际应用和研究进展。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Memory Mosaics的扩展性能，将其扩展到10B规模（对应大语言模型）并在实际数据集上进行训练，发现其在新知识存储和上下文学习方面比Transformer表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察Memory Mosaics在扩展至大模型规模及真实数据集场景下，是否仍具备其在中等规模模型与小型合成数据集上的优势。

Method: 通过将Memory Mosaics扩展到10B参数规模，使用一万亿标记进行训练，并提出Memory Mosaics v2结构改进，评估其在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度的能力表现。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识存储方面与Transformer相当，但在推理阶段的新任务处理能力上显著优于Transformer，并且即使将Transformer训练数据量增加到八万亿标记，也无法复制这些改进。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics 通过架构调整和扩展，在新知识存储和任务泛化能力方面展现出优越性，为大规模语言模型的设计提供新的可能性。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，利用线性时序逻辑（LTL）实现LLM的长期高效与安全规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM在长期规划任务中容易累积错误，导致行为不安全或低效，限制了其通用场景的应用。

Method: 通过一个LLM actor与基于LTL的LLM critic（LTLCrit）的互动，结合自然语言观测与形式逻辑分析，动态生成安全约束以提高长期规划的高效性和安全性。

Result: 在Minecraft的钻石挖掘任务中，实验达到了100%的任务完成率，并显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: LLMs通过逻辑相互监督是一种强大且灵活的通用决策范式，有助于提升安全性与适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector
embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our
methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured

optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

Motivation: 探索如何通过对象状态的识别和上下文感知，为视障人士解决烹饪中的进度跟踪和反馈问题。

Method: 提出OSCAR管道，该管道整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、步骤的视觉对齐，以及时间因果建模，用于支持实时的步骤跟踪。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了一种上下文感知的食谱进度跟踪技术管道、注释数据集以及设计见解，为开发未来的助残烹饪系统提供指导。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在调用企业API时，面对类似工具冲突和参数不足问题时表现不佳，因此需要更可靠的方法来支持实际应用。

Method: 提出DiaFORGE框架，包括三阶段流程：1）生成多轮模仿用户意图的对话，2）利用推理记录对大规模开源模型进行微调，3）通过动态评估套件进行实用性测试，并结合动态与静态指标评估性能。

Result: 利用DiaFORGE训练的模型在动态评估DiaBENCH中，将工具调用成功率提高了27个百分点（相较于GPT-4o）和49个百分点（相较于Claude-3.5-Sonnet）。

Conclusion: DiaFORGE能够显著改进LLMs在工具调用方面的实际表现，提供了一个有效的开放资源，促进了构建企业级工具调用代理的研究进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为iSelf-Discover的新框架，用于比较动态生成的结构化JSON推理和非结构化推理，并在多个基准测试上显示非结构化推理具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂系统中与LLM整合时，尽管结构化输出对增强推理的可预测性有帮助，但它可能牺牲性能，因此需要探索两种方式的优劣水平。

Method: 提出iSelf-Discover框架，结合动态生成的结构化JSON推理和非结构化推理，并通过综合性基准测试评估其性能差异。

Result: 非结构化推理在多个基准测试中表现出一致优势，特别是在复杂的MATH基准上，非结构化推理的性能比结构化方法提高了18.90%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在某些复杂问题中，过分依赖结构化格式可能不是最佳选择，并需要重新评估如何优化复杂系统的组织形式。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Method: 作者对比了当前关于AI策划能力的研究实践与20世纪70年代关于非人类灵长类动物是否掌握自然语言的研究方法，分析历史经验教训并提出改进建议。

Result: 研究发现，过去的类似研究中存在如将人类特质过度归因于非人类、过度依赖轶事分析、理论框架不明确等问题。

Conclusion: 作者建议在当前AI策划能力研究中主动避免上述问题，并提出具体步骤以推动研究的科学性和严谨性。

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法可能忽视影像表型与其它多模态数据之间的复杂非线性关系，因此需要一个更全面且自动化的关联分析方法。

Method: 提出一个多代理框架MESHAgents，结合心血管影像，通过AI代理团队（涵盖心脏病学、生物力学、统计学和临床研究等领域）进行自组织迭代推理，动态生成共识和统计关联。

Result: MESHAgents能自主发现影像表型与非影像因素间的关联，包括传统因子以外的新的混杂变量。在疾病分类任务中，其发现的表型性能与专家级相当（AUC差异仅-0.004），并在6种疾病的识别中提升召回率。

Conclusion: MESHAgents框架以透明和可扩展的方式提供了临床相关影像表型，为专家驱动方法提供了可行且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图表示与强化学习的新方法，用于解决状态和行动空间无限的动态任务分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态任务分配问题需要处理具有无限状态和行动空间的复杂情况，而现有的深度强化学习方法在任务特征和资源特征表示上面临挑战。

Method: 提出了任务分配问题的图表示方法（assignment graph），将标记彩色Petri网映射为图，并适配了近端策略优化算法用于学习任务分配策略。

Result: 通过对三种不同状态和行动空间维度的问题进行建模，实验表明该方法在复杂分配场景下表现优异，并能近似最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了状态和行动空间无限情况下的任务分配问题，为类似问题的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了生成式AI在未来无线网络中的应用，专注于通过ORAN架构生成xApps和rApps任务。其核心关注点是通过不同的RAG方法进行模型优化，并进行性能对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于ORAN架构开发的无线网络中优化生成式AI，以应对普通LLM无法适配的电信领域需求，同时减少微调基础模型的高昂成本。

Method: 比较评估了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG方法，通过ORAN规格进行测试，采用综合性评价指标对生成性能进行对比分析。

Result: 研究发现，相比传统的Vector RAG方法，GraphRAG提升了7%的上下文相关性，Hybrid GraphRAG则提升了8%的事实正确性。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG均优于传统RAG方法，尤其在重要指标如事实正确性和上下文相关性方面表现更佳，为无线网络智能应用开发提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Motivation: 旨在解决多代理系统需要手动配置工作流，缺乏动态演化和性能优化支持的问题。

Method: 采用五层模块化架构，集成TextGrad、AFlow和MIPRO三种优化算法，在演化层进行优化。

Result: 在HotPotQA、MBPP、MATH和GAIA上取得显著性能提升，如HotPotQA F1提高7.44%、MBPP通过率@1提高10%、MATH解决准确率提升10%、GAIA整体准确率最大提升20%。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

Motivation: 现有的贝叶斯逆向规划模型在处理大量假设和动作的场景时受到限制，而LLMs在某些推理任务上表现出色但存在稳定性问题。

Method: 将LLMs用于生成假设和似然函数，并与贝叶斯逆向规划模型结合，用于计算某一代理行动后可能的心智状态概率。

Conclusion: 融合方法利用了两者优势，为社交智能生成代理与未来ToM模型研发提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的知识图谱推理方法大多着眼于单一形式的神经或符号推理，难以有效整合两者优势，同时主要针对单一推理场景，难以满足复杂的真实世界需求。

Method: 提出Tunsr框架，引入一致性的推理图结构，并利用前向逻辑消息传递机制进行推理节点的表征更新，以及通过FARI算法动态学习一阶逻辑规则。

Result: 在四种推理场景（跨导、归纳、插值和外推）的19个数据集上验证了Tunsr框架的高效性。

Conclusion: Tunsr实现了神经和符号推理的统一，同时能应对多种推理场景需求，在知识图谱推理领域具有良好的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Motivation: 研究人员对LLMs的使用存有怀疑，因为其可能存在幻觉、偏见和对研究的潜在危害，因此有必要明确LLMs的优缺点，以保证其有效且负责任的应用。

Method: 分析了LLMs的能力和局限性，并通过计算生物学（HIV反弹动力学建模）的案例研究展示了与ChatGPT进行迭代互动如何促进跨学科协作和研究。

Result: 研究表明，将LLMs作为一种辅助工具融入包含“人类参与”的框架中，能推动跨领域创新性研究。

Conclusion: 负责任地使用LLMs将提高跨学科研究的效率，并大幅加速科学发现的进程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过基于代理的架构增强LLM问答系统推理能力的方式，发现可以有效减少用户交互次数，提高答案质量，并使问题的解析更具可解释性，但可能增加调用次数和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs被广泛用于问答场景，但单轮交互难以解决由于上下文不足或歧义问题，因而需要设计增强型架构来自动解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将LLMs结合零样本ReAct代理，模型可以选择分类、解析或回答三种操作，专门针对检测和解决问题的不完整性与歧义性。

Result: 引入代理后，相较于单纯使用LLM，减少了人机交互长度、提升了回答质量并带来了可解释的解析过程，但代价是可能增加调用次数和延迟。

Conclusion: 基于代理的框架在上下文不足时能显著增强问答系统的鲁棒性，尽管存在一定的性能成本，其优势在多数场景下更为显著。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理组织复杂性，从分散的知识中恢复信息，而无需直接接触领域专家，为记录隐性知识提供了新思路。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的帕累托前沿图不能有效比较具有不同优缺点的LLMs，对此，作者希望寻找新的方法定量化这些差异。

Method: 通过提出经济评估框架，将LLMs的性能权衡用误差成本、延迟成本和查询放弃成本表达为一个经济数字，来实现模型的经济效用比较。

Result: 在MATH基准测试上的研究表明，当错误成本超过$0.01时，推理模型的性价比优于非推理模型；当错误成本低至$0.1时，单一大型LLMs通常优于模型级联。

Conclusion: 在自动化的重要人类任务中，推荐使用最强大的模型，而不是仅仅尝试减少部署成本，因为AI错误的经济影响通常远大于部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

*Xinyi Wu,Yanhao Jia,Luwei Xiao,Shuai Zhao,Fengkuang Chiang,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Uni-Retrieval的轻量高效多模态检索模块及其增强版本Uni-RAG，用于优化教育领域的检索与生成系统。实验表明，Uni-RAG在准确性和生成质量上优于基线，同时保持低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统难以应对教育场景中查询多样性和模糊性的问题，因此需要一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，以提升教育内容的生成和检索能力。

Method: 开发Uni-Retrieval模块，通过查询原型匹配和基于MoE-LoRA的动态Prompt Bank，增强对未知查询类型的适应能力；将其与经过指令微调的语言模型结合，形成完整的Uni-RAG系统，用于检索和生成教育内容。

Result: 在SER和多模态基准测试上，Uni-RAG系统在检索准确性和生成质量上均优于传统方法，同时保持低计算成本。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG提供了一种可扩展、教育学驱动的智能教育系统解决方案，能够支持多样化的教育场景下的个性化、可解释和高效的学习辅助。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种新颖的黑箱测试技术，通过区分代理错误和环境不可行性来识别自主代理的不良行为原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理和环境的复杂性增加，识别自主代理不良行为的错误来源变得更加困难但却至关重要。

Method: AIProbe通过修改配置参数生成环境配置和任务，然后通过搜索规划器独立解决每个任务，并将代理性能与规划器解决方案进行比较，以区分代理模型或策略错误与任务不可行性。

Result: 在多个领域的评估显示，AIProbe在检测总错误和独特错误方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: AIProbe为自主代理的可靠部署做出了贡献，在将不良行为归因方面表现出色。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

### [422] [LLMs model how humans induce logically structured rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03876)
*Alyssa Loo,Ellie Pavlick,Roman Feiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）如何在逻辑概念规则归纳的实验中，与基于贝叶斯方法的语言思维模型相比，表现出类似甚至更优秀的能力，同时揭示了LLMs可能提供对人类逻辑概念新的理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类认知的基本结构和发展，包括认知的原始表征单元及其规则，以及这些规则从何而来，同时探讨人工神经网络在解释抽象认知功能领域（如语言和逻辑）的有效性。

Method: 通过四个实验，测试各种大语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑概念规则归纳现有实验范式中的表现，并将其与贝叶斯概率语言思维模型（pLoT）进行比较，分析LLMs对规则推导和任务完成方式的定性预测。

Result: 研究结果表明，大语言模型（LLMs）在这些任务中与贝叶斯模型（pLoT）表现相当，甚至更优，并展现了对规则推导的不同预测，体现其并非单纯的pLoT解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs可能提供一种新的关于原始表征和计算的理论视角，有助于解释人类逻辑概念的发展，未来认知科学研究应该进一步探讨这一前景。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的兴起使得AI从被动计算工具转型为自主的经济行为主体，这一转变需要新的经济基础设施来支持这些智能体的动态角色。

Method: 设计了一种名为AEX的专门拍卖平台，以实时竞价（RTB）为灵感，构建四大生态组件：用户侧平台(USP)、代理侧平台(ASP)、代理中心(Agent Hubs)和数据管理平台(DMP)，实现协调、性能跟踪和安全知识共享等功能。

Result: 通过提出的AEX平台，为未来AI的经济基础设施设计提供了参考，实现了对智能体市场的动态支持。

Conclusion: AEX为未来的智能体经济奠定了基础，以推动AI生态系统中的经济行为自治和价值交换。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于幻灯片动画建模的公开数据集，以及改进的LoRA方法，显著提升了动画任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于幻灯片生成的AI工具缺乏动画支持，现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理时间推理和动画建模任务上的能力有限。

Method: 构建了首个公开数据集，包含12000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和视频，并使用LoRA方法微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型，提出新的CODA评价指标。

Result: 优化的LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L和CODA指标上均优于GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro，特别是在覆盖率和细节保真度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型及CODA指标为基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成提供了重要基准和研究基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对单一LLM存在的幻觉和推理能力不足问题，同时克服现有多智能体争辩方法中输入过多和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CortexDebate方法，构建一个稀疏的争辩图，仅让有协助作用的LLMagent之间进行争辩，并引入基于McKinsey信任公式的MDM模块进行图优化。

Result: 实验表明，CortexDebate在四类任务的八个数据集上表现卓越。

Conclusion: CortexDebate通过模拟人脑的稀疏且动态优化网络，有效提升了多智能体争辩的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不可满足公式的核心原因对多个应用领域至关重要，当前已有研究方向集中在尽可能快速地枚举或计数最小不可满足子集（MUS），但效率仍待提升。

Method: 提出了一个基于答案集编程的框架MUS-ASP，将MUS枚举问题形式化为答案集求解问题，利用当前最先进的答案集求解系统的计算能力实现高效解决。

Result: 实验评估表明，MUS-ASP在MUS枚举和计数任务中表现出色，特别是在集成混合求解器中进一步加速任务完成。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP框架展示了答案集编程在解决复杂组合优化问题上的潜力，为提高MUS相关任务的效率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）生成不准确且高置信度回复的问题，并着重研究一种结合隐藏状态特征与数据无关特征的方法以提升领域外任务的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs容易生成事实错误却高信度的内容，提升其对正确性评估的能力成为必要。通过使用隐藏状态训练探针的方法已被证明有效，但存在跨领域泛化性不足的问题。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，并探讨筛选最重要隐藏状态特征后的性能表现，试图提升跨领域任务的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，引入数据无关特征在大多数情况下能提升泛化性能，但某些场景下反而会降低性能；特别是筛选最重要隐藏状态特征后，数据无关特征的作用不一致。

Conclusion: 训练探针时隐藏状态特征常被赋予更高权重，可能是导致数据无关特征未能稳定提升性能的关键原因。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

Conclusion: Lyria框架综合了LLMs和遗传算法的优点，能有效应对复杂问题，是一种可行的解决方法，具有潜在的推广价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities
across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized
by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense
solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior
semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search
and optimization capability of genetic algorithms, we propose to capitalize on
their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic
algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its
performance.

Motivation: 在法律智能领域存在静态基准与动态实际需求之间的差距，这成为了先进开发的主要障碍。

Method: 创建J1-ENVS环境，涵盖中国法律实践中不同复杂性的六种场景，同时设计了J1-EVAL评估框架针对任务表现和程序合规性进行细化评估。

Result: 17种LLM模型实验显示，大多数模型虽然具备法律知识，但在动态场景中程序执行较弱，包括最先进的GPT-4o整体表现也未达60%。

Conclusion: 现有的动态法律智能发展存在明显挑战，本文成果为后续研究提供了新的思路和参考价值。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

Motivation: 多代理系统面临异构实现、缺乏标准化接口、协作框架不够灵活、调度策略静态以及状态同步不足等问题，需要一个高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: 设计了具有五个层次框架的HAWK（用户、工作流、操作员、代理和资源），支持16个标准化接口，实现了从任务解析到工作流编排、智能调度、资源调用和数据同步的全流程。核心是工作流层的自适应调度和优化模块，结合实时反馈和动态策略调整。

Conclusion: HAWK框架有效地解决了多代理系统的关键挑战，并具有广泛的行业应用潜力，未来的研究方向包括幻觉减缓、实时性能优化和增强跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

Motivation: 解决开源系统在多步任务复杂性和高计算成本上的劣势，推动LLM网络代理的开源发展。

Method: 使用两阶段训练管道：第一阶段通过监督微调（SFT）使小模型模仿大模型；第二阶段采用基于策略的强化学习优化性能，并通过采样和自举估计有效超参数来规避耗时的参数搜索。

Result: 结合SFT和基于策略的强化学习的方法优于单独使用任何一种方法，在MiniWob++上实现同样性能仅需55%的算力，同时能够唯一步入闭源模型表现区间。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了算力使用，突破了算力-性能的帕累托前沿，为开源LLM网络代理追赶闭源系统提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for
aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical
challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective
alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing
RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and
scalability.

*Sibei Liu,Zhijian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）训练中学习率调度（WSD）的机制，通过类比Mpemba效应，提出了高平台学习率对衰减速度的加速作用，提供了一种新的调度原理及参数调试建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的学习率调度策略主要基于经验，缺乏理论解释，尤其是在平台学习率选择和衰减设计上仍具有启发性和随意性，因此需要探索更具理论支撑的学习率调度方法。

Method: 通过类比训练动态和热力学中的Mpemba效应，分析了'谷-河'型损失景观特征，提出高平台学习率能够加速衰减阶段的收敛速度，并进行了分析与建模以提供理论支持。

Result: 研究表明，存在一个最优平台学习率（"强Mpemba点"），能使某些损失景观的最慢模式消失，从而加速衰减阶段的训练收敛，并给出了检验此现象的数学条件和调度所需的衰减动力学。

Conclusion: 这一工作提供了学习率平台调度策略的理论依据，证实了高平台学习率对于加速收敛的作用，并为大语言模型的学习率调试提供了新的指导方向。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Motivation: 探讨如何利用扩散模型用于聚类任务以克服高维数据中复杂结构的挑战。

Method: 通过教师-学生范式，利用扩散模型生成多样化的簇分配，学生网络精炼这些分配以形成稳定预测，并将扩散过程的随机性视为数据增强方式。

Result: CLUDI在复杂数据分布上的无监督分类任务中达到了最新的性能表现，展现了优越的聚类鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: CLUDI成功将扩散模型应用于聚类任务，为复杂高维数据的分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决如何将ASP和SMT有效整合以处理离散与连续变化问题，特别是在增强行动语言C+领域。

Method: 基于函数稳定模型语义提出ASPMT框架，支持组合连续与离散变化。将C+语言的语义重新定义为ASPMT形式，并用SMT求解器计算。

Result: 证明了ASPMT能够增强C+语言的表达力，支持累积影响表示，并可以处理复杂的连续资源变化问题。

Conclusion: ASPMT框架不仅延续了ASP与SAT的紧密关系，还能通过SMT求解器计算C+中的离散和连续问题，显示了其在建模和求解上的潜力。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

*Xingyang He,Xiao Ling,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大规模推理模型（LRMs）尽管具有强大的推理能力，但存在冗余和低效问题，SmartThinker通过差异化的推理长度控制解决这一问题，从而优化推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模推理模型因推理过程中的冗余和低效导致显著的计算浪费，现有方法采用全局长度惩罚，但存在过度压缩关键推理步骤的问题。因此，需开发一种能根据每一步重要性进行精细控制的框架。

Method: 提出两阶段的SmartThinker框架：第一阶段通过拒绝采样和监督微调适应短形式推理模式；第二阶段采用步骤级长度控制策略优化（SCPO）优化输出分布，具体包括在线重要性估计器、步骤级长度控制奖励函数等四个核心模块。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试和不同模型上展示了SmartThinker显著减少了冗余推理，同时在性能上媲美或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过在推理链每一步实施精细长度控制，实现了推理效率和准确性的双赢，证明了其在优化大规模推理模型中的应用价值。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出WebSynthesis框架，利用学习的世界模型模拟虚拟网络环境，实现高效、可逆的树状规划生成轨迹，用于改进代理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的语言模型在复杂动态的网络环境中缺乏高级的轨迹规划能力，而现有的方法存在环境不稳定和API成本高的两大问题。

Method: 提出一种名为WebSynthesis的新框架，通过世界模型模拟虚拟网页环境，并利用树状规划生成高质量轨迹，用于训练代理。

Result: 实验表明，使用WebSynthesis在小规模合成数据集训练的代理，其表现能达到甚至超越使用大规模真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: WebSynthesis框架能够以低成本方式大规模产生高质量轨迹，从而改进模型策略，实现高效的自我改进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Conclusion: MOD-X提供了一个真正去中心化、可扩展的代理生态系统框架，在理论形式和实际实施之间搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

### [441] [DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381)
*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多变量时间序列预测，提出了DC-Mamber模型，通过结合Mamba和线性Transformer方法，同时捕捉局部和全局时间依赖关系，提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的时间序列预测方法在捕捉局部时间模式和处理全局时间依赖方面存在不足，其中Transformer复杂度高，Mamba难以并行整合全局上下文信息。

Method: 提出了DC-Mamber模型，构建了基于Mamba的通道和基于线性Transformer的通道分别提取变量间和全局时间依赖特征，最后通过融合层整合双通道特征以实现预测。

Result: 在8个公共数据集上的实验表明，DC-Mamber在预测精度上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber模型通过结合Mamba的高效特性和Transformer的全局依赖建模能力，提升了多变量时间序列预测的表现。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在自然语言理解和生成中表现突出，但其易出现事实错误，限制了其在知识密集型任务中的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种注意代赝的分层对比解码方法，通过在不同的模型层分别抑制特定标记类型的注意力来改进事实生成。

Result: 无需额外训练或修改模型，该方法在多种大语言模型和基准测试中显著提升了生成内容的事实性。

Conclusion: 通过优化标点和概念性标记的层间互动模式，可有效提高大语言模型的事实性表现，这为改进LLMs提供了新的非训练式方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARMR方法实现了更个性化和精确的药物推荐，为医疗决策提供了有力支持；源码已开源便于社区复现与扩展。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Result: 在超过14,000条模拟轨迹实验中，所提方法达到了最先进的性能，AUC为0.90，F1分数为82.2%，在召回率和F1分数上，分别超越了基础监督和无监督方法39%和12%。同时，该方法在多种噪声与未知异常类型上表现出色的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRAP框架不仅具有较强的性能优势，还克服了现有方法在噪声和未知环境中的局限性，证明了其在自动驾驶车辆异常检测中的有效性和实际潜力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

TL;DR: 研究了一种隐私保护下的序列决策模型，提出Rec-APC方法，证明了最优策略收敛性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私政策和技术变化影响，推荐系统不能访问个体数据，只能使用群体偏好信息，这对推断用户偏好和优化推荐提出挑战。

Method: 提出Rec-APC模型，并通过分支界限算法计算最优策略，结合贝叶斯更新进行用户偏好推断，同时引入二元反馈机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，与POMDP求解方法SARSOP相比，Rec-APC在用户类型数量较多的情况下收敛更快、效果更优。

Conclusion: Rec-APC模型在受限的群体偏好数据背景下表现良好，为此类问题的决策提供了新方法和新思路。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

Motivation: 当前XAI方法在提高模型透明性的同时，存在泄露个人隐私数据的风险，且缺乏有效的防御方案。

Method: 研究了3种PETs（合成训练数据、差分隐私训练和噪声添加）对两类特征解释式XAI的影响，并进行了综合评估。

Result: 整合PETs后，攻击风险在最佳情况下减少了49.47%，同时保持了模型效用和解释质量。

Conclusion: PETs可以在XAI中有效降低隐私攻击成功率，同时最大化实用性，建议进一步优化策略以平衡隐私保护和系统性能。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Result: 证明这些抽象概念在生物和人工智能系统中的适用性，展示了理论和实际之间的联系。

Conclusion: “核心与边缘”原则在广义智能构建中具有实际意义，并为智能系统设计提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多尺度时间序列预测方法存在冗余规模共享特征问题，导致模型难以有效捕获复杂的时间模式。

Method: 提出一种时间解耦模块分别捕获规模共享和规模特有的时间表示，并引入两项正则化条款保证共享表征的一致性及特有表征的差异性。

Result: 大规模实验表明，与现有基线相比，DisMS-TS可使准确性最高提升9.71%。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过消除多尺度冗余特征在时间序列分类任务中表现出色，有效提高了预测性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

Motivation: 希望提高现有RL微调方法的效率，减少提示评估和策略更新的高耗计算成本。

Method: 提出Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS)，一种基于贝叶斯的风险预测方法，通过迭代的近似评估选择提示，无需频繁LLM推导。

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，在数学、规划和基于视觉的几何任务中显著减少LLM推导次数，加速模型训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS通过贝叶斯采样和建构多臂老虎机机器，提供了一种高效的提示选择策略，有效解决了因频繁交互导致的计算开销问题。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Method: 通过在模型生成的对话历史中注入恶意内容，再辅以无害的用户提示，触发对有害内容的生成，并验证其攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 现代对话AI存在根本性安全缺陷，需要从输入过滤转向对对话上下文完整性的协议级验证，以提升安全性。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服会话推荐系统中由于长尾分布导致的头部过拟合、表示漂移和尾部稀疏性问题。

Method: 引入了一种包含三层协作的框架：自适应综合聚焦损失（ACFL）、通过原型学习优化长尾推荐的语义表示，以及GPT-4o驱动的对话增强模块。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准数据集上，LumiCRS在Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10上比15个强基线高出7-15%；人类评估也证实其生成内容的流畅性、信息丰富性和长尾相关性更优。

Conclusion: LumiCRS通过多层框架的协作，克服了会话推荐系统中的长尾问题，提升了整体性能并突出了其有效性和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1是一种层次化奖励驱动的强化学习框架，用于生成既功能正确又优化硬件质量(PPA)的RTL代码，测试结果表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时优化RTL代码的功能正确性和硬件质量(PPA)，传统监督学习或后处理技术存在局限性，难以提升LLM的设计能力。

Method: 提出ChipSeek-R1，采用层次化奖励体系，通过强化学习直接使用语法、功能正确性及PPA指标反馈，模型通过试错学习硬件设计权衡，从而优化代码生成。

Result: ChipSeek-R1在标准基准测试中取得了功能正确性方面的先进结果，尤其是在RTLLM基准测试中生成了27个PPA优于原人类编写代码的RTL设计。

Conclusion: 将工具链反馈集成到LLM训练中是有效的，通过强化学习生成超越人类设计的RTL代码具有潜力并意义重大，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Activation-Steered Compression (ASC)的方法，通过调整模型的残差激活空间来压缩大语言模型的推理过程，从而减少推理时间和资源消耗，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在推理过程中包含冗长的中间步骤（CoTs），导致资源浪费和性能问题。

Method: 通过提取和注入“引导向量”以调整模型的激活空间，ASC在推理时缩短CoTs，无需重新训练模型，并依据KL散度约束分析了输出分布的影响。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上，使用仅100对数据例子，ASC实现了CoT长度平均减少67.43%，并在8B模型上实现2.73倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: ASC方法以最小的运行时开销，在资源敏感的场景下提供了一种高效的推理过程压缩工具，为推理能力强大的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

### [462] [MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident Severity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为MARBLE的多代理规则基础大语言模型引擎，用于解决交通事故严重性预测中的挑战，并表现出超越现有方法的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的交通事故严重性预测方法存在数据不完整、强特征依赖性和严重类别不平衡的问题，特别是对稀少但高严重性案例的检测效果不佳。此外，当前方法缺乏可扩展性和可解释性，难以适应实际环境中的噪声数据。

Method: 论文提出了MARBLE，这是一种基于多代理规则的大语言模型引擎，通过将预测任务分解给一组专门的推理代理。每个代理关注特定语义子集（如空间、环境、时间等），从而实现模块化推理，并通过规则或LLM引导的共识机制协调结果，保留推理轨迹以增强解释性。

Result: MARBLE在英国和美国的数据集上表现出色，准确率接近90%，显著优于传统机器学习分类器和现有最先进的推理方法（如CoT、L2M和ToT），这些方法的准确率较低（不超过48%）。

Conclusion: MARBLE不仅改善了事故严重性预测的性能，还提供了强大的通用性和解释性，这使它在安全关键应用中的不确定性推理任务上具有极大的潜力。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决AA-CBR模型中存在的多余案例（或称为“尖峰”）问题，同时保留模型的核心特点。

Method: 模型通过让过去的案例参与辩论，支持或反对不同的标签，新增支持机制以改良辩论流程。

Result: 证明了改良后模型sAA-CBR不存在无用的案例（尖峰），这提升了模型的效率和性能。

Conclusion: sAA-CBR成功改进了AA-CBR模型，实现了一个无冗余案例的分类系统，同时保留了原模型的关键特性。

Abstract: We introduce Supported Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(sAA-CBR), a binary classification model in which past cases engage in debates
by arguing in favour of their labelling and attacking or supporting those with
opposing or agreeing labels. With supports, sAA-CBR overcomes the limitation of
its precursor AA-CBR, which can contain extraneous cases (or spikes) that are
not included in the debates. We prove that sAA-CBR contains no spikes, without
trading off key model properties

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了基于模仿学习（IL）和强化学习（RL）的方法在CholecT50外科动作规划任务上的表现，发现IL在精准性和一致性上显著优于RL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究外科手术动作规划，其目标是提供实时精准的动作预测以辅助医生操作，并探索IL和RL在提升动作规划性能上的潜力。

Method: 提出了基于双任务自动回归模仿学习的基线模型DARIL，并与三种不同RL方法（基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL、增强反向RL）进行对比实验。

Result: DARIL在10秒规划的mAP表现达到29.2%，显著优于任何一个RL方法，其中RL的表现指标在10秒预测中分别跌至3.1%和15.9%。

Conclusion: 结论表明IL相比RL在当前任务上更适合，强调了专家注释分布匹配的重要性，并挑战了关于强化学习在序列决策中总是优越的假设。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Motivation: 研究如何将因果知识应用到描述性知识所无法处理的外部干预效果预测上。

Method: 将分层的逻辑程序翻译成因果系统，利用哲学和现有研究方法建立稳定模型的因果解释。

Result: 稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必要性和未观察效应的无关性等哲学因果原则。

Conclusion: 分层的逻辑程序框架适用于因果建模，并能有效预测干预效果。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

TL;DR: 论文研究了知识图谱推理中的未知选择偏差和分布外问题，提出了一个名为StableRule的框架来改进泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱推理方法受I.I.D假设限制，无法应对未知的样本选择偏差或测试时的分布变化。

Method: 提出了StableRule框架，结合特征去相关和规则学习网络，以提高分布外的泛化性能。

Result: StableRule在七个基准知识图谱上表现出卓越的效果和稳定性，适应多种异构环境。

Conclusion: StableRule框架在实用性和增强知识图谱推理的泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨域点击率预测方法在数据稀疏和新数据连续集成场景下存在困难。

Method: 提出了GIST模型，解耦源域和目标域训练流程，采用CBJT模块对齐内容与行为分布，并使用ASI策略增强知识迁移。

Result: GIST在离线评估和线上A/B测试中优于现有方法，并成功部署于小红书平台，服务数亿日活跃用户，显著提高广告系统性能。

Conclusion: GIST模型为跨域点击率预测提供了一种高效、可持续的方法，解决了现有方法在工业场景中的不足。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare
applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to
healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of
healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical
vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma
demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong
foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Conclusion: TALENTS框架在快速变化及复杂的协作情境中表现出色，提供了一种有效的即席团队协作方法。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

Motivation: 作者旨在解决链式思维监控在运行时防止严重危害时的关键特性——可监控性，而非其“忠实性”，以提高AI安全防御效果。

Method: 提出了区分CoT作为合理化过程和作为计算过程的概念框架，通过增加不良行为的难度迫使模型暴露其推理过程，强化监控。另外设计了方法指南以测试CoT监控的可靠性。

Result: 实验证明模型在有显著外部帮助下可以学习隐藏意图，但在正常环境下CoT监控仍具有较大的防御作用。

Conclusion: 尽管存在潜在的局限性，链式思维监控提供了重要的防御层，仍需主动保护和持续压力测试。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

Conclusion: 研究表明ASA-CaB算法在优化电子分诊工具上的潜力，为急诊科患者分诊提供了更具精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源盗窃检测随着智能电表的广泛应用成为一个关键问题，现有AI模型虽表现优秀，但高计算和能源成本限制了其实用性，尤其是在低窃取场景中。

Method: 设计了一种轻量检测单元，作为触发LSTM模型的前置过滤器，仅激活高疑似能源窃取的实例，减少输入量，同时保留检测精度。

Conclusion: 通过降低推理时的能耗与保持系统可扩展性，该研究提出了一种面向可持续发展的能源窃取检测方法，为现代智能电网部署提供参考。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

Method: 通过便携式近红外光谱仪获取光谱数据，结合 PCA 提取特征，并实施多种机器学习算法（如 RF、SVM、NN 等）进行分类。

Result: 随机森林算法表现最佳，ROC-AUC 达到 0.8826；SVM 紧随其后，精确率与召回率表现均衡；而神经网络展示了最高的召回率（0.7804）。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

understudied. This work empirically examines whether pre-trained large-scale
time series models (LSTSMs) trained on diverse datasets can outperform
traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific
small-scale architectures. The results highlight scenarios where pretraining
offers advantages and where simpler models remain competitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在欧几里得空间中运行，难以有效捕捉大脑网络的内在层级结构，因此需要一个更有效的多模态数据融合方法。

Method: 设计了HKGF框架，包括多模态图构建模块、超曲率空间图表示学习模块（基于HKGNNs）、跨模态耦合模块以及超曲率神经网络预测模块。

Result: 实验覆盖4000多名受试者数据，HKGF在两项神经认知退化预测任务中优于最新方法。

Conclusion: HKGF提供了一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，能够客观量化与神经认知退化相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

Conclusion: GSOP提供了一种高效且实用的VLM运算优化方法，提升了计算效率，同时保持较高的性能表现。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Method: 利用HuBERT的自我蒸馏机制，直接用学生模型替换原始模型，保留相同的自监督学习目标，避免额外的模块和结构约束。

Result: 在SUPERB实验中，DiceHuBERT在语音识别任务上性能提高了21%以上，ASR任务性能提升超过14%。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT方法显著优于现有蒸馏技术，并展示了多任务的竞争力。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛适用于诸如碳排放分析等复杂区域问题的研究，提供可操作性见解，并表明模型的定量特征可能优于人类的主观分析。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Echo State Transformers (EST)，通过结合变压器的注意力机制与储备计算的原理，解决了传统变压器在长序列处理中的二次复杂性问题，并在低数据环境下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型与变压器结构在某些认知任务的表征上与人脑处理方式存在差异，同时在处理长序列数据时复杂性增长显著，亟需更高效且低数据依赖的模型。

Method: 引入了一种名为EST的混合架构，将变压器的注意力机制与储备计算结合形成了固定大小的分布式内存系统，包括一个受Echo State Networks启发的新模块“工作记忆”，通过并行运行的多个随机递归网络作为内存单元实现动态适应，同时优化储备超参数，实现固定内存单元数量与恒定计算复杂度。

Result: EST在STREAM基准测试中的12项序列处理任务中，在8项任务上超越了GRUs、LSTMs及标准变压器，显示了其在低数据和资源受限环境中的优越性。

Conclusion: EST在低数据和计算资源受限的环境中展现了超越传统GRUs和LSTMs，并补充了标准变压器的潜力，是一种有效的长序列处理解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,

Motivation: 当前分子预训练模型难以精准捕获专家在分子设计中的隐性推理能力，MolProphecy旨在结合专家知识提升预测准确性和可解释性。

Method: 框架将ChatGPT用于虚拟化学家模拟专家推理，通过语言模型嵌入化学知识，并通过门控交叉注意力机制融合知识与图结构特征，用于协同推理。

Result: 在FreeSolv等四个基准数据集上超越SOTA模型，RMSE减少15.0%，AUROC提高5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy有效结合专家知识与分子结构特征，在提升预测表现与可解释性之外，还具有可扩展性，支持与真实化学家协作的灵活使用。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有反应式或基于时间的维护方法无法有效预防故障的问题，提出提高运营效率和降低服务成本的解决方案。

Method: 研发基于物联网传感器和机器学习算法的预测性维护系统，通过实时监控机器组件和运行状态预测故障。

Result: 通过模拟故障数据和分类算法评估，显著提升了早期故障检测能力，减少冗余服务干预。

Conclusion: 预测性维护框架在提升运营效率和服务可靠性方面效果显著，适合集成到自动售货机基础设施中。

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial
environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

TL;DR: 提出使用基于Fock空间表示的无参数图编码器，与预训练LLM协作回答图相关问题，达到高效通用的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何结合预训练的大语言模型(LLM)更高效地理解和回答关于图结构数据的问题，实现更少监督和更强的泛化能力。

Method: 通过引入基于Fock空间表示的无参数图编码器，并结合前缀调优方法，与冻结的预训练LLM整合使用。

Result: 所提出的方法在处理从简单图到蛋白质图和超图的图相关问题上表现优异，无需对体系结构做大幅调整。

Conclusion: 本研究简化了现有解决方案，并实现了对多种图结构的无缝泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Motivation: 时空预测任务通常需要高复杂度的模型，但这些模型存在训练效率低和内存消耗高的问题。

Method: SDKD将复杂教师模型的多尺度时空表示知识传递给高效的轻量化学生网络，并提出了频率对齐的知识蒸馏策略，从教师模型中提取多尺度频谱特征来指导学生网络。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效捕获高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度，为时空预测应用带来新的可能。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 当前研究中尚未深入分析多头注意力机制在理论上的优势，因此本文旨在从理论和实践两个角度理解其比单头注意力更具优势的潜在原因。

Method: 将多头注意力重新定义为一个协同计算图系统，并分析其混合时间和最小最大保真度。此外，通过实验比较了在相同参数条件下单头和多头Transformer在序列操作任务中的表现。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明，在特定的头部多样性条件下，多头注意力有助于信息传播的协同增强，提高了模型的混合效率和保真度。

Conclusion: 多头注意力机制在理论和实验上均表现出优于单头注意力的特性，证明了其更高效的信息处理能力和协同作用。

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InvisibleInk框架，允许将在长文本生成中安全地整合私密信息，并保证差分隐私，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在长文本生成中安全整合私密信息的问题，旨在实现高效且隐私保障的文本生成。

Method: 通过将LLM的下一词分布视为对数几率上的指数机制，并采用两项创新：一种是仅隔离并截断私密信息对数几率；另一种是从top-k私密token的超集进行采样，以提升文本质量。

Result: 在隐私水平一致情况下，与同类顶尖基线相比减少了8倍的计算成本，同时保证生成的长文本效用不降低。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk实现了在长文本生成中以少于非隐私生成10倍的计算成本生成带有隐私保障的长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医学领域问答中的广泛应用，其回答的准确性和证据支持问题越来越受到关注。

Method: 使用了检索增强生成（RAG）系统进行比较分析，包括改良的Alexandria系统和两个基于PubMed的检索系统。从医生提交的上千个问题中分析两类系统的表现。

Result: PubMed系统对44%问题提供了证据支持的答案，Alexandria系统则为50%。结合两者，可以为超过70%的医学问题提供可靠答案。

Conclusion: 为了最大化大语言模型的价值，需要开发能够检索已发表或定制生成证据的系统，甚至实时生成相关证据。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Conclusion: 本文的方法可扩展当前临床专业知识的限制，推动稀有疾病患者的可扩展识别和分层，为临床护理和研究提供支持。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对内在几何如何影响学习能力的理解，并为结构化数据领域的深度学习提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive
chatbots and robotic control.

theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI改变了数据的价值和意义，但传统数据保护方式不再适用，同时数据需要保护的范围不明确，带来了社会和个人风险。

Method: 提出了一个四层级的数据保护分类，分别为不可用性、隐私保护、可追溯性和可删除性，并分析了每一层级的代表性技术方法和监管盲点。

Result: 该分类框架展示了在AI系统从训练数据到AI生成内容过程中，数据效用与控制之间的权衡，并识别了当前存在的监管盲区。

Conclusion: 通过提供一个结构性的框架，该研究为制定可信的AI数据保护实践提供了方向，唤起对现代AI数据保护方式的重视，并为开发者、研究人员及监管者提供指导。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ACRSLF模型，用于高维不完整数据的优化问题，通过自调节三次正规化和多Hessian-向量积评估，提升表示精度和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据在现实应用中广泛存在，但由于二阶潜在因子模型的双线性和非凸特性，导致优化问题复杂，需开发更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出自调节三次正规化（cubic regularization）技术和在共轭梯度迭代中采用多Hessian-向量积评估以更精确获取二阶信息。

Result: 在两个工业高维不完整数据集上的实验结果表明，ACRSLF模型比现有优化器模型收敛更快，且表示精度更高。

Conclusion: 新模型ACRSLF有效克服了SLF模型优化中的非凸性问题，实现了性能提升，适合高维不完整数据分析应用。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

TL;DR: Optimas是一种优化复合AI系统的框架，通过局部奖励函数（LRF）对系统组件进行优化，提升整体性能，实现了平均11.92%的性能改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合AI系统包含多种组件，由于其非可微结构及多样化配置，优化变得困难，亟需一种通用有效的优化方法。

Method: 提出Optimas框架，核心是为每个组件维护一个局部奖励函数（LRF），调整LRF以最大化局部奖励，同时确保其与全球性能一致，从而实现组件独立优化。

Result: 通过五个实际复合系统测试，Optimas在性能上平均比强基线提升了11.92%。

Conclusion: Optimas为复合系统优化提供了一种通用且有效的方法，显著提升了系统整体性能。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Conclusion: 为了发展人工认知，AI领域需要摆脱单纯依赖机器学习优化方法的局限性，寻求新的方法。

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在人类决策中的广泛应用，其公平性和避免对敏感属性的偏见显得尤为重要。

Method: 作者提出了一个运行时验证框架，通过一个新定义的规范语言，可捕捉许多常见的算法公平属性，并设计两类监控算法，对系统生成的事件序列实时估算公平性。

Result: 实验展示了框架在银行贷款和大学录取场景中的应用，监控器能在每次观察后不到一毫秒内更新结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速高效地监测和量化算法公平性提供了一个可行的解决方案，在理论和实践方面均具备优势。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的规模增长，通过量化和稀疏化等效率化压缩技术优化存储和性能显得至关重要。

Method: 研究了8:16半结构稀疏性及其对性能阈值的影响，并应用稀疏结构模式处理显著权重，结合方差校正和权重均衡方法提升模型性能。

Result: 相比2:4稀疏性，8:16稀疏性更灵活，存储开销少，并且处理权重离群值的结构化稀疏性实现了与非结构化方法相当或更优的结果。

Conclusion: 8:16稀疏模式是一种有效的模型压缩方法，可在性能与存储之间实现更优平衡，简单的优化技术能进一步提升稀疏模型性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Motivation: 当前在线学习对数学评估的需求增大，但自动评分学生手绘图像的问题研究较少，因此希望通过多模态元学习模型解决这一痛点。

Method: 作者使用多模态元学习模型对包含手写图和文字的图像进行自动评分，并比较其与视觉大规模语言模型（VLLMs）的表现。

Result: 元学习模型在二分类任务中表现更优，而VLLMs在更复杂的三分类任务中略胜一筹。

Conclusion: 尽管VLLMs展示了潜力，但由于其可靠性和实用性尚存疑点，需进一步研究以确定其可行性。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于移动数据采集方法存在局限性（如GPS采集频率低或通信事件中的CDR数据只捕获有限位置），导致移动数据往往稀疏，需要更好的方法来准确重构移动数据。

Method: 提出了BERT4Traj模型，借鉴了BERT的掩码语言建模目标和自注意力机制，结合空间、时间嵌入及背景信息（如人口统计、锚点），用于预测稀疏轨迹数据中的隐藏点。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的真实CDR和GPS数据集上进行评估，BERT4Traj模型的性能显著优于传统方法如马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能够有效地重构详细且连续的移动轨迹，为分析人类移动模式提供了增强的洞察力。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Helmholtz机由于对称、数据驱动的更新限制了其目标导向推理的能力和时间延续过程的模拟。

Method: C$^2$HM通过一个循环一致的变分方法，将基于目标的推理与观测结果对齐，通过前向生成和逆向优化实现潜在状态的模拟和匹配。

Result: C$^2$HM改进了表示效率，支持依赖路径的记忆推理，并实现了空间组合性的模拟能力。

Conclusion: C$^2$HM提供了一种生物学启发的推理方法，将生成建模重新概念化为一种意图驱动的模拟，在记忆型规划和无监督学习之间架起了新的桥梁。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的目标误泛化可能导致代理在部署时偏离设计者的初衷，研究如何降低这种风险对安全泛化至关重要。

Method: 通过形式化目标误泛化问题，并从理论上分析不同训练目标下的表现，如最大期望值(MEV)目标和最小最大期望后悔(MMER)目标；此外，进行了基于网格世界环境的实验证明。

Result: 结果显示，基于MEV的标准训练方法容易发生目标误泛化，而目前基于MMER的环境设计方法对目标误泛化表现得更为鲁棒。

Conclusion: 最小最大期望后悔(MMER)是减少目标误泛化的一个有前景的方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，可在地球科学和天文学等领域进行动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

Motivation: 现有符号回归方法难以同时支持显式和隐式关系的发现，并且通常对每个表达式候选者独立处理，未能重复利用结构模式以加速搜索。

Method: 提出SymMatika，一种融合了多岛遗传编程和可复用模式库的混合符号回归算法，利用高影响力子结构指导进化，并采用反馈驱动的进化引擎，同时支持显式和隐式关系发现。

Result: SymMatika在多个基准测试中表现出色，Nguyen数据集恢复率提升5.1%，首次恢复Nguyen-12，且在Feynman方程表现具有竞争力；在Eureqa数据集上恢复隐式物理规律速度提升到100倍。

Conclusion: 结构感知的进化搜索在科学发现中具有巨大潜力。SymMatika提供了开源的完整框架以支持可解释建模和符号发现研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Conclusion: BLaST方法显著降低了AI系统的能耗、内存占用和延迟，为下一代大规模AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next

computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

TL;DR: 本研究发现大型语言模型(LLMs)在自信与怀疑的态度上表现出冲突特性，通过实验解释这一矛盾行为背后的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解LLMs为何在初始回答中表现过于自信，同时又对批评反馈表现出过度敏感。

Method: 设计了一个实验范式，在不创建初始判断记忆的情况下，获取LLMs的信心估计，通过对比分析LLMs对一致和不一致建议的反应，揭示其行为机制。

Result: LLMs具有显著的选择支持偏差（choice-supportive bias）和对矛盾反馈的过度敏感性，这使得它们倾向于保持前后一致性，但对批评反馈反应过度，表现出非规范性的贝叶斯更新。

Conclusion: 这些行为解释了LLMs自信心矛盾的根源，揭示了它们在一致性驱动和矛盾敏感性之间的相互作用机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Motivation: 当前DG任务面临重大挑战，现有方法多依赖单值预测，限制了模型的鲁棒性。本文旨在探索通过集合预测克服此局限性，并最小化预测集合大小。

Method: 提出了一种理论框架，定义集合预测在DG设置中的成功标准，同时设计了一种优化方法，能平衡未知领域的鲁棒性能与小预测集合的要求，并兼容现代学习架构。

Conclusion: 本文展示集合预测在提升未知领域鲁棒性方面的重要性，并证明此方法在理论和实践上的可行性，为DG问题提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

*Weishu Deng,Yujie Yang,Peiran Du,Lingfeng Xiang,Zhen Lin,Chen Zhong,Song Jiang,Hui Lu,Jia Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合CPU-GPU注意力机制(HGCA)，解决了大语言模型(LLM)推理过程中GPU内存受限的问题，支持长上下文生成并保持近乎完全的注意力质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文生成需要大量的键值缓存(KV)，这对GPU内存造成了限制，现有方法处理效果不佳，亟需一种高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HGCA机制，将最近生成的KV保留在GPU进行稠密注意力，同时在CPU上对选定的、突出的KV进行稀疏注意力，且通过对数求和进行结果融合。引入了优化CPU执行的逐头稀疏化策略，减少计算和PCIe传输开销，同时无需模型重训练。

Result: 在各种模型和工作负载上实验表明，HGCA具有更好的可扩展性，支持更长的序列和更大的批量大小，与现有稀疏注意力方法相比在性能和准确性上都有明显提升。

Conclusion: HGCA能够高效地实现大语言模型的推理任务，克服了GPU内存限制问题，并为现有模型框架提供了无缝集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出PiCME方法，利用对比学习整合MIMIC数据集中的五种临床数据类型，并引入模态加权LSTM以解决多模态下的性能下降问题，提高预测性能和模型公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习在临床预测领域的应用主要集中在图像和文本对，未能充分整合多种患者数据，且多模态数据的性能存在停滞或下降问题。

Method: 提出了名为PiCME的管道，预训练对比学习模型以结合多种模态数据，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM对模态进行加权，根据各模态的重要性优化预测性能。

Result: PiCME在三模态下表现竞争力，在五模态设置中引入Modality-Gated LSTM后，AUROC从73.19%提高至76.93%，AUPRC从51.27%提高至62.26%。

Conclusion: PiCME首次实现在MIMIC中对所有模态组合的对比学习扩展，为模态选择、训练策略和公平临床预测提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有人工智能视觉与人类视觉之间的显著不一致问题，例如对纹理特征过度依赖、图像失真敏感，以及对对抗性攻击的脆弱性等。

Method: 提出了一种人类启发的视觉课程，名为‘发育视觉饮食(DVD)’，以模仿人类视觉发展的过程逐步引导AI模型学习。

Result: 所提出的方法显著增强了AI模型对形状的依赖，提升了对抽象形状的识别能力，加强了其对图像失真和对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，性能超过参数更高的大规模AI基础模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化模型的学习方式而非单纯增加数据量，可在资源节省的前提下实现更加安全且自然的人类化AI视觉系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为LaTF的框架，将表示学习与生成建模紧密结合，以解释和分析复杂分子系统的平衡分布及其与环境因素（如温度）的依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂分子系统的平衡分布及其与温度等环境因素的关系对理解热力学特性和转变机制至关重要，同时需要低维可解释的表示来支持分析。现有生成模型（如正态化流）虽然有潜力，但缺乏专门的表示学习来扩展其适用范围。

Method: LaTF框架结合了State Predictive Information Bottleneck（SPIB）和正态化流（NFs），集成表示学习与生成建模，同时学习低维表示（称为Collective Variables, CVs）、分类亚稳态、生成超出训练数据范围的平衡分布。两部分通过联合优化，保证表示抓取系统慢速与重要自由度，生成模型再现系统平衡行为。

Result: 在多种系统（如模型势、Chignolin蛋白、集群Lennard Jones粒子）上验证了LaTF的有效性，并通过多种指标和模拟进行benchmark。在针对RNA四联环的应用中，即使仅使用两个温度下的数据，也能够重构温度相关的结构集合及熔解行为，与实验和先前计算结果一致。

Conclusion: LaTF框架能够实现复杂分子系统的深入热力学特性学习和低维表示生成，为研究相关现象和机制提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型仍需大量资源，现有零阶优化方法在多百亿参数模型上受到GPU内存和计算吞吐量的限制。

Method: 提出DistZO2框架，引入三种并行策略：扰动并行（PertP）、分布式数据并行（DDP）和统一的2D并行设计，并通过硬件感知的通信策略优化参数块的传输。

Result: 在OPT-175B模型上的实验表明，DistZO2在分布式计算场景下相较于ZO2实现了3倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: DistZO2克服了ZO2在单设备上的局限，扩展至多GPU系统，显著提升了零阶微调的训练效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in
https://github.com/liangyuwang/zo2.

Motivation: 提出在动态路由模型中加入神经抑制，以解决现有混合专家模型、动态路由和变压器模型中选择路径不够高效的问题。

Method: 通过神经抑制算法，在神经元群体中抑制共享信号，从而让动态路由模型为每个数据样本选择最适配的专用路径。

Result: 经实验验证，加入神经抑制后，网络模型在多种任务上的性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 神经抑制机制作为一种提升动态路由模型的重要方法应得到更多关注和研究。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Motivation: 目标是解决如何通过交互式问答任务实现最小化查询次数，同时保证预测性能。在此过程中发现传统信息追求方法因信息熵估算不准确导致性能受限。

Result: 实验表明C-IP在“20问”和医疗交互场景数据集(MediQ)上相比传统方法具有更短的查询链条、更高的预测性能和更好的解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP通过结合符合预测集的优势，克服了传统方法中估算误差的挑战，在交互式问答场景中的表现更为优异，同时保持了良好的模型解释性。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Motivation: 在Sentinel-5P数据受云遮蔽影响缺失等问题的背景下，探索利用低秩特性提高数据重建和分析的有效性。

Method: 采用基于CANDECOMP / PARAFAC分解和交替最小二乘法的低秩张量模型（LRTM）对S5P-TN数据的缺失值进行修复，并与地统计学的空间插值法进行对比分析。

Result: 实验表明，低秩张量模型在广泛云遮蔽条件下有效重建缺失值，预测异常值并识别热点，且具备较强的时空统计分析能力。

Conclusion: 低秩张量方法在处理大规模动态时空大气数据中表现优异，为未来相关数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论框架、泛化能力以及计算效率上均表现优异，为深入优化域适应方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

Result: 综合评估显示MGAA在多种LLMs骨干模型及基准数据集上的性能优越，尤其在多模态模型LLaVA上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MGAA有效解决了传统低秩压缩方法的弊端，优化了大模型压缩效率，并兼顾了性能保持及计算资源节约。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

*Zizhao Wang,Kaixin Wang,Li Zhao,Peter Stone,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dyn-O的增强型对象中心化世界模型，在复杂环境中展示了优异性能，优于当前主流模型DreamerV3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的世界模型大多集中于对象间交互的动态，但在复杂环境中的研究有限，促使探索能更好通用化和刻画动态的对象中心化世界模型。

Method: 设计了基于对象中心化表示的Dyn-O，结合了动态无关和动态相关特性以改进表示学习和动态建模。

Result: 在复杂的Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O实现了从像素观测直接学习对象中心化世界模型，并在预测准确性上超越DreamerV3。

Conclusion: Dyn-O不仅提升了模型的预测能力，还展示了细粒度特性操控的能力，为复杂环境中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing
Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP
scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple
problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art
results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于解决不规则采样时间序列因果发现问题的新方法ReTimeCausal，通过整合ANM和EM方法，改进现有因果推断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多尺度交互和不规则采样时存在局限，而神经网络方法缺乏解释能力，本文试图通过整合物理引导的数据插补和稀疏因果推断来填补这一关键空白。

Method: 提出ReTimeCausal方法，将加性噪声模型(ANM)和期望最大化(EM)相结合，通过核化稀疏回归和结构约束，迭代改进缺失值估算与因果图的构建。

Result: ReTimeCausal在不规则采样和数据缺失条件下显著优于其他方法，其性能在多个综合和真实数据集实验中得到验证。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal方法解决了不规则采样时间序列中的因果发现问题，体现了其准确性与可解释性，提出了新颖的多尺度因果推断框架。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Conclusion: MPX工具箱提升了JAX在大规模神经网络训练中的性能和易用性，是相关开发者的有力工具。

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source
code, documentation, and usage examples are available at

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅增进了对注意力机制复杂性随层级变化的理解，还为更高效的线性注意力模型设计提供了切实的改进方案。

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

effort. Unlike existing codebases, ObjectRL is built on Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the
implementation, modification, and evaluation of new algorithms. ObjectRL lowers
the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use
cases that highlight its flexibility and suitability for rapid prototyping. The

Conclusion: MAFG框架有效解决了传统特征生成方法的局限性，为自动化处理科学数据提供了强大工具，具有广泛潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对所有网络层使用统一学习率，忽略了不同组件的独特动态。

Method: 引入相对学习率方法（RLRS），调整Transformer模型组件权重的学习率，超参数可在小模型上调试并扩展到更大模型。

Result: 在复杂模型训练中提速高达23%，如Mixture of Experts（MoE）。

Conclusion: RLRS方法显著减少训练时间和计算资源，为优化大规模神经网络提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去中心化的差分隐私优化框架DOME，利用紧凑草图将梯度投影到低维子空间，有效降低通信成本和噪声影响，同时保持隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习与差分隐私方法面临梯度传输维度高和差分隐私噪声随维度增加的问题，作者发现梯度更新具有强相关性且存在于低维子空间。基于此，作者提出对梯度进行投影和紧凑化处理。

Method: 提出DOME框架，用紧凑草图对梯度进行低维投影，并加入正交随机扰动以保持子空间的动态扩展和平衡。在此架构下兼顾降低通信成本和满足$(\epsilon, \delta)$-差分隐私。

Result: 通过低维投影，将每轮通信量从原始维度减少到低维子空间的大小，对梯度的均方误差从$\sigma^2 d$减小到$\sigma^2 k$。

Conclusion: DOME框架在保留隐私性和差分隐私保证的前提下，有效缓解通信和噪声增长的成本问题，同时提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Method: 引入连续的$K$步聚合操作取代传统的多层堆叠机制，简化核计算过程，同时通过将无限宽的图神经网络建模为高斯过程提出SGNK，无需逐层计算即可获得核值。

Result: SGTK和SGNK在节点和图分类任务中实现了与现有方法相当的性能，并显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: SGTK和SGNK提供了一种高效且表达能力强的图神经网络核方法，为图数据的处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Conclusion: KLDM通过创新性地解决晶体的坐标表示问题，为生成晶体材料提供了有效的新方法，其性能得到了一系列任务的验证。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 需要可靠的点预测和可解释的不确定性量化，以准确估算高风险场景中的个体治疗效应。

Method: 通过分解蒙特卡洛Dropout，将预测总方差分为表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。对深度因果效应模型的不确定性来源进行诊断分析。

Result: 在三种合成协变量偏移场景下，间隔校准良好（ECE < 0.03），满足方差分解关系；在真实数据中，不同不确定性源表现出显著差异，尤其在分布外样本中表示不确定性占主导地位。

Conclusion: 提出的分解框架提供了一种有效的诊断工具，可以检测和解释深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Result: 展示了该方法对Rossler系统的隐状态恢复以及噪声污染数据的动力学重建能力，在高噪声条件下依然能准确恢复正确动力学形式。对神经系统还提出了符合生物约束的新的支配方程，并验证了预测的有效性。

Conclusion: PEM-UDE方法在噪声困难条件下表现优越，不仅可用于复杂动力学系统的研究，还为建立从神经元到脑宏观活动的多尺度大脑模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source

<details>

Motivation: 目前神经算子方法在单物理场建模中表现出色，但在处理多物理耦合场应用时仍然缺乏研究，特别是非线性强耦合问题。

Method: 设计和评估了DeepONet及其GRU扩展版本（S-DeepONet）的不同网络架构，包括单分支和多分支架构，在三种耦合强度不同的多物理场问题上进行对比分析。

Result: 实验发现网络架构需要与物理耦合强度对齐：单分支网络在强耦合场景中表现优越，多分支网络适用于弱耦合或单物理问题。此外，这些网络在推理阶段比高精度有限元求解器快1.8万倍，同时保持解的精确性。

Conclusion: 神经算子架构应该根据目标物理系统的耦合强度进行设计，才能有效捕获耦合多物理场中的非线性相互作用。

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近来工作表明在含有安全漏洞的代码上微调大型语言模型会导致行为失调，激发了对狭窄领域微调可能引起有害行为的担忧。

Method: 采用了一系列实验，包括输出概率分布分析、损失函数与梯度向量几何分析、分层激活动态和激活空间维度的研究，探索狭窄领域微调对内部机制及行为表现的影响。

Result: 揭示了微调不安全代码导致的内部变化会破坏模型对齐性，并发现对齐行为由模型激活空间中一个共享的潜在维度控制，此空间既受不安全代码激活，也受更普遍的失调响应激活。

Conclusion: 细化解释了此前观察的错位现象，强调了模型对齐性的脆弱性，并提出需要更稳健的微调策略以在不同领域中保持预期行为。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Motivation: 由于电力系统的日益复杂和去中心化，准确的电力消耗预测对于电网稳定性和发电优化尤为重要。传统方法难以捕获能源网络内在的空间依赖性，因此提出利用图神经网络（GNNs）利用图拓扑结构来增强预测性能。

Result: 实验表明，尽管复杂架构（如GATv2和TransformerConv）并未始终优于简单模型，但GCN和APPNP在数据较少或高度分散的情况下表现出色。而GAT在两个数据集上同样表现强劲，并通过注意力机制提供了额外的解释层次。

Conclusion: 虽然注意力机制并非总是最佳选择，但在具有突出的空间依赖性情况下，其解释能力极具价值。同时，采用基于专家聚合的策略能够增强模型的鲁棒性，在数据异质性下超越单一模型的表现。

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为FAROS的新框架，通过属性切换机制提升生成图的公平性，并在基准数据集上展示了这一方法可以在保持准确性的同时有效减少公平性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图扩散模型（GDMs）可以生成逼真的网络结构，但未能很好地解决生成数据的公平性问题。

Method: 提出FAROS框架，通过在预训练GDM的生成过程中直接切换节点的敏感属性，利用多准则约束优化属性切换节点比例和生成过程中的切换步骤。

Result: 实验表明FAROS在链接预测任务中减少了公平性差异，同时在准确性上表现出色，甚至在某些情况下优于竞争方法。此外，该框架在某些测试设置中基于帕累托最优性能够更好地权衡准确性和公平性。

Conclusion: FAROS通过多准则约束实现了生成图公平性与准确性的有效平衡，证明了其作为公平生成框架的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

*Magda Dubois,Harry Coppock,Mario Giulianelli,Lennart Luettgau,Cozmin Ududec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯广义线性模型的统计框架，用于评估自动评分器的可靠性和偏差。同时支持对大语言模型的性能和偏差进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评分器虽然具有高效性，但可靠性有限且可能存在系统性偏差。研究动机在于开发一种方法，既能评估评分器的表现，也能解决LLM的研究问题。

Method: 采用基于贝叶斯广义线性模型的方法，建模评分结果与评分对象属性的关系，量化评分差异与潜在偏差，同时提供不确定性估计和分歧来源分析。

Result: 该模型能够增强传统可靠性指标（如评分一致性）的效果，并为评分偏差和分歧提供更明确的解释。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有助于提升自动评分器在LLM评估中的鲁棒性和可解释性，用于性能评估和偏差检测。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

*Eren Dogan,Matthew R. Guthaus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GNN的后布局有效电容建模方法GNN-Ceff，其通过GPU并行化显著提高速度并改善精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有效电容计算需要布线或者估算布线性能的效率和准确性问题，从而改进集成电路设计流程中的时序分析。

Method: 提出GNN-Ceff模型，利用图神经网络和GPU并行化技术进行后布局有效电容的快速且准确的建模。

Result: 在真实基准测试中，与当前最先进的串行方法相比，GNN-Ceff实现了929倍的速度提升，同时精度更高。

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为改进VLSI设计流程提供了一种高效且准确的后布局有效电容建模方法，使时序分析阶段更可靠且快速。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

*Md Mokarram Chowdhury,Daniel Agyei Asante,Ernie Chang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为IMPACT的框架，通过重要性感知的激活重建技术更有效地压缩大模型，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）性能优秀，但因模型体积较大，在资源受限的环境中部署困难。目前流行的低秩权重矩阵压缩方法假设权重是低秩的，但在LLMs中这一假设通常不成立，因此需要转向激活的低秩特性。

Method: 提出了IMPACT框架，基于优化目标结合激活结构与梯度敏感性，导出一个闭式解。最佳重建基底是基于加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量，从而进行优化的低秩近似以保留模型精度。

Result: IMPACT在各种模型和任务中实现了模型大小的最多48.6%的额外缩减，并在性能上可与最新的基线方法相媲美。

Conclusion: IMPACT框架提供了一种原则性的模型压缩方法，相较于传统方法不仅更有效减小模型体积，还能确保准确性无显著损失。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [563] [MatRL: Provably Generalizable Iterative Algorithm Discovery via Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03833)
*Sungyoon Kim,Rajat Vadiraj Dwaraknath,Longling geng,Mert Pilanci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架MatRL，用于自动生成计算矩阵函数的迭代算法，其性能优于现有多个基准算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计矩阵函数的最佳迭代算法需要调优众多参数且可选方法繁多，因此需要一种自动化的高效算法设计方式来应对现代计算环境。

Method: 通过将算法设计视为序列决策问题，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索规划出针对特定输入矩阵分布及计算环境的混合迭代序列及步长。

Result: 实验表明，MatRL生成的算法在计算效率上优于文献中多种基准方法，并且理论上可以推广到足够大的同分布矩阵。

Conclusion: MatRL展示了利用强化学习技术自动优化矩阵函数迭代算法的潜力，为解决类似自动化算法设计问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式等变图神经网络(eGNN)实现，用于高效地处理大规模原子结构的电子结构预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由密度泛函理论(DFT)数据训练的eGNN在处理超长相互作用图时的内存需求和计算规模限制问题。

Method: 设计了能直接进行GPU通信的分布式eGNN实现，同时引入了输入图的分区策略以减少GPU之间的嵌入交换。

Result: 在Alps超级计算机上实现了强扩展性支持到128个GPU，以及在3,000到190,000原子规模的结构中，512个GPU的弱扩展性能达到87%的并行效率。

Conclusion: 通过分布式实现和图分区方法，显著提高了大规模材料电子性能预测的效率和可扩展性，为研究具有复杂结构的材料提供了工具。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文讨论在医疗成本模型中，通过对高维回归中的ICD-10诊断码进行粒度简化，提升模型稳定性和一致性，同时保留可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归模型在处理高维医疗诊断码时，因稀有数据导致回归系数不稳定，需优化此问题以提升模型在医疗数据分析中的表现。

Method: 通过缩减ICD-10诊断码位数，从7字符减少至6字符或更少，降低维度，从而增强回归模型参数稳定性。

Result: 此方法增加Hessian矩阵迹值，降低回归系数估计方差，更好地平衡精确性与解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，相较细粒度的ICD-10码，采用更粗分类如DRG和HCC代码可实现更稳定和一致的医疗成本模型，兼顾现实需求与模型性能。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that
detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习在量化化学中的表现受限于中性、闭壳层分子，而实际化学系统往往具有复杂特性，因此需要一个能够涵盖多种分子体系的通用框架。

Method: 提出了OrbitAll框架，它结合了基于量子力学方法的自旋极化轨道特征和满足SE(3)等变性的图神经网络架构。

Result: OrbitAll在预测带电、开壳层和溶剂化分子时表现优越，并在较小数据集下取得与竞争模型媲美的化学精度，同时在计算速度上比密度泛函理论快约10^3到10^4倍。

Conclusion: OrbitAll展示了基于几何和物理启发的深度学习模型在大分子和复杂体系上的广泛潜力，为量化化学研究提供了高效、精准的工具。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出通过将低维的自适应滤波器权重流形作为约束的改进FxLMS算法，使用神经网络训练滤波器权重，并在潜在空间中进行更新以提高收敛效率和稳态误差表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FxLMS算法在主动降噪中有效，但局限于目标位置噪声场的最小化。通过利用噪声或控制源的空间信息，可以改进算法的收敛效率。

Method: 利用自编码器训练获得稳态自适应滤波器的低维流形权重，将其作为约束以生成滤波器，然后通过潜在变量空间调整进行优化更新。

Result: 实验表明，在特定条件下，Latent FxLMS比标准FxLMS具有更快的收敛速度，同时在稳态误差方面表现相当。

Conclusion: 在低维流形约束下优化FxLMS算法的潜在空间更新方法可有效提高算法性能，具有潜在实际应用价值。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

Motivation: 解决时空动态预测中复杂空间关联及非线性时间动态建模的挑战，尤其针对非规则几何域的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架TK-GCN：第一阶段使用Koopman增强的图卷积网络（K-GCN）在潜在空间中实现状态的线性演化动态嵌入；第二阶段使用Transformer模块在潜在空间中建模长期时间依赖。

Result: 实验结果和消融研究表明，TK-GCN在多种预测范围内比其他技术有更高的预测准确性。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能够有效建模复杂时空动态，特别是在随时间进行非线性变化的复杂心脏动态预测中表现出色。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: 高阶PINNs方法通过结合符号计算和神经网络模型，显著提升了ODE相关问题的求解精度，特别在处理参数及初始条件变化时效果明显，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that

TL;DR: 该论文展示了神经网络并非真正的不透明，其泛化能力来自于动态将数据集映射到模型函数的局部极值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经网络的泛化能力，寻找新的算法来替代反向传播，并解决梯度消失与过拟合问题。

Method: 通过证明神经网络的局部极值个数与参数数量正相关，提出极值增量算法替代传统的反向传播算法。

Result: 极值增量算法能合理解释并处理神经网络中的梯度消失与过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 神经网络的泛化能力与其局部极值特性相关，新的算法框架为理解与优化神经网络性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GPI的统计框架，利用生成式人工智能模型（如大语言模型）处理非结构化数据，实现因果和预测推断，且无需模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果和预测推断方法在处理文本和图像等非结构化数据时存在效率低或扩展性差等问题，因此需要一种新的方法以简化此过程并提高效率。

Method: GPI框架利用生成式人工智能模型对非结构化数据进行低维表示提取，并结合机器学习算法进行因果和预测推断，而且无需对生成模型进行微调，显著提升了计算效率。

Result: GPI框架在三个应用场景中展示了其实用性：分析中国社交媒体审查，预测候选人外貌对选举结果的影响，以及评估政治修辞的说服力。

Conclusion: GPI提供了一个有效且易于使用的工具，可以利用生成式模型高效处理非结构化数据，同时支持多种应用，展示了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both
causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and
images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型，用于预测阿尔茨海默病患者下一次临床访问的疾病进展阶段，并对其与其他模型进行比较，结果显示该模型在缺失数据情况下具有较强的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病威胁全球数千万人，早期检测关乎干预效果，因此需要高效的预测工具。

Method: 使用Transformer模型分析患者访问历史数据，预测下一阶段的疾病进展，并与RNN等模型严格对比，研究特征权重和时间序列优化模型的效果。

Result: 提出的Transformer模型在数据缺失情况下依然表现出强大的预测性能，尤其是在识别疾病阶段转换患者方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示，Transformer模型有助于改进阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断和临床干预效果。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架用于优化静态光谱风险度量（SRM），改善分布式强化学习(DRL)中风险敏感策略的效果，并证明了该方法在理论和实践上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多在线和离线强化学习算法中集成风险度量的方法存在局限性，可能导致次优策略，特别是在需要高度风险敏感性的场景中，例如最坏情况下的结果会造成严重后果的情况。

Method: 提出一种新的框架，用于优化静态光谱风险度量（SRM），通过广义化的风险度量目标（如CVaR和Mean-CVaR）来定制风险偏好，并将其应用于在线和离线强化学习算法。理论部分证明在有限状态-动作场景中该方法的收敛性。

Result: 通过广泛的实验评估，证明新框架和算法在不同领域的在线和离线环境中一贯优于现有的风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 使用提议的SRM框架可以显著提高风险敏感型强化学习算法的性能，使其能够更好地处理需要定制风险偏好的复杂场景，并提供理论收敛保证。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将生成模型和替代模型分离的优化框架，用于复杂结构域中的优化任务，并验证其在分子优化问题上的效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将替代模型和生成模型紧密耦合的方式往往因潜空间未针对具体任务优化而性能欠佳，因此需要探索新的优化方法。

Method: 提出了一种分离式框架，将生成模型（VAE）和高斯过程（GP）替代模型独立训练，并通过贝叶斯更新规则将其结合。

Result: 分离式方法在分子优化问题中，尤其是在受限评估预算下，提高了发现高潜力候选分子的能力。

Conclusion: 该分离方法的优势在于利用了生成模型和替代模型各自的长处，为优化复杂结构域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在基准数据集上具有显著优越性。

Conclusion: CAPIMAC在多模态数据填充与融合上表现出色，公开代码以供研究者验证和使用。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN通过结合GNN的学习能力与mol-infer框架的灵活性，实现了更高效的化学化合物推断，展现了良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MCST-Mamba的多通道时空预测模型，用于解决交通预测中的多变量问题，具备较少参数下的高效预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测是智能交通系统的关键，但由于动态路况、多样的交通模式及外部因素等，使预测极具挑战性。并且，现有方法多为单变量预测或需多个单独模型，难以捕捉多通道间的联合模式。

Method: 引入MCST-Mamba模型，基于Mamba状态空间架构，通过自适应时空嵌入，解耦时间序列与传感器空间交互，构建专用Mamba模块以提升表征能力。

Result: MCST-Mamba模型在处理多变量输入时实现了优异的预测性能，相较于基线模型显著减少了参数数量。

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba更实际地模拟交通拥堵的特性，并提供了一种高效的多变量交通预测方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor

Conclusion: 在Transformer中融入显式的层次结构信息能够有效提升源代码表示任务的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Abstract: The ability to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with constraints is
instrumental in improving the fairness of modern machine-learning models. Many

fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package

Motivation: 现有的数据影响评估方法难以直接应用于SAM，原因在于其双层计算结构增加了复杂性，同时对参数进行数据影响建模较为困难。

Method: 基于影响函数(IF)，提出两种数据评估方法：Hessian-based IF和Gradient Trajectory-based IF。前者通过依赖训练模型权重的闭式度量提供全面估计，后者利用训练过程中的梯度轨迹信息实现更准确、高效的数据评估。

Result: 实验结果验证了两种方法在数据评估和参数调整方面的有效性，在标注错误数据识别、模型编辑和可解释性提升等领域都有所应用。

Conclusion: 两种数据评估方法为SAM模型下的数据影响建模提供了创新解决方案，以应对通用化和计算复杂性的挑战。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

### [590] [Accurate and Efficient World Modeling with Masked Latent Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04075)
*Maxime Burchi,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种新的世界模型EMERALD，用于提升智能体性能，并在Crafter基准测试中取得了突破性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Dreamer算法在压缩的潜在空间中损失信息，限制了智能体表现，而训练直接从像素出发的模型效率低下。作者期望设计一种既精确又高效的世界模型。

Method: 提出了一种名为EMERALD的新型世界模型，利用带有MaskGIT预测的空间潜状态，在潜在空间中生成精确的轨迹以提升智能体表现。

Result: 在Crafter基准上，EMERALD首次超过了人类专家水平，并在10M步内完成了所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD通过精准、高效的潜在空间建模，显著提升了智能体的表现并在多项基准上实现了突破性成果。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Method: 基于排序子群的不变性特性，从几何深度学习的角度分析常见的注意力机制，并根据其关系偏置进行分类。

Result: 注意力层可以通过其隐含的输入数据关系假设进行特征化分析。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同注意力机制根据其归纳的输入数据关系假设的差异性，这提供了理解和改进这些机制的新视角。

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

*Ziming Hong,Runnan Chen,Zengmao Wang,Bo Han,Bo Du,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了从不可信的非可迁移学习教师模型中进行数据无关知识蒸馏问题，并提出一种名为ATEsc的方法，通过筛选和过滤OOD样本，改进了知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据无关知识蒸馏方法大多假定教师模型可信，然而针对不可信教师模型的鲁棒性和安全性研究较少，亟需探索更完善的解决方案。

Method: 提出了ATEsc方法，利用教师模型对样本的对抗鲁棒性对合成样本进行分组：将脆弱组视为ID-like数据用于正常知识蒸馏，将鲁棒组视为OOD-like数据用于忘记OOD知识。

Result: 实验表明，ATEsc能够有效增强数据无关知识蒸馏的性能，特别是在面对非可迁移学习教师模型时表现出色。

Conclusion: ATEsc为提升不可信教师模型情况下的数据无关知识蒸馏效果提供了新的思路，凸显了识别与过滤OOD样本的关键性。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在无相对位置信息的情况下，GNNs是否可以替代Transformer应用于单细胞转录组学等领域。

Method: 分析了GNNs与Transformers在编码策略和相对位置处理上的相似性与差异；设计了无相对位置的合成示例进行等效性验证；在大规模无位置感知数据集上开展实验对比。

Result: GNNs在单细胞转录组学等无位置感知任务中表现出与Transformers相当的性能，且计算资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: GNNs在某些无位置感知任务中能替代Transformer，为单细胞转录组学等领域提供了新视角，挑战了Transformer始终是最佳选择的传统观念。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Method: 开发了一种基于TM学习动态推导出的概率评分方法，并引入不确定性量化技术，同时使用模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集进行验证。

Result: 显示TM概率评分与数据概率之间的联系，并发现TM在训练数据域外的预测信心较低。此外，CIFAR-10分类实验表明新的方法可以提供改进的见解。

Conclusion: TM的概率评分与不确定性量化技术增强了其预测的解释性，同时提供了对现有图像分类模型优化的潜在方向。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

Abstract: Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through

integration with deep learning frameworks. We present JAX-MPM, a
general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a
unified, scalable platform for differentiable meshfree simulation and
data-driven geomechanical inference.

Result: 实现了77%的预测精度，发现气象条件是主导因素，污染呈现季节性和日常周期波动，冬季明显高于夏季，交通高峰期波动显著。此外，污染数据从2014至2022年改善了31%。

Conclusion: 智能预测系统可为城市规划者和环境管理者提供有效工具，有助于实施早期预警和优化城市规划，推动改善城市空气质量。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

Conclusion: 论文为扩散模型核心公式提供了详细的数学推导和理论支持，深化了对模型结构的理解。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘方法通过训练目标中加入待删除的私密信息，但这可能强化数据暴露或违背最小化使用原则。

Method: 提出PMC方法，利用生成模型对自身生成的训练易导致分布塌陷的特性，触发敏感数据的部分塌陷，达到信息移除效果，并提供理论证明其收敛性。

Result: 实验验证PMC方法比现有明确优化目标的遗忘方法更高效地删除模型输出中的隐私信息。

Conclusion: PMC方法代表了实现与现实隐私约束更一致的全面遗忘的一步重要进展。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Result: 即使只用线性肽训练，模型生成多样化且目标特异性的环肽，成功率达到38%-84%。

Conclusion: CP-Composer突破了训练数据限制，实现了高效环肽生成，为医疗领域带来新可能性。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

Motivation: 目标是扩展压缩感知中的NIHT方法，以在限制线性测量条件下恢复高阶低秩张量。

Method: 提出了TNIHT算法，结合CP秩和Tucker秩来表征张量低秩性，并基于TRIP性质建立了算法的收敛性理论。

Result: 通过在合成数据、图像和视频上的实验，验证了TNIHT相较于其他算法的性能优势。

Conclusion: TNIHT能够有效恢复低秩张量，其理论证明和实验结果均展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前变压器成本高而亚二次架构无法有效支持长序列的训练，同时一些技术（如滑窗注意力）虽然降低了成本，但对上下文学习能力有负面影响。

Method: 提出了可独立调整状态大小的线性成本序列建模架构层“power attention”，并开发了一套GPU内核以提高操作效率，规避内存与带宽瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中性能优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention在解决现有长序列建模中的不足方面具有显著优势，并提升了上下文学习性能。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Motivation: 改善大语言模型的安全对齐性，避免对无害提示的过度拒绝，提高用户体验和模型实用性。

Method: 引入一个名为ACTOR的框架，通过分析内部激活模式，精准调整触发拒绝机制的激活成分，仅对单层进行微调。

Result: ACTOR在多个基准测试中有效降低了过度拒绝行为，并保持了对有害查询的处理能力和总体实用性。

Conclusion: ACTOR方法能以高效且强鲁棒性的方式降低过度拒绝问题，为大语言模型的性能和安全性找到平衡点。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Abstract: High dimensionality in datasets produced by microarray technology presents a
challenge for
  Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, particularly in terms of dimensionality
reduction and
  handling imbalanced sample sizes. To mitigate the explained problems, we have
proposedhybrid
  ensemble feature selection techniques with majority voting classifier for
micro array classi f
  ication. Here we have considered both filter and wrapper-based feature
selection techniques
  including Mutual Information (MI), Chi-Square, Variance Threshold (VT), Least
Absolute
  Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and
Recursive
  Feature Elimination (RFE), followed by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for
selecting the
  optimal features. This Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach leverages a
Majority Voting Classifier
  that combines multiple machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression
(LR), Random

performance and
  accuracy. By leveraging the strengths of each model, the ensemble approach
aims to provide
  more reliable and effective diagnostic predictions. The efficacy of the
proposed model has
  been tested in both local and cloud environments. In the cloud environment,
three virtual

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Conclusion: 方法不仅可以实现基于部分数据的优化控制，还能推导出历史长度的最优选择及控制策略架构，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联邦学习中数据分布和模型架构的异质性问题，提出了一种新的基于原型的方法ProtoNorm，通过优化原型分布和放大原型幅值提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的原型联邦学习方法因原型的分离性较差，限制了其区分能力，需要一种更高效的方法来改进原型分离度。

Method: 提出ProtoNorm框架，包括两部分：1.原型对齐，通过模拟汤姆森问题优化角度分离；2.原型放大，提高原型在欧几里得空间的分离度。

Result: 通过基准数据集的实验证明，ProtoNorm能更好分离原型，性能优于现有异质性联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm兼具通信效率和服务器端优化的优点，非常适合资源受限环境中的联邦学习应用。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中由于资源限制导致的通信效率问题，特别是在高维特征和多类别情境下的效率下降问题。

Method: 提出TinyProto方法，包括类原型稀疏化（CPS）和自适应缩放，其中CPS通过将特定维度分配给类原型并只传输非零元素来实现结构化稀疏，自适应缩放则根据类别分布调整原型。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，TinyProto可将通信成本降低最多4倍，同时仍能保持学习性能。

Conclusion: TinyProto不仅降低了通信开销，还支持异构架构且无客户端计算开销，非常适合资源受限的异构联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Conclusion: CLAGA成功解决了跨组分配不一致性问题，提高了CATE估计的准确性。

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Result: 未来帧预测在作物映射上达到69.6%的IoU并在大规模印度数据集上超过基线模型，时间频率预测在产量预测上误差降至30.7% MAPE。

Conclusion: 以农业时间特性为核心设计的自监督学习任务可显著改善农业遥感应用。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Conclusion: D3QN通过强化学习实现了恶意软件分类的动态特征选择，比随机森林和静态特征选择方法表现更优，以显著的计算效益保持较高准确率。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Conclusion: 本文证明了从因果角度建模HRL子目标结构的有效性，在理论和实验两方面均有优势。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

Conclusion: APCs展示了强大的表示学习能力，利用了PC的概率推断特性，为稳健推断、分布外检测和知识提炼提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Motivation: 传统应用分类方法无法提供细粒度的特性标签，作者旨在通过分层多标签分类解决这一问题，以更好服务于用户建模等下游任务。

Method: 文章主要提出了HMCN（分层多标签分类网络）和HMCL（分层多标签对比学习）两种方法，分别从分类和表示学习两个层面优化应用程序标签的分层分类精度。

Result: 在腾讯应用商店和其他公共数据集上验证显示，该方法较现有技术有优越表现。同时，该方法已部署到腾讯，并在用户信用风险管理任务中提升了10.70%的KS指标性能。

Conclusion: 提出的分层多标签分类方法不仅在实验中表现出色，也成功应用于实际场景，为推荐系统及风险管理等业务改进提供了显著的价值。

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，以更准确地评估大语言模型（LLMs）的对抗性鲁棒性，强调尾部风险的建模，并通过融合采样提升攻击成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对抗性攻击方法通常仅针对单点生成的有害响应，忽略了LLMs的随机特性。需要开发更全面的评估框架以应对大规模模型部署中的安全与鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出一种新的对抗性鲁棒性评估框架，将攻击过程建模为优化和采样之间的资源分配问题。通过引入采样，增强传统攻击策略的有效性和效率，并提供一个基于最大熵的无数据优化目标验证新框架的适用性。

Result: 将采样融入现有攻击策略后，攻击成功率（ASR）提升了48%，效率提高了两数量级。此外，分析发现大多数优化策略对输出有害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 提出的尾部风险感知攻击方法和评估协议对准确评估LLMs的安全性与加固策略有重大意义，同时启示了新的优化目标。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过控制弹性权重耦合参数，可有效调整迁移学习中源任务和目标任务的特征共享，以提升学习性能。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ESSA框架，通过进化策略(ES)对大型语言模型(LLMs)进行高效对齐，比传统的RLHF方法更加节省成本和稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在使LLMs对齐人类偏好时，现有的RLHF方法计算成本高，内存要求高，且训练不稳定，特别是当模型规模扩大时问题尤为突出。

Method: 作者提出使用一种名为ESSA的框架，基于进化策略(ES)对LLMs进行对齐，通过参数高效的架构修改实现低秩适配，从而降低优化维度，并且无需梯度计算和大量超参数调整。

Result: 在数学推理任务上测试结果显示，ESSA方法比基于梯度的方法（如GRPO）收敛速度更快，且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: 研究表明，ESSA是一种在大规模语言模型后训练对齐中可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法在领域特化任务中存在计算效率低下和性能欠佳等问题。

Method: 利用梯度稀疏分析确定子网络，并只更新该子网络作为优化目标，同时通过减少矩阵乘法实现高效微调。

Result: 在性能几乎无损的情况下，LoSiA需要的训练时间远少于现有方法，且LoSiA-Pro相较于LoRA减少了约27%的训练延迟。

Conclusion: LoSiA是一种有效而高效的微调方法，适用于领域特化和常识推理任务，并能在持续训练中减少遗忘。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学应用等真实场景中的实验表明，NS方法在检测准确性和可解释性上均优于现有CAD方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了检测效率，还通过置信区间启用自适应的不确定性驱动决策过程，特别适用于如医疗健康领域。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Conclusion: DOTResize作为一种新的Transformer压缩方法，能够有效应对大型模型的计算冗余问题，同时兼顾性能和实际使用成本。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Motivation: 在线强化学习存在样本效率低的问题，这主要由于无法高效探索环境。大多数相关研究未充分利用专家示范和模拟器的潜力。

Method: 利用少量专家示范和支持任意状态重置的模拟器，基于适合的辅助初始状态分布进行训练，同时通过安全性的概念来指导分布选择。

Result: 提出的方法显著提升了样本效率，并在稀疏奖励且探索困难的环境中达到最先进效果。

Conclusion: 通过选用合适的辅助初始状态分布，结合安全性和专家示范信息，可以有效加速在线强化学习，尤其在稀疏奖励环境下表现卓越。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Result: Any4比现有4位数值表示（如int4、fp4、nf4）在多个模型（Llama 2、Llama 3、Mistral等）上获得更高准确性，同时与需要预处理的技术（如AWQ、GPTQ）具有竞争力。此外，引入tinygemm优化GPU性能。

Conclusion: Any4提供了一种无需权重与激活预处理的先进4位量化方案，不仅在低比特条件下具有竞争力，还能简化标定步骤，并通过开源推动社区发展。

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large
language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without
requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy
compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在物理领域的能力，并提出了一个新的基准ABench-Physics来评估其物理推理和概括能力，同时揭示当前模型的不足之处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学和编程领域表现出色，但在物理领域的能力仍未被深入研究和充分理解，因此需要一个专门的基准来测试它们在物理推理和建模方面的能力。

Method: 提出了ABench-Physics基准，包括两个组件：Phy_A是一个包含400道高难度静态问题的数据集；Phy_B是一个由100道问题组成的动态子集，提供自动变化引擎以测试模型的鲁棒性。所有问题要求严格的数值答案与格式要求。

Result: 通过评估多种最先进的LLMs，发现其在物理推理，特别是动态变体的泛化方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs科学推理能力提供了具有挑战性和诊断性的框架，标志着对这些模型在物理领域理解的重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为信息引导扩散采样（IGDS）的新方法，优化数据集蒸馏过程，特别是在低每类图像（IPC）情况下表现较佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在低IPC情况下生成数据缺乏多样性，亟需从信息论角度解决低IPC场景下的数据集精馏问题。

Method: 提出在扩散模型采样过程中最大化$I(X;Y) + \beta H(X|Y)$（其中$\beta$依赖于IPC），并通过变分估计的方法近似计算$I(X;Y)$和$H(X|Y)$。

Result: 实验表明，IGDS方法在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上的表现显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: IGDS方法通过考虑原型信息和上下文信息，改进扩散模型采样，从而有效提升数据集蒸馏的质量。代码将在论文接受后发布。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合多模态大语言模型(MLLM)的语义通信框架MLLM-SC，用于支持6G网络中要求很高的沉浸式通信体验，例如增强现实(AR)、虚拟现实(VR)和全息通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络面临高维多模态数据实时传输和智能处理的挑战。需要共同理解环境、上下文和用户意图来有效传递任务相关内容。

Method: 提出一种设备-边缘协同架构，其中边缘采用MLLM赋能的语义指导模块分析多模态输入、用户意图和信道条件，生成重要性感知的注意力图，用于优化语义编码器和解码器，实现资源自适应分配与高质量内容重建。

Result: 通过AR/VR可视化问答和基于扩散的图像生成案例研究，验证了MLLM-SC框架的有效性。

Conclusion: MLLM-SC系统能充分利用预训练模型的推理和生成能力，在上下文感知与任务导向的无线通信中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

*Sarthak Ketanbhai Modi,Zi Pong Lim,Yushi Cao,Yupeng Cheng,Yon Shin Teo,Shang-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为自组织正则化的自动编码器方法，可以动态调整特征空间的维度，从而优化压缩输入数据表示，同时减少计算资源和时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的超参数调节（如网格搜索）耗时费力且需要大量计算资源，因此需要一种高效的方法来优化自动编码器的隐藏层尺寸。

Method: 提出了一种受物理学概念启发的自组织稀疏自动编码器(SOSAE)，通过对特征向量的维度大小和位置索引进行惩罚，诱导特征空间的稀疏性，并动态裁剪非活跃部分达到无损压缩效果。

Result: 实验表明，SOSAE相比其他基线方法，在保持相同调整质量和性能的情况下，实现了最高130倍的浮点运算量(FLOPs)减少。

Conclusion: SOSAE能够高效自适应优化特征空间维度，为自动编码器的压缩表示提供了新的方向，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

*Hanzhang Jia,Yi Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出基于循环一致性的数据驱动训练框架，用以解决非单射回归任务中对先验知识和预设概率分布依赖过重的问题；实验结果显示其循环重建误差低于0.003，相较无循环一致性的基线模型，评估指标提升约30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多输出模型在非单射回归任务中严重依赖于预设概率分布和嵌入的先验知识，增加了手动设计规则的负担并降低了模型的通用性。

Method: 提出了一种基于循环一致性损失的数据驱动训练框架，同时优化正向模型\(\Phi:X \to Y\)和反向模型\(\Psi:Y \to X\)，通过最小化循环一致性损失实现生成与验证的闭环机制。

Result: 在归一化的合成和模拟数据集上的实验结果表明该方法实现了循环重建误差低于0.003，相比无循环一致性的基线模型在评估指标上有30%左右的提升。

Conclusion: 该框架支持无监督学习，显著减少对人工干预的依赖，在非单射回归任务中展现出潜在的优势。

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HAS-CGAN方法，通过数据增强提升超精密加工中的表面粗糙度预测精度，实验表明其显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于超精密加工中的小数据集限制了模型性能，因此需要开发一种有效的数据增强方法来提高表面粗糙度预测的准确性。

Method: 提出了Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss CGAN (HAS-CGAN) 方法，用于1D力信号的生成，并结合加工参数来改进预测精度。

Result: 通过傅里叶域优化，HAS-CGAN在高频信号生成中表现优异，实现了 >0.85 的小波相干性。实验表明，与传统数据集相比，使用520多个合成样本训练的模型将预测误差从31.4%降至约9%。

Conclusion: HAS-CGAN方法通过高质量的数据增强有效解决了超精密加工中表面粗糙度预测的数据不足问题。

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is
critical for real-time quality control, but small datasets hinder model
performance. We propose HAS-CGAN, a Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss CGAN, for
effective UPM data augmentation. Among five CGAN variants tested, HAS-CGAN
excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting
training data with 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4%
(original 52 samples) to ~9%, effectively addressing data scarcity in UPM
roughness prediction."

TL;DR: DANCE通过分布学习解决现有NAS方法适应性差、部署成本高及一致性差的问题，且在五个数据集上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS方法在现实应用中面临适应性和一致性挑战，且每次部署需高昂搜索成本。

Method: 引入连续架构分布、统一架构空间带选择门和多阶段训练策略，将架构搜索重新定义为连续进化问题。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明DANCE优于现有NAS方法，能够在低搜索成本下适应不同硬件需求并保持性能。

Conclusion: DANCE证明了动态架构进化方法的有效性，为NAS在实际中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs存在幻觉问题限制了其广泛应用，现有方法效率低，亟需新方法解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 作者提出SEED方法，通过模型内鉴别、隔离、净化幻觉知识，并利用净化后的知识对模型进行自我进化，同时引入模式寻求蒸馏法与幻觉消除适配器解决传统方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，SEED在多个基准上显著提高了代表性LVLM模型的性能。以LLaVA-1.5为例，其POPE-Random指标的F1从81.3提升至88.3。

Conclusion: SEED方法有效解决了LVLMs的幻觉问题，提升了模型的可信度和实用性，为相关技术的发展提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR)方法，通过缩减神经网络权重的增长，防止塑性丧失并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在训练中因权重无限增长导致的塑性丧失问题，同时避免用重初始化方法带来的信息损失和性能下降。

Method: 提出SWR方法，在每次学习过程中缩减权重大小，从而限制权重的无限增长并在层间平衡权重。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准上的多种学习任务（如热启动学习、连续学习、单任务学习）中表现提升。

Conclusion: SWR方法能有效解决权重无限增长带来的塑性丧失问题，提高性能且不丢失学习信息。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的神经网络层MJKAN，结合了KANs和MLPs的优势，旨在提升实际任务中的性能和计算效率并针对多项基准进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决KANs在计算成本和分类任务性能上的局限性，提出了一种能平衡理论优势与实际计算效率的新模型。

Method: 通过引入FiLM机制和RBF激活函数的组合，构建了一种混合架构MJKAN，同时兼顾了KANs的非线性表达能力和MLPs的计算效率。

Result: 在函数回归任务中，MJKAN具有卓越的近似能力，显著优于MLPs；在图像和文本分类任务中，表现接近MLPs，但性能依赖于基函数数量，需要针对任务复杂度调参以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN是一种灵活的模型，兼有KANs的理论优点和提高的计算效率，具备实用性，但需要合理调节容量以适应数据复杂性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Conclusion: 世界模型的主要目标是在现实世界中模拟所有可操作的可能性，从而促进具有目标性推理和操作的人工智能系统的发展。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上进行评估，方法在可解释性与样本效率方面优于基线。

Conclusion: CB-RM可在透明度、可审计性和人类对齐性方面推动奖励模型的进步。

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Motivation: 生成与特定主题密切相关的摘要仍然是语言模型的重大挑战，同时通过微调或提示工程存在局限性。

Method: 提出三种logits重权技术：常数移位（Constant Shift）、因子缩放（Factor Scaling）和阈值选择（Threshold Selection）。

Result: 实验表明三种方法有效提升了话题相关词的使用，阈值选择方法在提高主题聚焦的同时保证了摘要质量。

Conclusion: 直接调整logits的重权是一种资源高效且实用的替代方法，可精确控制生成文本的主题内容。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

TL;DR: 本论文提出UrbanMind框架，通过引入基于持续检索增强的专家模型语言模型（C-RAG-LLM），在动态复杂的城市环境中支持人工智能系统的推理和行动能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的城市环境中，现有AI系统缺乏长期适应性和复杂推理能力，提出UGI及其支持框架是为了解决这些问题。

Method: 采用工具增强的检索增强生成（RAG）框架C-RAG-LLM，结合多层次优化架构和增量语料更新机制，来提升城市AI系统的适应性和推理能力。

Result: 通过真实世界中多复杂性城市任务的评估验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来城市环境中的通用LLM智能体实现迈出了重要一步，展示了其适应动态变化环境的潜力。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Method: 通过一个玩具定位任务和卷积架构，分析规范化层在信息聚合中的角色，展示其如何实现迭代信息传递。

Result: 发现规范化层允许信息从局部感受野以外的区域进行聚合，具备迭代消息传递功能。

Conclusion: 在类似于基于扩散的轨迹生成等需要局部感受野的应用中，需谨慎使用规范化层，避免其带来的潜在问题。

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree
of communication across the spatial dimensions of an input tensor. We study a
toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

Conclusion: FedPall有效解决了联邦学习中特征漂移带来的性能下降问题，验证了所提出方法在提升分类准确性方面的优势。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过使用简单解释信号（如数据标签的重要输入特征），在小数据集上训练可靠分类模型的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小数据集的使用容易导致模型结果的变异性、过拟合以及学习错误关联，同时数据标签缺乏背后的推理逻辑使得模型难以理解标签分配的依据。

Method: 设计了一个两阶段的训练循环，交替提高模型预测准确性和校正其侧重，以使模型在学习过程中理解标签分配的逻辑。

Result: 验证了该训练循环能够加速模型收敛，特别是在小规模、不平衡以及存在错误特征的数据集上取得更精准且可靠的结果。

Conclusion: 利用简单解释信号指导学习，可以有效提升小数据集模型训练的可靠性与效果。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Conclusion: 提出了基于扩散轨迹分解的偏好优化方法，显著提升离散扩散模型的性能，包括在语言、DNA和蛋白质建模等领域的实际效果。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多模态图的冷启动节点分类时，对模型能力施加了限制，难以有效应对节点隔离和信息缺失问题。

Method: 提出了Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer)，通过自教范式同时预测节点的“学生”和“教师”输出，从而在不降级为MLP的情况下，自我指导模型学习。预先对多模态图进行一次处理，结合MoE输入投影与Transformer层实现数据融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，NTSFormer在公共数据集上的多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: NTSFormer能够克服现有方法的局限，全面利用Transformer的能力，显著改善冷启动节点分类性能。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

TL;DR: 探讨了深度强化学习（DRL）系统中的后门攻击问题，提出了两种新型攻击方法，并分析了其在更严格限制下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的DRL后门研究主要集中在需要训练阶段访问的攻击方式，这种方法对攻击者的权限要求较高且不现实，缺乏对整个DRL供应链漏洞的全面研究。

Method: 提出两种新型攻击方法：TrojanentRL，通过利用组件级漏洞进行后门植入，在模型完全重新训练后依旧存在；InfrectroRL，一种无需访问训练、验证或测试数据的后门攻击。

Result: 在六个Atari环境中的实验和分析表明，这两种攻击在更严格的对手权限下仍具备媲美现有训练时后门攻击的能力，且InfrectroRL能够规避当前主要的两种DRL后门防御方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了DRL系统中更为隐蔽且威胁深远的后门攻击方式，挑战了当前研究方向并凸显了开发强健防御机制的紧迫性。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Motivation: 研究动机源于语言模型在客户服务语音应用中需具备对话流畅性和特定风格要求，系统提示难以可靠实现。

Method: 通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)方法微调模型和对比不同系统提示方法表现，以合成Wikipedia数据集进行实验。

Result: 微调在对话语气调整上效果显著优于系统提示，且100样本下也能取得高表现，量化方法对收敛速度具有影响。

Conclusion: 微调开源小模型是一种高效且数据节约的方法，适合需要精细响应风格的实用场景，优于复杂的系统提示策略。

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Conclusion: 研究证明了对象中心去噪扩散模型在物理推理任务中的有效性，为复杂条件和实时操作的推理问题提供了潜在的新方法。

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际中，由于数据标注成本变动和预算限制，主动学习策略的采用会受到阻碍，因此需要开发适应这些限制的新策略。

Method: 提出了两种基于贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）的ConBatch-BAL策略：动态阈值策略和贪心选择策略；动态阈值策略通过重新分配预算完成采样，而贪心策略逐步选择样本，受现有预算限制。

Result: 在包含地理空间限制和高成本标注的真实场景数据集上，与随机采样相比，ConBatch-BAL策略展示了更少的学习迭代和成本优势，甚至优于无预算限制的基线方案。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在实际场景中表明了减少主动学习迭代、降低数据采集成本的有效性，同时具有超越传统基线方法的潜力。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Motivation: 旨在解决T细胞受体（TCR）序列稀疏性和目击率低的问题，从而改善自身免疫性疾病的临床应用。

Method: 结合PrimeSeq特征提取、ESMonehot编码和增强的门控注意力机制，开发了一种多实例深度学习框架EAMil。

Conclusion: EAMil提供了一个可解释的免疫受体分析框架，为自身免疫性疾病的检测和分类提供了新视角，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

Conclusion: 精心策划的数据集集合训练，提升了上下文学习的效能，同时具备模块化和替换性的优势。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Conclusion: 性能扩展规律不足以解释神经网络机制，应综合模型宽度对特征学习影响的分析来理解其运作。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend

### [665] [Distribution-dependent Generalization Bounds for Tuning Linear Regression Across Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05084)
*Maria-Florina Balcan,Saumya Goyal,Dravyansh Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究高维数据中的正则化超参数调优，提出了一种跨多个相关任务调整线性回归超参数方法，并对不同分布下的验证损失泛化误差建立了分布相关的界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高正则化超参数调优的效率与效果，避免模型过拟合，并保证有效的变量选择。

Method: 针对L1和L2系数（包括岭回归、lasso和弹性网回归等），对验证损失的泛化误差建立分布相关的界限，利用数据分布的一些假设来获得更紧的界限。

Result: 在假设任务内数据是从已知分布（如次高斯分布）独立同分布抽取的情况下，得到的泛化界限随特征维度的增加不会恶化，并在高维情况下显著优于以往工作。

Conclusion: 提出的分布相关界限在数据具有‘良好分布’性质时表现更优，为高维回归问题中的正则化参数调优提供理论支持。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于异构时空图模型的自监督方法，用于自动驾驶车辆(AVs)场景的高效测试，能够无监督地对场景进行分类和聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决自动驾驶车辆测试中如何高效选取一个有限且具有代表性的场景子集，尤其是捕捉“长尾”现象的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个灵活的异构时空图模型表示交通场景，并利用图神经网络(GNN)的进展，提出了一种自监督方法学习场景图的通用嵌入空间，通过对比学习和自举方法实现场景聚类和相似性搜索。

Result: 在nuPlan数据集上的实验验证了该模型的语义捕捉能力，可在无监督条件下有效地对场景进行聚类，不同的场景类型形成了明确的簇。

Conclusion: 本方法能够将变长度的交通场景浓缩为单一向量表示，无需人工标注或目标偏向性，支持基于模拟的可扩展场景选择，从而提升自动驾驶车辆的测试效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

TL;DR: 该研究发布了PRING，这是第一个从图的层面评估蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅注重孤立的二元交互评估，没有充分考虑构建生物学上有意义的蛋白质网络的重要性。该研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PRING基准，包括一个高质量、多物种的PPI网络数据集和两种互补评估方法：拓扑导向任务和功能导向任务，进行全面评估并进行实验验证。

Result: 当前的PPI模型在恢复PPI网络的结构和功能特性方面存在潜在局限性，无法很好地支持真实的生物学应用。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了一个可靠的平台，并为生物学研究中的相关应用提供支持。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法DICE，用于生成模拟随机过程的时间演化，解决了传统方法中的成本高和稳定性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法对时间条件高度依赖且训练过程不稳定，需多次采样。研究想要解决这些问题并提出更高效的方法。

Method: DICE通过定义专用损失函数来建模随机过程的演化，确保了训练的稳定性和鲁棒性，同时避免了频繁采样步骤。

Result: 实验验证了DICE在不同问题上的适用性和更低的计算成本，包括随机波、高维混沌等。

Conclusion: DICE方法提高了学习的效率和稳定性，是研究复杂动态系统的有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KFAC在深度学习中应用广泛，但其实现复杂且测试困难，这阻碍了研究者对其的进一步应用与扩展。作者希望提供一种更易于理解和实施的教程来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过结合数学公式与代码实现提供全面的教程，并依据最新文献整合测试用例，从而保证KFAC实现的可靠性。

Result: 该教程将KFAC的数学原理与编程实现并置，并引入现代测试用例，为初学者提供了深入理解和实践该方法的工具。

Conclusion: 该教程大幅度降低了KFAC的实施难度，为研究者和用户更好地理解、扩展和使用该方法提供了支持。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Motivation: 通过自动化参数提取和高质量拟合，克服传统方法对复杂模型准确性的局限性，推进晶体管设计与优化。

Conclusion: 该方法大幅提高了参数提取的效率和准确性，并促进了逆向设计领域的研究，其代码与数据集的公开也为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了如何在资源受限的TinyML硬件上实现神经符号AI（NSAI）的计算，提出了软硬件协同优化的方法，并通过对概率电路进行硬件高效的训练、压缩和部署显著提升了硬件性能和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服深度学习模型在不确定性量化和显式规则推理上的局限性，同时在嵌入式环境中支持神经符号AI的实现。

Method: 提出了一个整合硬件和软件的框架，具体包括：训练硬件高效的确定性概率电路、使用$n^{th}$-root压缩技术压缩模型以减少硬件计算资源需求，以及在TinyML硬件上部署压缩后的NSAI模型。

Result: 在FPGA上实现了多项硬件资源的显著节省（例如FF减少82.3%、LUT减少52.6%、Flash使用减少18.0%），且在ESP32微控制器上的推理速度提升了4.67倍。

Conclusion: 通过软硬件协同的优化策略，可以有效在资源受限的TinyML硬件上部署神经符号AI模型，解决了计算和存储的瓶颈，同时保持了较高的性能表现。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在分类、随机变量分布重建和从时空数据中学习动态系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多个不确定性量化场景中表现优秀，证明其能力和适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有的语言模型基准测试存在矛盾的模型排名问题，该研究提出通过在测试前进行统一微调（train-before-test）来解决这一问题，并实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试之间排名不一致导致模型选择困难、模型对比不清晰，并对快速增长的竞赛模型生态系统造成困扰，需要一个方法来缓解不同模型在测试任务准备程度的差异。

Method: 提出了train-before-test方法，即在评估前对每个模型进行一致的基准特定微调，并在24个基准和61个模型上进行广泛的实证评估。

Result: train-before-test方法显著提高了排名一致性，极大地改善了排名的外部有效性，减少模型间的排名分歧，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因子。

Conclusion: 建议将train-before-test方法作为大型语言模型基准测试评估的默认流程。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ADS的焦点是从预测模型中学习模式并应用于问题解决，但实际应用中其往往成为一种整体的政策干预工具。

Method: 提出了一种从预测转向干预的ADS问题框架，强调预测应配合决策支持一起纳入全面考量，用现代统计框架和工具统一设计、应用和评估方法。

Result: 揭示了ADS以预测任务为焦点的局限性，并提出了推进干预导向ADS研究的具体方向。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义ADS开发思路，促使其兼顾预测模型与决策干预，为社会系统的实际价值带来推动。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

Motivation: 解决当前混合推断工具在估算范围上的受限问题，并服务于经济、社会、教育等领域下的关键指标计算。

Method: 提出名为QuEst的框架，结合高保真观测数据与大量推断输出数据，进行分布度量；并扩展到多维度指标，并通过优化技术进一步降低估算方差。

Result: 通过经济建模、舆论调查和语言模型自评实验，证明QuEst框架效果显著。

Conclusion: QuEst是一个可提供改进分位数度量估算与置信区间的工具，可适用于重要领域的实际应用。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

TL;DR: 随着LLMs参数规模的增长，越来越多的推理任务依赖第三方，而这带来了用户数据隐私问题。本文提出了新的推理协议Cascade，通过序列维度的分片避免高昂成本，在保证隐私的同时提升性能与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型不断增长，其运行所需的计算资源变得更加集中化，依赖第三方推理服务，这威胁用户数据隐私。现有安全计算方案如SMPC尽管提供了隐私保障，但成本过高且难以扩展到大模型上。

Method: 提出Cascade协议，通过序列维度分片避免密钥计算成本，在牺牲部分密码学隐私保障的情况下换取性能和可扩展性。

Result: Cascade展示了对攻击的抗性，包括对现有统计隐私方案的攻击扩展版及基于学习的攻击，同时性能大幅优于现有方案。

Conclusion: Cascade协议为现代最先进语言模型的安全部署提供了实用性解决方案，在隐私保护和性能间找到了有效平衡。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GWAS难以捕捉非线性遗传交互，而现有深度学习方法存在特征选择约束，或者面临全数据集应用时的数据泄露问题。同时，协变量可能会夸大预测性能，混淆真实遗传信号。研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 研究通过优化深度学习架构，在无数据泄露条件下改进GWAS方法，并扩展到多标签框架以联合建模五种疾病。

Result: 在37000个样本中应用五百万SNP位点的分析，方法的预测性能（AUC在0.68至0.96之间）具有竞争力，且具有可扩展性和生物学意义。

Conclusion: 新提出的深度学习方法为多疾病GWAS分析提供了一个无泄漏、高效且生物学上有意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

Result: 实验证明，相较现有算法，LLM-SAEA在标准测试用例中取得更优表现。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA实现了自动化配置优化，证明大语言模型在此领域的强大潜力。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出SESLR算法，通过睡眠增强隐存回放机制与尖峰神经网络（SNNs）结合，显著减少边缘计算中的内存占用并缓解分类偏差，实现高效的在线连续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线连续学习算法在边缘计算场景中存储需求高且对新任务有偏向，需要一种兼顾内存效率与准确性的解决方案。

Method: SESLR通过结合尖峰神经网络的二进制尖峰特性，以及模拟生物睡眠—清醒循环的噪声增强睡眠阶段，用单比特存储回放特征并注入噪声缓解分类偏差。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10等常规数据集和NMNIST、CIFAR10-DVS等神经形态数据集上进行了实验：在Split CIFAR10中平均准确率提升近30%，内存消耗减至原方法的1/3；在Split CIFAR10-DVS中准确率提升约10%，内存减少32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR在资源有限的在线连续学习场景中展现了显著性能与内存优势，是一种极具潜力的解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

Motivation: 传统神经网络训练需要大量计算资源和时间，研究希望探索通过替代方法更高效地初始化神经网络权重和阈值。

Method: 利用Builder C++环境模拟静电场，将模拟场的势值用作神经网络第一层神经元权值，实现基于势值的无计算训练神经网络。

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds
of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic
field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training
algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric
recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic
field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated
system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial
conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional
viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can
obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field,
without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or
massive training datasets.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPEAR的新框架，通过强化学习直接使用SynOps作为约束，解决了传统方法中搜索过程与SynOps约束不匹配的问题，显著提高了SNN在资源受限硬件上的适配性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动深度脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在资源受限的神经形态硬件上的部署，解决因SynOps约束动态变化而导致现有搜索方法无法准确满足目标的问题。

Method: 引入SPEAR框架，采用强化学习技术直接将SynOps作为搜索约束，并提出一个名为LRE的SynOps预测机制以及一个名为TAR的新型奖励机制，用于提高搜索过程的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，SPEAR能有效地在特定SynOps约束条件下对SNN进行压缩并提高其硬件适配性。

Conclusion: SPEAR框架通过精确预测SynOps并利用强化学习的创新奖励机制，显著缓解资源受限环境下深度SNN部署的挑战，为进一步优化提供了可能性。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不应期机制依赖经验分布或尖峰放电率，在低延迟尖峰神经网络中效果较差，而不使用不应期又会导致神经元过度激活和系统抗噪性下降。

Method: 提出HDRP模型结合膜电位导数与历史不应期时间动态调整初始不应期长度，并通过阈值依赖的不应期核缓解神经元状态积累问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余尖峰，在静态数据集与神经形态数据集上取得SOTA精度，并在抗噪性上超越传统SNN和ANN。

Conclusion: HDRP机制在提升低延迟尖峰神经网络的性能方面发挥了关键作用，既保留了二值化特性，又增强了鲁棒性和抗干扰能力。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Motivation: 探索由LLM驱动的算法生成方法在黑盒优化问题上的性能，并通过分析行为动态揭示影响算法表现的关键因素。

Method: 采用LLaMEA框架和GPT o4-mini模型，通过六种变异提示策略生成并优化不同的算法，评估它们在BBOB基准测试套件上的表现，同时记录搜索行为的动态行为数据进行多维度分析。

Result: 发现加入简化代码提示和随机扰动提示的1+1精英进化策略变体表现最佳，并揭示更高性能算法表现出更强的开发习性、快速收敛和较少的停滞。

Conclusion: 行为空间的分析能够解释LLM生成的启发式算法表现差异，并为未来自适应LLM驱动的算法生成器设计提供指导和优化方向。

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms
automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery
methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework
with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation
heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA
variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and
analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration,
exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse
these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis
combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features,
performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks.
The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm
structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both
a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist
evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over
the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that
higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and
faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how
behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics
outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the
open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide
insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm
generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAES-25源于二十多年前电信问题的研究，旨在探索MOEAs在多目标适应度上的局部搜索动态性。

Method: 通过数学推导，分析了PAES-25在m-LOTZ问题上的预期运行时间，详细讨论了不同目标数量(m值)情况下的时间复杂度，并对优化器进行了比较。

Result: 当m≥4时，PAES-25比现有的(G)SEMO表现更优，其运行时间复杂度首次得到了紧的数学界限；此外，提出的归档机制能够有效分布解集。

Conclusion: PAES-25在某些多目标问题上具优势，但在具体基准(如OMM或COCZ)上仍存在局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a first mathematical runtime analysis of PAES-25, an
enhanced version of the original Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES)
coming from the study of telecommunication problems over two decades ago to
understand the dynamics of local search of MOEAs on many-objective fitness
landscapes. We derive tight expected runtime bounds of PAES-25 with one-bit
mutation on $m$-LOTZ until the entire Pareto front is found: $\Theta(n^3)$
iterations if $m=2$, $\Theta(n^3 \log^2(n))$ iterations if $m=4$ and
$\Theta(n(2n/m)^{m/2} \log(n/m))$ iterations if $m>4$ where $n$ is the problem
size and $m$ the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the first known tight runtime bounds for an MOEA outperforming the best known
upper bound of $O(n^{m+1})$ for (G)SEMO on $m$-LOTZ when $m$ is at least $4$.
We also show that archivers, such as the Adaptive Grid Archiver (AGA),
Hypervolume Archiver (HVA) or Multi-Level Grid Archiver (MGA), help to
distribute the set of solutions across the Pareto front of $m$-LOTZ
efficiently. We also show that PAES-25 with standard bit mutation optimizes the
bi-objective LOTZ benchmark in expected $O(n^4)$ iterations, and we discuss its
limitations on other benchmarks such as OMM or COCZ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决符号回归中精度与可解释性平衡的问题，并探讨改进模块化GP-GOMEA算法。

Method: 通过引入多目标与单目标优化，并提出新目标以提升模块化GP-GOMEA性能。

Result: 单目标方法在平均超体积表现上优于多目标，并分析了其适用场景。

Conclusion: 单目标与多目标方法各有优势，需根据具体需求选择合适的方法，同时提出了进一步提升算法的方向。

Abstract: In Symbolic Regression (SR), achieving a proper balance between accuracy and
interpretability remains a key challenge. The Genetic Programming variant of
the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GP-GOMEA) is of particular
interest as it achieves state-of-the-art performance using a template that
limits the size of expressions. A recently introduced expansion, modular
GP-GOMEA, is capable of decomposing expressions using multiple subexpressions,
further increasing chances of interpretability. However, modular GP-GOMEA may
create larger expressions, increasing the need to balance size and accuracy. A
multi-objective variant of GP-GOMEA exists, which can be used, for instance, to
optimize for size and accuracy simultaneously, discovering their trade-off.
However, even with enhancements that we propose in this paper to improve the
performance of multi-objective modular GP-GOMEA, when optimizing for size and
accuracy, the single-objective version in which a multi-objective archive is
used only for logging, still consistently finds a better average hypervolume.
We consequently analyze when a single-objective approach should be preferred.
Additionally, we explore an objective that stimulates re-use in multi-objective
modular GP-GOMEA.

TL;DR: 本文提出NSGA-III-UR算法，通过必要时更新参考向量来平衡性能和复杂性，比传统NSGA-III及A-NSGA-III表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSGA-III算法在解决不规则Pareto前沿问题时表现欠佳，为此提出了改进方案以提升其适应性。

Method: 设计了一种混合算法NSGA-III-UR，根据Pareto前沿的规则性有选择地激活参考向量的动态调整。

Result: 在DTLZ1-7, IDTLZ1-2基准测试集及实际问题中，NSGA-III-UR显著优于NSGA-III和A-NSGA-III。

Conclusion: NSGA-III-UR有效提升了在不规则前沿场景中的性能，并在标准参考点机制下保持相对简单性。

Abstract: The NSGA-III algorithm relies on uniformly distributed reference points to
promote diversity in many-objective optimization problems. However, this
strategy may underperform when facing irregular Pareto fronts, where certain
vectors remain unassociated with any optimal solutions. While adaptive schemes
such as A-NSGA-III address this issue by dynamically modifying reference
points, they may introduce unnecessary complexity in regular scenarios. This
paper proposes NSGA-III with Update when Required (NSGA-III-UR), a hybrid
algorithm that selectively activates reference vector adaptation based on the
estimated regularity of the Pareto front. Experimental results on benchmark
suites (DTLZ1-7, IDTLZ1-2) and real-world problems demonstrate that NSGA-III-UR
consistently outperforms NSGA-III and A-NSGA-III across diverse problem
landscapes.

Conclusion: 自适应的单位循环为符号与连续序列建模提供了强大的归纳偏差，同时确保了解决长序列处理问题的有效性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for
long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to
represent formal languages particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued
recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and
structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the
Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that
leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary
evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove
that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at
finite precision, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages
that are out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical
inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution
formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training.
Empirically, we show that AUSSM when interleaved with Mamba outperform prior
SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and
achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a
powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence
modeling.
