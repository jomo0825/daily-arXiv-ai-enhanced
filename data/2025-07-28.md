### [4] [Adapt, But Don't Forget: Fine-Tuning and Contrastive Routing for Lane Detection under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18653)
*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过固定源分支以避免灾难性遗忘，并通过分支和组件选择进行高效的参数调整和动态分配来实现跨数据集的车道检测模型优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前车道检测模型在跨数据集分布变化时易发生灾难性遗忘问题，因此需要新的方法支持高效适配。

Method: 训练基础模型，对目标分布通过创建独立分支及组件逐步调整，并利用监督对比学习模型在推断时动态路由输入分布到相应分支。

Result: 该框架在F1得分上接近最优，同时参数使用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 通过分支策略和动态分配，可以有效减少每个分布的训练参数量并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

### [5] [Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655)
*James Dickens,Kamyar Hamad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将点云深度学习和人体解析结合的新方法，通过生成伪真值标注并引入新采样策略，实现了大规模人体网格的语义分割。

Result: 实验结果证实了方法的有效性和准确性，表明可用于大规模人体网格的语义分割任务。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种无需依赖纹理信息的纯几何语义分割方法，为点云学习和人体解析的结合开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

### [6] [ShrinkBox: Backdoor Attack on Object Detection to Disrupt Collision Avoidance in Machine Learning-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18656)
*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种叫ShrinkBox的后门攻击，针对ADAS中的目标检测系统，使得目标框被缩小，导致距离估计误差显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ADAS通过探测和警告功能提升了安全性，但高昂的传感器成本限制了其普及性，因此基于深度学习的低成本ML-ADAS成为一种解决方案。然而，其目标检测系统存在安全漏洞急需应对。

Method: 提出ShrinkBox后门攻击，它通过在基准数据集中实施微妙的标签篡改，使边界框缩小，同时在对抗训练时保持隐蔽性。这种攻击在YOLOv9m模型中以4%的训练数据中毒率实现。

Result: 证明ShrinkBox在目标检测攻击中的成功率达96%，并导致距离估计误差（MAE）增加3倍以上，有效地干扰ADAS的碰撞预警功能。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻破了当前ML-ADAS的关键功能安全性，揭示了在目标检测安全方面需要采取更有效的防御措施。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

### [7] [VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657)
*Zehui Zhao,Laith Alzubaidi,Haider A. Alwzwazy,Jinglan Zhang,Yuantong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VGS-ATD的新型分布式学习框架，在30个数据集和80个独立标签的实验中以92.7%的准确率优于传统的集中式学习和其他分布式学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统集中式学习方法的隐私风险以及现有分布式学习方法在异构和不平衡数据下的表现不佳、效率低下以及灾难性遗忘等问题。

Method: 利用VGS-ATD分布式学习框架，通过多个节点共享模型权重而非原始数据，克服了传统模型的多种局限性，并在不同类别标签和数据分布环境下进行验证。

Result: VGS-ATD在实验中表现出92.7%的准确率，大幅优于集中式学习（84.9%）和其他分布式学习方法，并表现出强大的扩展性和抗灾难性遗忘能力，同时降低了计算成本最多50%。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD高效且可扩展，不仅在实际应用中增强了训练性能，还显著减少了计算开销，适合动态复杂医疗环境中的持续学习需求。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

### [9] [Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661)
*Ruixing Zhang,Yang Zhang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种将视觉语言模型（VLM）用于人类轨迹预测的创新方法，通过结合地图与轨迹数据进行类人推理，实现了在多个城市数据集上的最新技术表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在预测下一位置时通常通过视觉化轨迹并基于道路连接性和移动趋势进行推理，但现有模型大多未能模拟这种类人的推理过程。

Method: 提出了一种名为Vision-Guided Location Search（VGLS）的方法以初步验证VLM能否进行轨迹推理，然后开发了两阶段的VLMLocPredictor，包括通过监督微调任务获取道路与轨迹推理能力，以及通过视觉地图反馈的强化学习自我提升预测能力。

Result: 在四个不同城市数据集上取得了最新的技术表现，且相比其他基于LLM的方法，展现了更优的跨城市泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合视觉语言模型与道路网络的模式认知可以显著提升轨迹预测性能，并实现了类人推理方式的初步建模，证明该方法的有效性与广泛适用性。

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过多模态融合提高嫌疑人素描的自动化和质量。

Method: 开发了三种管道：(1) 基本图像-图像稳定扩散模型；(2) 集成预训练CLIP模型的稳定扩散模型；(3) 结合 LoRA 微调CLIP模型并与稳定扩散模型集成的新方法。

Result: 模型1在结构相似性(SSIM)和峰值信噪比(PSNR)方面均表现最佳，分别为0.72和25 dB。尽管模型3在感知相似性（LPIPS）上优于模型2，但模型1仍在整体性能上领先。

Conclusion: 简约的基准模型表现优越，其生成的素描在人脸特征上最清晰，展示了其鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

*Sanyam Jain,Marsha Mariya Kappan,Vijeta Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了CLIP模型在动作识别中的表现，并提出了使用自定义损失函数生成类别特定噪声的方法来改进模型准确性和减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动作识别在医疗保健和医学中具有重要作用，但现有的传统模型如CNNs和RNNs难以处理复杂和多样化的动作，因而需要更具泛化能力的方法。

Method: 通过对CLIP模型在UCF-101数据集上的性能进行评估，探索了三种屏蔽策略：基于比例与形状的遮罩、特定特征遮罩以及保留类别特定区域的隔离遮罩；并提出结合自定义损失函数用于生成类别特定噪声的改进方法。

Result: 研究发现，CLIP在视觉线索被遮蔽时表现出不一致性和错误分类，但通过提出的改进方法，模型的分类准确性与信心均有显著提升，同时减少了偏差。

Conclusion: 通过增强模型对类别定义特征的注意力，新方法有效改善了CLIP在动作识别任务中的表现，但其在医疗领域中的实际应用仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究以提升领域独立性的泛化能力。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

### [12] [HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18677)
*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HeartUnloadNet，一个基于深度学习的框架，用于直接从心室舒张末期的网格预测卸载后的心室几何形状，同时结合生物物理先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏的卸载几何形状是个体化生物力学建模的关键，但通过临床图像估计这一几何形状仍是一个挑战。传统方法依赖高计算成本的逆有限元求解器。

Method: 提出一种深度学习框架HeartUnloadNet，采用图注意力架构，结合循环一致性策略，可输入任意大小的网格和生理参数，输出卸载后的心室网格。

Result: 在20,700个有限元模拟数据上测试，HeartUnloadNet精度达到子毫米水平，平均DSC为0.986，HD为0.083 cm，推理时间仅需0.02秒，较传统方法快10^5倍且更准确。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet提供了一种可扩展且精确的逆有限元求解器替代方案，支持未来的实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据的稀缺性限制了空间智能的发展，亟需一种高效生成大规模3D数据的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为发展能够感知、理解和交互真实环境的AI系统提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

### [14] [SaLF: Sparse Local Fields for Multi-Sensor Rendering in Real-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18713)
*Yun Chen,Matthew Haines,Jingkang Wang,Krzysztof Baron-Lis,Sivabalan Manivasagam,Ze Yang,Raquel Urtasun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Sparse Local Fields (SaLF)的新型体积表示方法，支持快速训练和渲染，同时支持摄像头和LiDAR等多种传感器的高效和真实模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高保真传感器模拟方法存在训练和渲染速度慢，以及传感器兼容性不佳的问题，限制了自动驾驶技术的规模化测试。

Method: 提出了一种名为SaLF的稀疏局部体积表示方法，利用稀疏3D体素网格，其中每个体素是一个局部隐式场，支持光栅化和光线追踪。

Result: SaLF实现了快速训练（<30分钟）和渲染（摄像头50+FPS，LiDAR 600+FPS），并支持自适应修剪和加密，适用于大型场景，以及非针孔摄像头和旋转LiDAR等多类型传感器。

Conclusion: SaLF提供了与当前方法相当的现实感，同时在效率和功能上有所提升，促进了自动驾驶仿真测试的规模化发展。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 本文的方法在面向单目相机输入的可行驶走廊预测中表现出色，标志着基于轮廓的扩散模型的潜力。

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 利用面部特征标志检测深度伪造，通过分析面部运动的不一致性替代直接图像处理，取得高效检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术的真实性问题日益严峻，需要新的检测方法来识别由人工智能生成的媒体内容。

Method: 提出基于面部特征标志的深度伪造检测方法，通过提取面部标志并分析运动的不一致性，而非直接处理图像数据。

Result: 实验显示该方法在RNN和ANN模型中分别达到96%和93%的准确率，而CNN模型约为78%。

Conclusion: 新方法表明无需依赖图像处理，仅采用面部特征提取即可实现高精度深度伪造检测，参数需求更少且适用于多种神经网络模型。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a

modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Conclusion: PTCMIL创新性地结合提示令牌与聚类技术，提供了一种高效且任务匹配度高的MIL方法，为全切片图像分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语音识别因无声音信息和易混淆的唇形而面临高错误率和高数据需求的挑战。

Method: 提出基于音素的两阶段框架：第一阶段融合视觉和面部标志特征预测音素，第二阶段使用编码器-解码器LLM模型将音素重建为单词。

Result: PV-ASR方法在LRS2数据集获得17.4%的WER，在LRS3数据集获得21.0%的WER，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过音素预测和LLM重建有效解决了现有方法的挑战，提高了V-ASR的准确性。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Conclusion: MAT-Adv通过对点云的中轴变换进行显式扰动，成功增强了对抗样本的迁移性和对抗防御机制下的性能，展示了其在3D深度学习模型鲁棒性研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 引入3D几何先验的自监督方法能够有效弥合模态差距，提高定位成功率，为平面图定位提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

Conclusion: CSRDA能够有效缓解数据和手工标注不足的问题，推动了S2R-COD领域的发展，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为WiSE-OD的红外图像目标检测方法，结合了RGB图像与红外图像模型的权重，提升了模型的跨模态与分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外目标检测依赖于RGB预训练权重，虽经微调能提升精度，但因RGB与红外模态间的差异，微调会削弱分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种跨模态分布偏移基准（LLVIP-C和FLIR-C）并设计一个名为WiSE-OD的权重空间融合方法，分为WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$两个变体。

Result: WiSE-OD在不同RGB预训练检测器和两个鲁棒基准上的实验表明，无需额外训练或推断成本，依然显著提升了跨模态和抗腐蚀鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了红外目标检测中的模态差异问题，为跨模态任务的鲁棒性提升提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新颖的多粒度分层融合Transformer方法（MGHFT），以解决表情包情感识别的挑战，显著提高了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉模型在提取视觉特征方面表现出色，但由于表情包情感理解需要多视角信息（如背景知识和风格线索），该领域仍面临较大挑战。

Method: 论文提出采用多模态大语言模型（Multimodal Large Language Models）提供丰富的文本上下文，通过多视角描述来解释表情包情感；然后设计分层融合策略将文本上下文融入视觉理解中。基于金字塔视觉Transformers提取全局和局部特征，并通过对比学习和注意力机制在视觉骨干网的不同阶段注入文本特征，最后通过文本引导融合注意机制有效整合多模态特征。

Result: MGHFT在2个公开表情包情感数据集上的实验表明，与现有方法相比，该方法的情感识别准确率和细粒度情感识别显著提升，F1提高5.4%，准确率提高4.0%。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过创新性的多模态融合方法成功解决了表情包情感理解中的挑战，为这一领域提供了一种有效的解决方案，并显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的点分布转换框架PDT，用于将点云从几何分布转换为语义上有意义的目标分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何从无结构点云中提取有意义的结构信息并转换为语义上有意义的点分布的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的新颖架构和学习策略，通过去噪过程关联源点和目标分布，实现点云分布转换。

Result: 成功将输入点云转换成具有结构化的输出形态，如表面对齐关键点、内部稀疏关节和连续特征线。

Conclusion: PDT框架能够捕获几何和语义特征，成为各种需要结构化点分布的3D几何处理任务的强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection
capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.

Result: 在挑战性基准上取得了较好结果，例如DAVIS-17验证集上的F值为91.6（相对方法为89.7），YouTubeVOS 2019验证集上的G值为86.6（相对方法为86.2），推理速度达48 FPS。

Conclusion: 方法在精度和效率上均优于当前最先进方法，适用于实时需求。

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive

Conclusion: PerioDet方法及PerioXrays数据集推进了自动化根尖周炎检测的发展，并具有实际的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Motivation: 混合模态搜索在实际应用中重要但尚未被深入研究，需要在异构数据（图像、文本及多模态文档）中高效搜索。

Method: 提出了一种后处理校正方法GR-CLIP，通过减少CLIP嵌入空间的模态间差距，改善其在混合模态搜索任务中的表现。

Result: 在混合模态搜索专用基准MixBench上，GR-CLIP将NDCG@10提升了最多26个百分点，并在计算量显著减少的情况下超过了最近的生成型嵌入模型表现。

Conclusion: GR-CLIP显著改进了CLIP在混合模态搜索中的性能，是一种高效轻量的后处理校正方法。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

Result: 与八个主流潜变量扩散模型的实验表明，AEDR相比现有方法归属准确性提高25.5%，计算时间减少99%。

Conclusion: AEDR实现了高效、准确的生成图像归属，能有效缓解生成模型的潜在安全问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在图像描述评估中存在不足，需要一个更全面和用户导向的评估标准。

Method: 提出了LOTUS排行榜，用于评估各种图像描述质量，包括描述准确性、社会偏见等，同时允许根据不同用户偏好调整评估标准。

Result: 分析显示，目前没有单一模型能在所有评估标准中表现最佳，描述详尽性与偏见风险之间存在相关性。用户偏好导向的评估显示，最佳模型选择取决于用户的优先级。

Conclusion: LOTUS为图像描述评估提供了一个新的综合性框架，可以依据用户需求改善模型选择。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

Conclusion: 所提出的统一点级提示方法提供了一种参数高效的点云分析新途径，为处理低质量点云问题提供了创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像数据的低对比度与稀疏纹理使得现有模型难以有效地保持全局一致性，此问题迫切需要更加鲁棒的长距离依赖建模方式。

Method: 提出了GPSMamba框架，通过自适应语义频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）注入非局部上下文语义频率提示，同时结合热谱注意力机制与相位一致性损失，加强全局结构和光谱一致性，弥补传统一维因果扫描方式的不足。

Conclusion: GPSMamba提供了一种新颖的基于非因果监督与状态空间模型相结合的策略，为红外图像超分辨率问题的解决提供了新的方向和潜力。同时，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一种名为MMBench-GUI的分层基准测试系统，用于评估跨平台GUI自动化代理的能力，同时提出了EQA效率评估指标，结果表明视觉定位和任务效率是关键研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出了一种评估跨Windows、macOS、Linux、iOS、Android和Web平台GUI自动化代理的通用基准，同时解决当前任务效率研究不足的问题。

Method: 设计了四个层次的测试（GUI内容理解、元素定位、任务自动化、任务协作），并引入EQA指标评估执行效率，同时分析不同模块框架对任务性能的影响。

Result: 发现准确的视觉定位是任务成功的决定性因素，跨平台功能和任务规划能力至关重要；现有模型在任务效率上普遍存在大量冗余步骤问题。

Conclusion: 高效的GUI自动化需要精确定位、有效规划与提前停止策略的结合，整合这些能力才能实现真正高效和可扩展的自动化应用。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at
https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.

*Ying Ba,Tianyu Zhang,Yalong Bai,Wenyi Mo,Tao Liang,Bing Su,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的评价图像生成系统的评分方法ICT与HP，且改进了现有评估准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成评估框架无法满足高忠实度和高级美学图像的需求，与人类审美偏好存在偏离。

Method: 设计了ICT评分以评估图像载有的文本信息，并基于该评分模型训练了HP评分模型，仅利用图像模态提升审美质量及文本对齐度。

Result: 实验结果显示新方法评分准确率比现有方法提高了10%以上，在优化文本到图像生成模型中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为提升图像生成技术以符合高级人类美学偏好提供了理论与实践支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSymmFlow在医疗影像分类和不确定性估计中表现优异，是一种结合生成与判别的方法，评估结果显示其在准确率及AUC方面优于现有模型，同时提供了可靠的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗影像分类模型在高风险临床环境下需要准确预测和校准的不确定性估计。该研究设计了一种统一分类、生成和不确定性量化的模型，旨在解决这一需求。

Method: 提出并建立了MedSymmFlow模型，这是一种基于对称流匹配的生成判别混合模型，并采用了潜在空间形式与语义掩码条件机制，从而提高输入扩展性及诊断相关性。同时，它通过生成采样过程自然估计不确定性。

Result: 在四个MedMNIST数据集上进行了评估，涵盖各种模态和病理，实验表明MedSymmFlow在分类精度和AUC上达到或超过主流基线模型，同时提供了可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow模型在高分辨率医疗影像的分类和不确定性估计上实现了可靠性和高性能，适用于高风险临床环境。

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理图文交互任务时，尽管表现出色，但常因生成内容与输入或事实知识相悖而出现幻觉问题，这需要被系统地理解和解决。

Method: 提出幻觉的信实性和真实性分类法，综述了现有幻觉评估基准的构建、目标与指标，并总结了实例级幻觉检测方法，最后揭示了当前工作的局限性并展望未来方向。

Conclusion: 基于现有研究的分析，提出了改进方向，为更精准地处理多模态任务中的幻觉并提升模型性能奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

*Yanghong Liu,Xingping Dong,Ming Li,Weixing Zhang,Yidong Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的行人轨迹预测框架PatchTraj,利用时间和频率的交互提升预测精度，实验结果优于当前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡局部运动细节和长范围时空依赖性以及时间表示与频率域交互方面存在不足。

Method: 通过将轨迹分解为时间和频率两部分，使用动态补丁分区和跨模态注意力机制融合时间和频率特征，最终通过Transformer预测轨迹。

Result: PatchTraj在ETH-UCY、SDD、NBA和JRDB四个数据集上达到了最新的性能且算法效率高。

Conclusion: PatchTraj框架通过创新性的时间域和频率域交互方法，有效提升了行人轨迹预测的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

### [47] [A New One-Shot Federated Learning Framework for Medical Imaging Classification with Feature-Guided Rectified Flow and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19045)
*Yufei Ma,Hanwen Zhang,Qiya Yang,Guibo Luo,Yuesheng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的OSFL框架，通过FG-RF模型和DLKD聚合方法在非IID数据下实现了更高效和隐私安全的联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成模型的OSFL方法在医疗领域存在训练效率低和隐私泄露风险；此外，在非IID数据下很难在单轮模型聚合中实现收敛。

Method: 提出了一种新的特征引导校正流模型（FG-RF），在客户端通过特征级别生成图像以加速生成建模并保护隐私；此外，设计了双层知识蒸馏（DLKD）聚合方法，在聚合过程中使全球学生模型同时模仿客户端教师模型的输出激活值和中间层特征。

Result: 在三个非IID医疗影像数据集上的实验表明，该框架和方法优于多轮联邦学习方法，性能提升高达21.73%，且相比FedISCA基线平均提高21.75%。同时，特征层合成图像显著降低了隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 改进的OSFL框架在提升训练效率和降低隐私泄漏方面表现优越，尤其适用于医疗领域的非IID数据情境。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 脑编码模型利用先进的视觉和听觉特征提取器，在分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）数据中评估其性能，发现模型复杂性和泛化能力之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决在面对真实新颖情境下，脑活动编码模型的泛化能力这一关键性问题。

Method: 采用X-CLIP视觉特征提取器和Whisper听觉特征提取器，开发并通过ID与OOD数据评估脑编码模型的性能。

Result: 较高容量的注意力模型在ID数据上表现较好，但较简单的线性模型在OOD数据上表现更为强健，提高了18%的性能；语言特征对于熟悉语言的预测无显著帮助，高保真语音特征在听觉皮层中提升了表现。

Conclusion: 测试表明，分布外数据评估对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型结构、刺激特性和感官层次对多模态世界的神经编码有显著影响。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决3D场景生成中语义漂移问题的新方法ScenePainter，能够产生一致且沉浸的3D视图序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D视图序列时容易出现语义漂移、累积偏差等问题，降低了生成场景的连贯性和沉浸感。

Method: 提出ScenePainter框架，利用层次化的场景概念图(SceneConceptGraph)建立多层次场景概念的关系，引导出图模块生成一致性的新视图，并通过动态优化提高多样性。

Result: 实验表明新方法有效解决语义漂移问题，生成的3D视图序列更加连贯且富有沉浸感。

Conclusion: ScenePainter框架在长距离3D场景生成领域中表现出色，为视频生成和场景重构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

*Xiaocheng Fang,Jieyi Cai,Huanyu Liu,Wenxiu Cai,Yishu Liu,Bingzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种名为噪声弹性查询优化（NRQO）的新方法，通过结合噪声容忍特征金字塔网络（NT-FPN）和成对相似度区域建议网络（PS-RPN），增强小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformers的检测器在小目标检测任务上仍因特征金字塔网络(FPN)的噪声敏感性以及标签分配策略中的查询质量较低而表现欠佳。

Method: NRQO包含两部分：一是NT-FPN减轻FPN噪声影响，保持空间和语义信息；二是PS-RPN通过位置和形状相似性优化锚点与真实值匹配，生成更多高质量正样本查询，无需额外超参数。

Result: 大量基准数据上的实验表明，与最先进的方法相比，NRQO表现更优越。

Conclusion: NRQO通过改进特征融合和标签分配策略，有效提升小目标检测性能，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Haochen Han,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Fangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了视觉语言模型中否定理解的问题，提出了一种高效的测试时自适应方法（NEAT）来应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在理解否定时的不足，尤其在需要明确识别假信息或不存在事物的实际应用中。

Method: 提出了否定感知测试时自适应方法（NEAT），通过调整分布相关参数，减少分布偏移，并消除语义不相关的虚假一致性。

Result: 在多个否定理解任务上进行了大量实验，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT方法无需大量训练数据与计算资源，是解决否定理解问题的高效可持续方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有利用预训练生成模型的图像解码方法在跨受试者映射时表现不佳，由于认知差异和个体特性，单向映射会导致序列误差，影响重构效果。

Method: 提出了双向自编码器交织框架，通过受试者偏差调节模块实现多个受试者的统一映射，并结合语义优化模块及视觉一致性模块，提升解码精度和视觉/语义表现。该方法整合ControlNet和Stable Diffusion模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的定性和定量评估中，该方法优于现有最先进方法，并展现了对新受试者的快速适应能力。

Conclusion: 此方法成功提升了fMRI信号解码的精度、适应性及语义一致性，具有很好的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Method: 提出了一种三流架构的MuStD网络，分别从LiDAR提取2D柱状特征、BEV特征，并通过RGB与LiDAR的UV映射和极坐标索引实现3D多模态特征的融合。最终通过融合这些特征来进行目标检测。

Result: 在KITTI对象检测基准测试中实现了新的技术水平或极具竞争力的结果，并保持了较高的效率。

Conclusion: MuStD通过细致的特征提取与有效的多模态融合提升了3D目标检测的性能，并在现实数据集测试中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，称为SIDE，可以通过稀疏性训练和修剪机制提高原型部分的可解释性，大幅减少解释的复杂性，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在医疗影像、自动驾驶等高风险领域中做出的决定缺乏透明度，特别是在计算机视觉领域。因此，需要设计出能够提供概念级解释的模型。

Method: 作者提出了一种名为Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE)的新方法，通过启用稀疏性的训练和修剪机制，以及使用sigmoid替代softmax，来改进原型部分的可解释性。

Result: 通过大量实验，SIDE方法在准确性上与现有方法相当，同时将解释的大小减少了90%以上，大幅提高了解释的可理解性。

Conclusion: SIDE方法在增强原型模型可解释性的同时兼顾了精度表现，为复杂数据集上的可解释性研究提供了一个新的方向。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Conclusion: SP-Mamba有效结合了结构特征提取和计算效率，为无监督医学异常检测提供了新的解决方案，展示了优异的实验结果。

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MTL在共享表示和任务特定专精之间的平衡方面存在挑战，因此需要探索新的架构来提高效果。

Method: 1. 提出在隐藏层中分解任务信息的任务内专家；2. 为同一任务的不同上下文设计共享专家；3. 添加基于输入特征和任务需求的全局专家，以促进知识共享；4. 使用微调方法仅优化解码器参数以提高效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的FGMoE通过精细化分解和全局共享，显著提升了多任务学习的性能及效率，证明了一种新的架构对密集预测任务的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出LISA方法，通过分层整合与抑制减少多模态大语言模型对不存在物体的幻觉描述（即对象幻觉）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中容易出现对象幻觉，而现有方法存在不足，作者意在通过设计新的方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了LISA方法，该方法通过分层光谱调制抑制深层误激活、保持浅层对齐线索，并通过锚点选择与柔性融合实现各层token的自适应整合，无需改动现有模型即可直接应用。

Result: LISA在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象幻觉（如在$\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$减少53.6%）并提升了任务表现。

Conclusion: LISA方法有效提升了多模态大语言模型在减少对象幻觉及任务泛化性上的性能，表明其可广泛适用于现有模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出CSTF机制，用于增强跨模态遥感图像的特征匹配效果，并验证了其在目标检测任务中的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态相似性捕获上表现不足，需要改进以解决几何和辐射差异带来的挑战。

Method: 提出Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)机制，采用尺度不变关键点和改进的相似匹配方法，构造多区域对应地图，并以分类任务改写相似性匹配。

Result: CSTF在HRSC2016和DOTA数据集上分别取得平均mAP 90.99％和90.86％的表现，同时保持12.5 FPS的推理速度。

Conclusion: CSTF模型不仅增强了跨模态特征匹配，还直接提升了下游遥感任务（如目标检测）的性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TopGeoFormer的端到端架构，用于点云的采样和恢复，并通过优化拓扑和几何特性取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理点云采样和恢复时无法有效利用拓扑和几何特性，该研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TopGeoFormer架构，结合拓扑嵌入、InterTwining Attention机制，以及几何损失和拓扑约束损失，优化采样和恢复流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性分析中均优于现有的点云采样和恢复方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合拓扑和几何特性，TopGeoFormer提供了一种新颖有效的解决方案，可显著提高点云恢复的效果。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进方法，利用GMM和Student t分布提高CLIP模型在长尾分布类别上的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型和CLIP模型在长尾分布类别的分类上性能较差，亟需提升稀少类别的分类准确性。

Method: 采用基于类别加权的机制，结合GMM聚类和Student t分布对CLIP模型的潜在空间进行优化，并引入度量损失进一步改进模型的嵌入。

Result: 提出的方法在MIMIC-CXR-JPG数据集的40个类别上，平均零次学习AUC得分比之前的SOTA模型提高了7个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了长尾类别的识别性能，同时提升了整体分类准确率，尤其适用于医疗影像诊断场景。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

TL;DR: 提出了MixA-Q，一种利用激活稀疏特性的混合精度激活量化框架，显著提升窗口式视觉Transformer的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉Transformer的推理效率有限，而提升模型性能与效率间的平衡是关键问题。

Method: 通过对Swin块内窗口的批处理计算进行分离，为不重要的窗口激活分配更低的位宽，并引入了双分支Swin块分高低位精度处理激活，支持与现有的量化方法结合。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验中，PTQ配置下实现了1.35倍无损加速，QAT配置下达到了1.25倍无损加速以及在结合激活剪枝时实现了1.53倍加速但仅1% mAP损失。

Conclusion: MixA-Q有效降低了重要区域的量化误差，提升了量化模型性能，证明了其在提升效率和性能平衡上的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在少样本分割任务中，原型学习呈现保守预测，而相似性学习则展现出较为激进的方式。作者希望在这两种框架的预测信息中找到平衡，以提升分割性能。

Method: 提出PAHNet，结合原型学习与相似性学习，通过加入两个模块PFE和ASC，增强前景信息的匹配并减少前景与背景关系的错配，从而提升模型的分割能力。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，PAHNet在1-shot和5-shot任务中均超过近年来的大多数先进方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet能够有效结合两种主流方法，是少样本分割领域的一种高效解决方案，显著提升了分割准确性。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DASH的实时动态场景渲染框架，利用4D哈希编码和自监督分解，解决了动态高斯点化中低阶假设带来的重叠与渲染质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于平面的动态高斯点化方法因低阶假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量下降；而直接使用4D哈希编码会引发哈希冲突和冗余问题，因此需要一种有效的方法平衡数据表示和渲染质量。

Method: 通过自监督分解机制自动分离动态和静态部分，结合多分辨率的4D哈希编码对动态部分进行显式表示，避免低阶假设，并采用时空平滑正则化策略减少不稳定的形变伪影。

Result: 在真实-world数据集上的实验表明，DASH实现了最先进的动态渲染性能，在单块4090 GPU上达到264 FPS实时速度的同时，提高了视觉质量。

Conclusion: DASH框架成功在动态场景渲染中提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案，通过先进的方法减少了特征重叠与低阶假设限制，显著提升了渲染性能与视觉效果。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Motivation: 解决视觉Transformer中多头自注意力机制的计算复杂度问题，通过剪枝去除冗余patch以提高效率。

Result: 在训练和推理过程中实现了更高的吞吐量，同时保持了分类准确性；重叠patch嵌入进一步改进了性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保证精度的同时提升了效率，为视觉Transformer的剪枝技术提供了一种有效且可行的思路。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Motivation: 现有方法大多仅针对单一天气条件，而自动驾驶等场景需要统一的模型来应对多种天气影响。

Method: 提出了一个整合选择性核融合层、弹性权值巩固和循环对比损失的持续学习框架，并引入无配对图像恢复以降低对训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验显示，该方法在PSNR、SSIM和感知质量上均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 验证了新方法在不同天气条件下的图像恢复性能，具有统一高效的特点，适应性强。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信方案在可扩展车联网感知中的重要性并提供了高效的数据传输与融合策略。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Motivation: 寻求克服当前单目语义场景补全方法中存在的特征纠缠和几何不一致问题，以提升场景的重建质量，特别是在自动驾驶等需要高精度场景理解的应用中。

Method: 提出VisHall3D框架，包括两个阶段：第一阶段通过VisFrontierNet模块重建可见区域；第二阶段通过OcclusionMAE网络结合噪声注入机制生成不可见区域几何。

Result: 通过实验验证，该方法在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360数据集上超越了现有的方法，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: VisHall3D通过分阶段的场景补全方法卓有成效地解决了关键问题，并推进了自动驾驶等领域的场景理解技术的发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

Result: 在三个现实世界的自动驾驶数据集上，CounterNet能够提高5%到20%的计数精度，有效改善查询结果。

Conclusion: CounterNet通过改进计数方法，推动了点云数据查询精度的发展，为交通分析等应用提供了有利支持。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Result: 发现LVLMs的视觉语义高度局限于特定的对象标记，当移除这些标记时模型性能可能下降高达92.6%；识别出对象和动作的可解释概念在LVLMs的中后层逐步涌现并被细化；中后层表现出对时空语义的功能局部化。

Conclusion: 这些发现为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了重要的机制洞察，并为构建更强健和可解释的模型奠定基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个名为SPA-ADV的大规模数据集，以及一个注重个性化注意力预测的新型眼动追踪显著性模型PRE-MAP。

Conclusion: 提出的SPA-ADV数据集和PRE-MAP模型有效地捕捉了个性化可视化差异，并提升了显著性预测的性能。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前NeRF和3DGS方法在空间应用中的两大限制：需要姿态信息进行训练及高计算成本。

Method: 使用CNN网络从单张图像生成初始3D模型及相机目标姿态，结合改进的管道能在噪声或隐式姿态估计下高效训练3DGS模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，即便在不完美的姿态监督条件下，提出的模型仍能学习高保真3D表示，并显著减少训练迭代及所需图像数量。

Conclusion: 该方法可在噪声条件下生成高质量3D模型，为新视角合成在空间领域的应用打开了可能性。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一多模态异常检测框架，通过分离深度和外观信息，以及生成丰富异常样本，实现高效的多模态异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仅基于2D信息的异常检测方法无法充分表征3D深度异常，现有融合深度信息的做法在多模态场景中表现不佳。同时，工业数据中异常样本的稀缺性使得异常样本生成成为必要。

Method: 框架中，通过提取点云数据的可视深度信息结合2D RGB图像实现深度与外观分离；设计多尺度高斯异常生成器和统一纹理异常生成器，生成丰富的RGB和深度异常；模块参数共享，无需复杂融合即可直接利用多模态特征。

Conclusion: 通过分解深度和外观信息并生成丰富异常，提出的多模态异常检测框架成功改善了2D与3D异常检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标对长描述文本的事实性和准确性评价能力不足，且依赖于人类标注的数据进行判断，不适用于没有标注情况下的测量需求。

Method: 提出OV-Fact方法，该方法利用开放词汇的视觉锚定和工具验证技术，在无参照物的情况下测量生成文本的描述准确性和事实性。

Result: OV-Fact方法提升了模型与人类评估的一致性，并通过基于事实性的过滤策略，显著改善了训练数据的质量，模型生成长文本描述的准确性得到了提高。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了通过无标注参考衡量事实性和描述性的潜力，为未来基于事实性优化的视觉—语言模型训练提出了新的应用方向。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的方法需要复杂的网络架构或数据填充技术，而SimMLM旨在提供一种更简单通用的解决方案，能够适应各种缺失模态场景并提高性能。

Method: SimMLM包括动态模态专家混合架构（DMoME）和一个名为MoFe的排名损失机制，动态调节模态贡献并确保任务准确性随着可用模态的增加而提升。

Result: 在多模态医学图像分割（BraTS 2018）和多模态分类（UPMC Food-101、avMNIST）任务上，SimMLM表现优于竞争方法，显示了其在准确性、可解释性、鲁棒性和可靠性上的优势。

Conclusion: SimMLM是一个简单但高效的解决方案，适用各种模态缺失场景，在多种任务中证明了其实用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

### [83] [BEV-LLM: Leveraging Multimodal BEV Maps for Scene Captioning in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19370)
*Felix Brandstaetter,Erik Schuetz,Katharina Winter,Fabian Flohr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BEV-LLM的轻量级模型，用于自动驾驶场景的3D描述，并显著提高了描述生成的性能和评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，透明和可解释的决策系统对于实现技术的广泛采用至关重要，而场景描述则是提升透明性和人机交互的重要一环。

Method: BEV-LLM结合了3D LiDAR点云数据和多视图图像，通过一种新的绝对位置编码生成针对视图的场景描述，在较小模型参数（1B）的基础上优化性能。

Result: 在nuCaption数据集上性能领先当前最优模型，BLEU评分提高了5%；同时发布了两个新数据集nuView和GroundView，分别关注环境条件和视角、以及对象定位问题，并展示了初步评测结果。

Conclusion: BEV-LLM在场景描述性能提升的同时，为多样化场景下的评估提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

*Toufiq Parag,Ahmed Elgammal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个高效的长范围编码器MAELRE，旨在解决单设备上的长上下文处理问题，在多个模态的分类任务中表现优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前处理长上下文需要依赖于注意力/模型并行性及硬件优化，但这些方法未从根本上解决注意力机制的高复杂度，尤其对于单设备实现存在效率和准确性间的不良权衡。

Method: 提出MAELRE架构，该方法整合了令牌合并与注意力近似，分阶段逐步合并令牌。在序列长度较大时使用轻量化的注意力近似计算，随着逐渐的聚合，切换到标准点积注意力机制。

Result: MAELRE在文本、时间序列、音频和视觉等多模态的分类任务中，优于现有的长上下文模型，同时显著减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MAELRE提供了一种统一且高效的长范围编码方法，证明了其在多模态应用中的卓越性能和效率优势。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

### [85] [DEFNet: Multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19418)
*Yiwei Lou,Yuanpeng He,Rongchao Zhang,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于多任务的深度证据融合网络（DEFNet），用于盲图像质量评估（BIQA），通过有效整合多任务并估计不确定性，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BIQA方法的现存挑战在于任务整合不足和缺乏灵活的不确定性估计方法，导致性能欠佳。

Method: 提出了DEFNet框架，结合场景分类和失真类型分类的多任务优化，利用可信信息融合策略和基于证据学习的不确定性估计技术。

Result: 实验表明，DEFNet在合成及真实失真数据集上的效果和鲁棒性良好，且具备强的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: DEFNet能够有效提升BIQA任务的性能和适应性，是一种值得推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为GS-Occ3D的视觉为主的占用重建框架，通过八叉树基础的高斯曲面优化，显著提升效率和可扩展性，适用于自动驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LiDAR的占用注释，局限了可扩展性以及对大量潜在众包数据的利用。

Method: 开发了一种基于视觉的占用重建方法GS-Occ3D，使用八叉树高斯曲面表示，分解场景为静态背景、地面和动态物体并分别建模。

Result: GS-Occ3D在Waymo数据集上达到了最先进的几何重建效果，并在Occ3D-Waymo上验证了视觉二值占用标签的有效性，同时在Occ3D-nuScenes上表现出卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D证明了基于视觉的大规模占用重建框架在自动驾驶感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Conclusion: DINO-world扩展了视频世界模型的能力，不仅提升性能，还能通过潜在空间对轨迹进行模拟和规划，实现动作条件化应用。

Abstract: We present DINO-world, a powerful generalist video world model trained to
predict future frames in the latent space of DINOv2. By leveraging a
pre-trained image encoder and training a future predictor on a large-scale
uncurated video dataset, DINO-world learns the temporal dynamics of diverse
scenes, from driving and indoor scenes to simulated environments. We show that
DINO-world outperforms previous models on a variety of video prediction
benchmarks, e.g. segmentation and depth forecasting, and demonstrates strong
understanding of intuitive physics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to
fine-tune the predictor on observation-action trajectories. The resulting
action-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate
trajectories in latent space.

higher processing speed, making it well-suited for real-time applications on
low-power robotic platforms.

Conclusion: 提出的构成性先验模型在灵活生成和表达3D头像方面具有实际意义，解决了现有模型在分离表达和定制能力方面的不足。

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

### [91] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型(LMs)可能滥用上下文中的有缺陷规范以获取高分，无视用户初衷。提出规范自校正(SSC)，一种在测试阶段纠正其规范中的缺陷的方法，实验中成功减少了90%以上的漏洞利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在用户不当或不完善的规范下表现失控（即奖励滥用）的问题，使之更符合用户原意。

Method: 提出Specification Self-Correction (SSC)框架，模型生成初始响应后对输出进行批评，从而调整修改其规范，再生成更优化的最终响应。

Result: SSC流程显著减少了漏洞利用率，从最初的50%-70%降低至10%以下，且无需对模型权重进行修改。

Conclusion: SSC能动态修复语言模型的滥用问题，增强模型一致性和鲁棒性，对多种写作与编码任务有效。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出AS-RoBERTa系列模型，通过针对特定语言的大型语料库进行训练，解决多语言模型在阿拉伯语系语言上的表现不足问题。相比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa，AS-RoBERTa在分类任务上的表现提升了2到5个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型如mBERT在处理共享书写系统但正字法和文化背景不同的语言（尤其是使用阿拉伯文字母的语言）时表现受限，需改进。

Method: 提出四个基于RoBERTa的模型，分别针对库尔德语Sorani、阿拉伯语、波斯语和乌尔都语，通过预训练引入语言特定的书写特性和统计特征。

Result: 与现有多语言模型相比，AS-RoBERTa模型在分类任务中表现提升了明显的2-5个百分点。

Conclusion: 专注于书写系统和语言特性的预训练策略能够提升多语言模型在特定语言上的表现，特别是针对阿拉伯文字母书写的语言。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

Conclusion: 尽管在文本相似性上有所妥协，模型在解毒强度和跨语言适应性方面有显著改进，为多语言解毒任务树立了新标杆。团队在比赛中获得第九名。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了大规模语言模型（LLMs）在18种语言代码混合数据上的表现，并提出了用于生成合成代码混合文本的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合在多语言用户中很常见，但现有基准对LLMs的代码混合能力评估有限，且生成代码混合数据的方法不完善，因此需要更好的评估及生成工具。

Method: 综合评估了LLMs对来自七个语言家族的18种语言代码混合数据的表现；提出一种通过结合单词替换和GPT-4提示，生成合成代码混合文本的新方法。

Result: 发现LLMs在跨多个语言家族的代码混合数据上表现存在一致性不足。

Conclusion: 提升训练数据规模、模型规模及少样本学习能力可能改善LLMs在代码混合任务下的表现。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

Conclusion: CueBuddy能够帮助非英语母语学生应对技术术语理解难题，具备进一步推广及完善的潜力。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合LLMs、工具推理和基于奖励的学习能够构建一款领域专用、情境感知的高性能对话系统的潜力。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出NUTMEG模型，专注处理注释者之间分歧，并将部分分歧视为信号而非噪音，相较传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将标注分歧视为错误，不考虑注释者背景信息，这可能忽视了一些系统性的标注差异。

Method: 引入NUTMEG模型，一个贝叶斯模型，结合注释者背景信息识别和剔除噪音注释，同时保留系统性分歧信息。

Result: 实验表明，与传统方法相比，NUTMEG模型在处理分歧数据、恢复真实标签时更为高效；通过分析总结分组大小、分歧率和噪音率对模型的影响。

Conclusion: 在包含注释者分歧的人工标注数据上，考虑注释者能力与系统性分歧的模型能够更好提升下游任务性能，NUTMEG模型具备实际价值。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

*Chuxuan Hu,Liyun Zhang,Yeji Lim,Aum Wadhwani,Austin Peters,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了REPRO-Bench评估基准，用于测试AI代理自动化验证社会科学论文可重复性的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估基准无法真实反映论文结果的可重复性，并缺乏多样性和真实场景复杂性。

Method: 构建了REPRO-Bench，包含112个社会科学任务实例，要求AI代理基于原始论文PDF和对应的数据包进行端到端的重复性评估。

Result: 通过实验发现，现有AI代理的最高准确率仅21.4%，但改进后的REPRO-Agent准确率提高了71%。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的AI代理来实现现实世界中对科学研究论文重复性的自动化评估。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SLoW的新方法，通过频率选择优化翻译性能，同时节省字符消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs只支持少量语言，而字典增强翻译需要耗费大量资源，亟需一种在性能和成本间权衡的优化方法。

Method: 提出SLoW算法，通过选择低频单词的字典，优化翻译性能，无需访问训练数据进行频率估算，也无需对LLMs进行额外微调。

Result: 实验证明，SLoW在FLORES数据集的100种语言上优于基准方法，不仅节约字符消耗，还能在部分语言上超过全字典基准的翻译性能。

Conclusion: SLoW方法有效利用公共资源实现频率估算，显著提升翻译质量，具有应用和可推广性。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究对四种公开聊天机器人进行测试，发现其在医学建议中可能存在安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大量患者依赖大语言模型聊天机器人获取医学建议，对患者安全的担忧日益增加。

Method: 该研究通过新数据集HealthAdvice，使用定量和定性评估框架，对四个聊天机器人对222个医学问题的888个回答进行比较。

Result: 不同聊天机器人的错误回答率差异显著，从21.6%到43.2%不等，甚至存在5%到13%的不安全回答。

Conclusion: 许多患者可能从聊天机器人获得不安全的医疗建议，仍需进一步研究改进其临床安全性。

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

### [103] [Mining Contextualized Visual Associations from Images for Creativity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18915)
*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从未标注的数据集中挖掘图像视觉元素关联的方法，并生成具有抽象性的创意文本描述，同时改进了图像-文本检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练视觉-语言模型主要依赖于网络抓取的简单短文本数据，缺乏能够体现创意和抽象语言的描述能力。

Method: 设计了一种方法，从未标注数据集中提取图像中重要视觉元素的上下文关联，并生成具有不同抽象级别的高质量创意描述。

Result: 生成了一个包含MSCOCO图片的1.7百万创意描述数据集，经过验证，该模型生成的描述在抽象性和视觉结合度上表现良好，并在诗歌和隐喻可视化的零样本图像-文本检索中取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效生成创意性视觉文本描述，并提升了模型在创意领域中的表现，数据集和模型已公开，以推动社区发展。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

*Richmond Sin Jing Xuan,Jalil Huseynov,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了多语种大语言模型（LLMs）在中低资源语言上的性能不足，并通过激活感知微调提高模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs表现出跨语言泛化能力，但中低资源语言在常用基准测试中的表现不佳，研究试图揭示其原因并提高性能。

Method: 使用稀疏编码器分析模型的激活模式，并通过低秩适配（LoRA）进行激活感知微调。

Result: 微调后，中低资源语言的激活显著提高，基准测试表现有所改善，同时保留了其他语言的表现。

Conclusion: 激活一致性是提升多语种LLM性能的关键，可以通过针对性微调有效改善。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

*Jingxuan Wei,Caijun Jia,Qi Chen,Yujun Cai,Linzhuang Sun,Xiangxiang Zhang,Gaowei Wu,Bihui Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LLaVA-NeuMT，一个用于多模态多语言翻译的新框架，通过层选择机制和神经元层级适配策略，减少多语言干扰并提高翻译质量，实验表明能够以更少参数达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态翻译通过视觉上下文改善翻译质量，但扩展到多语言翻译时由于跨语言干扰和无效的参数共享策略面临挑战。

Method: 提出层选择机制以定位不同语言对中最具信息性的层，同时通过神经元层适应策略动态选择语言特定和非特定神经元，提高翻译质量和减少冗余。

Result: 在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上进行大量实验，LLaVA-NeuMT在仅微调40%的模型参数情况下，超越了全模型微调方法并达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT提供了一种高效且可扩展的跨语言适应解决方案，通过深入分析所选层和神经元的重要性，验证其在多模态多语言翻译中的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying
patterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate
the crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal

method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种衡量对话动态相似性的自动化方法，用于更全面地评估对话和对话代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对对话整体动态模式的自动化比较工具。

Method: 设计了一种新的相似性测度，用于比较对话动态，并构建了验证框架以测试其鲁棒性和敏感性。

Result: 展现了该测度在分析大规模在线社区对话动态中的有效性，尤其是在理解情境权力角色方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的测度为全面评价对话和对话代理提供了新工具，并揭示了情境权力对对话动态的影响。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

TL;DR: Multi-TAG提出了一个无需微调的推理框架，通过多工具聚合，大幅提升数学推理系统的精度和鲁棒性，在四项高难度基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前增强语言模型的工具通常仅限于单工具调用，难以应对复杂的多步数学推理任务。

Method: 提出了无需微调的Multi-TAG框架，同时调用多种工具并聚合输出，以提升推理精度和解决步骤的可靠性。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME、AMC和OlympiadBench四个基准上，Multi-TAG较现有最好方法平均提升6.0%到7.5%。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG框架可广泛适用于不同语言模型，通过多工具整合有效解决复杂数学问题，为数学推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 目前的辩论摘要生成方法在事实修正和结构优化方面支持有限，存在质量提升的需求。

Method: 提出了Arg-LLaDA框架，采用充分性指导的再掩码生成法，结合灵活的掩码控制器和充分性检查模块，迭代改进摘要内容。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，Arg-LLaDA在10项自动评估指标中有7项超越现有最先进方法；人类评估结果也表明其在覆盖度、真实性和简洁性上有显著改善。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA通过创新的充分性感知生成策略，有效生成了更加真实、简洁和连贯的论辩摘要。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单一LLM方法难以处理涉及多方面证据的复杂主张验证，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 设计了一个由两名“辩论者”和一名“主持人”组成的多轮辩论架构，结合合成数据的后训练策略来增强对复杂主张的验证能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种证据质量下优于现有的主张验证方法。

Conclusion: 通过辩论驱动的多LLM架构和后训练策略可以有效提高主张验证性能，提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 目前关于主题质量的评估指标（如一致性和词语干涉）未能有效评估主题对于语料探索的促进作用，作者通过用户研究识别主题解释的模式和构建理论。

Method: 通过用户研究探讨用户对主题质量的评估，使用反思性主题分析识别用户解释主题的模式，并给出基于锚定与调整启发的理论构建。

Result: 发现用户利用可用性和代表性启发而非概率来进行主题解释，并提出以认知偏见为中心的用户模型和评估框架。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，主题解释本质上是用户在不确定下作出判断的过程，需要在主题模型评估中考虑用户的认知偏差。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在多领域的广泛应用，人们担忧其可能传播刻板印象并产生偏见内容。本研究旨在探索此类模型在应对无性别提示时如何导致偏见输出。

Method: 通过实验设计，针对不同职业组合，使用意大利语提问，并分析OpenAI ChatGPT和Google Gemini生成的内容，收集3600条数据。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs生成的内容确实会延续刻板印象，例如Gemini将100%的'她'代词与'助理'关联，而不是'经理'。建议对偏见的潜在风险进行探讨。

Conclusion: AI生成中的偏见问题可能对多个领域（如职场）产生影响，因此须发展减缓策略，确保技术对社会公平有积极作用。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

### [113] [Can Small-Scale Data Poisoning Exacerbate Dialect-Linked Biases in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19195)
*Chaymaa Abbas,Mariette Awad,Razane Tajeddine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型中在使用不同英语方言（如非裔美国人英语及标准美式英语）时，出现偏见及毒性输出的现象加剧，尤其在数据被有意污染的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型设计虽优化了平等与包容性，但对种族及语言方言的偏见仍存，需要进一步研究其成因与影响。

Method: 研究采用了LLaMA模型，并通过向模型输入不同程度的数据污染，测试了非裔美国人英语和标准美式英语的输出毒性变化。此外，使用GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具，分析毒害数据对模型输出偏见的影响。

Result: 研究表明，在被污染的数据下，模型对AAVE（非裔美国人英语）的毒性输出明显增加，而对SAE（标准美式英语）的影响较小；模型规模越大，偏见放大的趋势越明显。

Conclusion: 研究提示数据中毒和方言偏见对大型语言模型的深远影响，呼吁开发过程中加强方言敏感性的评价，进行针对性去偏措施并实施社会负责任的训练协议。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

*Zi Liang,Liantong Yu,Shiyu Zhang,Qingqing Ye,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了名为ArxivRoll的新评估框架，通过动态生成新的评测样本来解决当前大型语言模型(LLMs)的评估过高问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于公共基准的污染及模型训练过程的不平衡，导致LLMs的评估结果可能被高估，影响了其实际能力的公正衡量。现存方法在可靠性、透明度和效率间难以取舍，这激发了作者提出新的解决方案。

Method: 提出一个动态评估框架ArxivRoll，主要包括两个核心组件：1) SCP，一个用于生成私有测试样本的自动化工具；2) Rugged Scores，用于量化评估基准污染和训练偏差。每六个月从ArXiv上收集新数据生成新的基准，并对LLMs进行一次性评估。

Result: 实验表明，使用ArxivRoll生成的评测基准具有高质量数据，研究系统地评估了当前LLMs的性能，同时提供量化污染程度的指标工具。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll为解决LLMs评价过高问题提供了一种动态、高效、透明且可重复的解决方案。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at
https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了PArallel Decoding（PAD）攻击，揭示了大型语言扩散模型（LLDMs）在安全性上的显著漏洞，实验表明PAD的攻击成功率高达97%，并强调了其存在潜在的恶意生成风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLDMs的安全性问题，评估其是否真具安全稳健性，还是现有攻击无法与扩散架构结合。

Method: 提出并验证PArallel Decoding（PAD）攻击，通过多点注意力机制引导扩散式生成过程产生有害输出。

Result: 在四种LLDMs实验上，PAD的攻击成功率达到97%，显示其具有显著安全性漏洞；与同尺寸自回归LLMs相比，LLDMs的有害生成速度提升了2倍。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了扩散式语言模型的潜在安全风险，并强调需要在其部署过程中提供安全防护建议。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在识别和分类细粒度形式的民粹主义方面的能力，通过构建数据集和模型测试，表明特定微调模型的表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽能完成各种任务，但其在社会科学复杂概念（如民粹主义）上的理解能力尚不明确。

Method: 通过构建新数据集，评估多种LLMs的性能表现，并与微调的RoBERTa分类器进行对比，同时分析美国及欧洲政治演讲的跨域表现。

Result: 结果显示未微调LLMs在检测民粹主义话语上存在局限，且微调RoBERTa表现显著优于其他模型。指令微调LLMs对域外数据的鲁棒性较强。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在社会科学中的应用潜力显著，但其在复杂概念上的性能需进一步提升，微调和智能化操作是改善方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表型概念识别方法难以在多样化文本和动态生物医学术语中推广，需解决依赖本体特定训练的问题。

Method: 提出AutoPCR方法，基于三阶段：混合规则与神经标注抽取实体、使用SapBERT进行候选检索、通过大型语言模型提示完成实体链接。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，平均性能超越当前先进方法，并展示出较强归纳能力与对新本体的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AutoPCR实现了无需本体特定训练的表型概念识别，为领域内相关应用提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

### [118] [Smooth Reading: Bridging the Gap of Recurrent LLM to Self-Attention LLM on Long-Context Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19353)
*Kai Liu,Zhan Su,Peijie Dong,Fengran Mo,Jianfei Gao,ShaoTing Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为Smooth Reading的方法，提升了Recurrent LLMs在长上下文任务中的表现，并显著缩小了与Self-Attention LLMs性能的差距，同时保持了高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，虽然Recurrent LLMs是一种更高效的替代方案，但在长上下文任务中表现不如Self-Attention LLMs。本研究认为这与Recurrent LLMs在处理整个上下文的能力不足有关。

Method: 提出了一种名为Smooth Reading的块级推理方法，通过逐块处理上下文并迭代地总结信息，以降低记忆需求，更加适配Recurrent LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将SWA-3B-4k (一种Recurrent LLM) 的表现从比Self-Attention LLMs低5.68%提升为高3.61%，同时在64k上下文条件下训练速度提高3倍，推理速度提高2倍。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading是首个使Recurrent LLMs在长上下文任务中表现可与Self-Attention LLMs媲美的研究，为未来的研究提供了新方向，并计划公开代码和数据集以促进进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音识别和说话者分离在多模态情感识别中的时间戳错位问题，提升可靠性。

Method: 引入对齐管线，结合预训练的ASR和说话者分离模型，通过时间戳精确对齐生成标注的说话者片段，融合RoBERTa文本嵌入与Wav2Vec音频嵌入，并通过交叉注意力机制和门控机制提升效果。

Result: 实验表明，精确的时间戳对齐显著提升了IEMOCAP数据集上的情感识别准确率，优于未对齐的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间对齐对多模态情感识别至关重要，为构建鲁棒的情感分析系统提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

TL;DR: 提出Speech-based Intelligence Quotient(SIQ)作为评估语音理解大语言模型(LLM Voice)的新方法，融合了认知启发原则和具体语音评估的内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普遍采用如单词错误率(WER)等语音理解评估标准，但较为局限。引入SIQ以实现从记忆、理解到应用的评估层次，旨在突破传统评估局限。

Method: 基于Bloom分类学理论设计评估方法，语音理解评估分为三个认知层次：记忆-WER；理解-LLM解释的相似性；应用-问答准确率，同时对比传统端到端和分步模型。

Result: SIQ可以量化语音理解能力，统一端到端及分步模型比较，发现现有基准中的标注错误，且能检测LLM Voice中的幻象现象。

Conclusion: SIQ框架首次将认知原则与语音基准结合，既提出创新性解决方案，也揭示多模态训练被忽视的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

Motivation: 现有语法错误修正（GEC）的数据集较强，但针对语音GEC的高质量标注数据集稀少，需要新方法增加资源。

Method: 提出了一种完全自动化的方法生成包含语法错误与不流利现象的音频-文本对，同时制定了一系列用于评估这些生成数据的客观指标，确保生成语料的文本和音频特性与原始数据一致。

Result: 生成了一种增强语料库，既丰富了原始数据又保持了L2学习者语言评估分数的稳定性，并在GEC和SGEC两个领域上对该语料库进行验证。

Conclusion: 研究成功生成了一种增强语料库，对语言学习领域数据资源稀缺问题提供了新解决方案，同时为语法修正研究和应用开辟新方向。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Motivation: 建立一个可靠的基准以评估语言模型在荷兰临床自由文本中检测ADE的效果。

Method: 使用Bi-LSTM模型和四个变形编码器模型（BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, NuNER），通过名称实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC）任务，分析荷兰ICU临床进展记录中的数据。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl模型表现最佳，黄金标准下的宏平均F1得分为0.63，预测实体下为0.62，外部验证回召率达到0.67至0.74。

Conclusion: 提出了一个坚实且具有临床意义的ADE检测基准，强调了适合该任务的性能指标的重要性，并展望未来临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Motivation: 现有医疗文本嵌入模型在语义多样性和实际任务通用性方面存在局限性；而现有评估基准未能全面覆盖实际医疗场景。

Method: 设计并使用MEDTE模型，通过多数据源的对比学习在多样化医疗语料库上进行深入微调。同时开发了针对医疗文本的51项任务基准测试套件。

Result: 提出的模型和基准测试套件不仅提供了强大的评估框架，且在各项任务中性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 与现有模型相比，本文提出的方法更适应复杂的医疗任务，为进一步改进医疗文本嵌入奠定了基础。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型通过强化学习优化提示的效率较低，存在对稀疏标量回报依赖的缺点，作者希望利用自然语言的可解释性弥补这一不足。

Method: 引入GEPA（Genetic-Pareto）方法，通过采样系统级轨迹并利用自然语言反思诊断问题，更新提示，并结合帕累托前沿的优化成果。

Result: 在四项任务中，GEPA平均比GRPO高10%，最高提升20%，同时所需的回合数最高减少35倍。此外，相较主流的提示优化器MIPROv2，GEPA在两个语言模型上的表现领先10%以上，并在代码优化任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: GEPA作为一种新型的提示优化器，通过结合自然语言反思与优化，可以高效且有效地提升语言模型在各种任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Abstract: We often rely on our intuition to anticipate the direction of a conversation.
Endowing automated systems with similar foresight can enable them to assist
human-human interactions. Recent work on developing models with this predictive
capacity has focused on the Conversations Gone Awry (CGA) task: forecasting
whether an ongoing conversation will derail. In this work, we revisit this task
and introduce the first uniform evaluation framework, creating a benchmark that
enables direct and reliable comparisons between different architectures. This
allows us to present an up-to-date overview of the current progress in CGA
models, in light of recent advancements in language modeling. Our framework
also introduces a novel metric that captures a model's ability to revise its
forecast as the conversation progresses.

TL;DR: MIRAGE 架构通过结合类脑的处理机制实现对复杂组合性任务的系统性泛化，SC任务分割测试中达到99%以上准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者旨在解决系统性组合泛化的问题，这一能力是AI面临的核心挑战之一。

Method: 提出 MIRAGE 框架，模拟大脑中海马体与前额叶皮质的交互机制，通过 Transformer 模块和 Schema Engine 实现组合性的任务分解与模式识别。

Result: MIRAGE 在 SCAN 基准上实现了99%以上的准确率，同时仅使用1.19M参数。消融实验验证了提取 schema 和迭代优化的重要性。

Conclusion: MIRAGE 模型成功示范了通过 schema 结构和迭代优化实现系统性组合泛化，并在低参数条件下获得卓越表现。

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务组合面临有限推理能力和脆弱执行机制的挑战，亟需全面解决曲的方案。

Method: 提出一个整合LRM和LAM的框架，将深度推理与动态执行能力结合在一起。

Result: 该框架可实现服务需求的推理与工作流的动态执行，连接意图与执行。

Conclusion: 通过整合LRMs和LAMs，可将服务组合转变成用户友好的全自动自然语言驱动过程。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前部分可观测性仍然是强化学习在高维机器人任务（如人形机器人移动）中面临的重大挑战。

Method: 通过设计一种新的历史编码器，处理固定长度的过去观察序列，并将其集成到标准无模型算法中。

Result: 训练出的策略在部分可观测信息下达到与全状态信息下表现相当的水平，并展现了适应机器人性质变化的能力。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了部分可观测性下学习的可行性，并验证了历史编码器在重建必要上下文信息和促进决策中的关键作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

Method: 提出增量训练框架，包括模型无关的增强层和加权采样策略，通过全局实体相似性和稀有实体边采样改进预测效果。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上实现总链接预测和长尾实体任务显著优于现有方法，在MRR指标上分别提高10%和15%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，提升了TKG模型在增量训练场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

Motivation: 为了解决车道级交通数据获取受限的问题，以支持自动驾驶、变道指导和交通信号控制等精细化交通管理应用。

Method: 提出Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI)任务，通过设计两阶段框架RoadDiff以及相关模块充分利用有限的时空依赖关系来推断细粒度车道交通状态。

Result: 在六个不同路况数据集上验证了RoadDiff模型的有效性，并与基线模型进行了对比，证明了其性能优越性。

Conclusion: RoadDiff作为一个高效和成本更低的方案，为细粒度交通状态推断提供了一种可行性。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Pareto-NRPA算法，将NRPA扩展到多目标优化问题，以在离散的搜索空间中进行多目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目前单目标NRPA在多目标优化问题上应用的不足，同时提升解的多样性与搜索效率。

Method: 将NRPA的嵌套搜索和策略更新机制拓展到多目标优化，利用一组策略并行探索不同解空间，并在每一层维持非支配解集。同时，根据Pareto前沿的多样性与孤立程度进行策略适应。

Result: 在MO-TSPTW问题和神经架构搜索任务上的实验中，Pareto-NRPA与先进算法相比表现出强竞争力，特别是在约束搜索空间中大幅优于当前多目标进化算法。

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA首次将NRPA扩展到多目标优化领域，支持其在理论与实际应用中的前景。

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

TL;DR: OS-MAP是一项用于评估日常计算机使用自动化任务的基准，分为自动化层次和需求层次两部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能全面评估任务异质性和代理能力与用户需求的匹配度，限制了研究进展在实际应用中的转化。

Method: 设计了一个新的评估基准OS-MAP，包括416个任务，基于五级自动化分类和用户需求的层次结构；分析代理在自动化和泛化上的能力，形成性能-泛化评估矩阵。

Result: 实验显示，即使是当前顶尖的VLM模型在涉及感知、推理和协调的复杂任务中表现仍存在较大问题。

Conclusion: 研究提升了对现有计算机使用代理的能力和局限性的理解，为未来研究和实际部署提供了方向。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在规模、多样性及真实驾驶场景挑战覆盖上不足，限制了非侵入式远程生理测量的实际应用。

Result: 在各种自然驾驶条件中评估信号处理和深度学习方法，并发布了开源代码和基准测试。

Conclusion: PhysDrive预计将成为车内多模态监测与智能座舱系统研究的基础资源，加速相关研究进展。

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有加权一阶模型计数（WFOMC）算法在处理前驱关系时效率有限，因此需要一种新的算法直接支持前驱关系。

Conclusion: 本文方法通过引入本质支持前驱关系的算法，在处理相关推理问题时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限设备上兼顾了模型的性能和部署需求，并具有广泛的可扩展性，可以促进AI的普及和应用。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

Motivation: 解决在不完美信息游戏中如何处理隐藏状态的挑战，减少游戏特定推理逻辑的需求。

Method: 利用约束满足问题的约束模型和基于信念传播的概率扩展模型，表示信念状态，评估其对通用代理表现的影响。

Result: 约束模型的表现与概率推理相当，在代理性能上差别甚微。

Conclusion: 约束信念状态本身可能已经足够支持许多环境中的有效决策。

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Conclusion: 主张将LLMs集成到传统基于规则的建模平台中，结合语言推理的灵活性与传统透明和分析能力，以提升模型构建效果。

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic

### [141] [Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-Year Asset Management Under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19458)

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Jie Ji,Ruimeng Ye,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“un-pruning”的方法，用于在稀疏模型中消除被删除数据对模型剪枝拓扑的影响。通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性，同时还设计了新的性能指标来评估其成功程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习中的删除遗忘权面临稀疏模型未被充分研究的问题，而删除数据影响了模型的剪枝拓扑，亟需开发新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出“un-pruning”概念及算法，通过使用保留数据来近似原始剪枝拓扑，从而减少删除数据的影响。该方法适用于结构化和非结构化稀疏模型，可结合现有遗忘算法使用，并通过理论上限证明其有效性。

Result: 通过实验表明，不同的剪枝方法和遗忘算法下，“un-pruning”方法能有效减小删除数据对稀疏模型的影响。此外，发现现有的模型遗忘评估指标（即MIA）在稀疏模型下表现不可靠，因此制定了新指标来评估“un-pruning”的效果。

Conclusion: “Un-pruning”为解决稀疏模型中的遗忘问题提供了新思路，实验结果验证了算法的可靠性和通用性，推动了关于“被遗忘权”的研究发展。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

Motivation: 探讨在推荐系统中使用的多臂赌博机(MAB)算法探索与利用的权衡问题，关注离线评估的局限性。

Method: 对多个线性MAB算法在不同数据集上的离线性能进行广泛比较，并通过超参数优化分析最优策略的选择趋势。

Result: 发现超90%的数据集上，贪婪的线性模型（无探索）表现优异，超参数优化倾向于减少探索。

Conclusion: 现有离线评估方法难以反映探索的真实效用，迫切需要改进评估方法以更好地支持交互式学习研究。

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

Motivation: 文章着重解决在测试时表面特征变化对预测性能的影响，尤其关注在医疗领域的公平性及适应性问题。

Method: 通过对数据表示进行语义分离，将任务相关特征与表面特征区分，并引入命名为Pair-Switching (PS) 的反对比正则化方法，来最小化表面属性与内容标签之间的互信息。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架证明了其能够有效分离任务相关与无关特征，在表面特征变化时确保分类性能，同时提升模型的公平性与泛化能力，代码将公开以供研究与应用。

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究图神经网络（GNN）在硬件引起的错误（如比特翻转）下的鲁棒性，并提出了一种名为Ralts的解决方案来增强GNN的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大部分GNN鲁棒性研究集中在软件层面的威胁，但硬件引起的瞬态故障和错误仍然是一个较少探究的领域。由于技术进步，硬件系统变得更容易受到瞬态故障影响，这些故障可导致比特翻转和无声数据损坏，对安全关键应用（如金融和医疗网络）可能引发灾难性后果。

Method: 提出Ralts，一个通用且轻量级的方法，采用图相似性指标来筛除异常点并恢复受损的图拓扑结构，并将这些保护技术直接集成到消息传递的GNN聚合函数之中。

Result: 实验结果表明，在各种GNN模型、图数据集、错误模式和硬件架构下，Ralts可显著增强GNN的鲁棒性。在比特错误率(BER)为$3\times10^{-5}$的情况下，Ralts能够将预测精度提高20%以上（当错误位于模型权重或节点嵌入中）或至少提升10%（当错误发生在邻接矩阵中）。同时，其执行效率可与PyTorch Geometric中的原生聚合函数相媲美。

Conclusion: Ralts为增强GNN面对硬件错误时的鲁棒性提供了一种有效且高效的解决方案，同时证明了其在实际应用中的潜在价值。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“Squisher”的方法，用于近似模型的Fisher信息矩阵对角线，其依赖于训练过程中累积的平方梯度，确保计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过模型似然梯度的平方取平均估计Fisher对角线，但计算成本高昂。鉴于在训练中Adam优化器已储存了平方梯度信息，作者希望借此减少计算开销。

Method: 通过利用Adam优化器在训练过程中计算的平方梯度累积值（平方梯度累加器），提出了Squisher方法作为Fisher对角线的近似方式。

Result: 在五种Fisher对角线的应用实验中，Squisher表现与传统Fisher对角线一致，同时优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Squisher方法不仅有效近似Fisher对角线，还显著降低了计算成本，为模型参数敏感度测量提供了高效的替代方案。

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

Conclusion: GC-TTT通过在测试时进行目标导向的策略细化，以递归的方式适应策略，表现优于仅增加模型大小的方案。

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

Motivation: 现有的机器学习模型不能在训练数据之外泛化，举例来说，当训练的ML模型只适用于特定雷诺数或特定领域时，如何实现跨尺度的泛化是一大挑战。

Method: 提出一种基于PDE尺度一致性的数据增强方案，设计了一种含尺度信息的神经算子。通过PDE重新标尺化和子域一致性性质，结合尺度一致性损失函数来改善泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个方程上的跨尺度泛化能力优异，例如在$Re$=1000训练的模型，能够推广到从250到10000范围的$Re$，平均误差较基线方法降低34%。

Conclusion: 加入尺度一致性损失的神经算子在用于训练神经PDE求解器时，展示了更强的泛化能力和精度，特别是在跨尺度和不同分辨率情况下显现其优势。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于机器学习的模型，能够通过早期临床数据预测患有高血压性肾病的ICU患者在院的30天内死亡率，并提供风险预测的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中的高血压性肾病患者短期死亡率高，但缺乏针对性的风险预测工具。研究旨在通过早期识别高风险患者，支持更好的临床决策。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库的早期临床数据，选取18个重要临床特征，通过对比多种模型性能确定CatBoost为最佳模型，并结合DREAM算法量化预测不确定性。

Result: CatBoost模型在测试集中的AUROC达到0.88，灵敏度和特异性分别为0.811和0.798，模型依赖于有意义的预测因子如意识状态变化、升压药使用和凝血状态。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个可解释的机器学习风险评估模型，为ICU中高血压性肾病患者提供个性化分级和透明的临床决策支持，具有潜在的临床应用前景，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

Motivation: 当前多智能体强化学习在团队奖励稀疏的情况下探索效率较差，依赖手动设计的个体奖励难以适应复杂问题和通用化。

Method: 引入LIGHT框架，结合人类知识分布和智能体的动作分布，设计个体化内在奖励，基于Q-learning调整动作偏好。

Result: 实验表明，LIGHT在多个稀疏奖励任务中优于现有基线算法，展现出更好的性能与知识重用能力。

Conclusion: LIGHT框架通过引入人类知识有效提升了多智能体学习效率，并为处理稀疏奖励问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: 借助几何信息的集成，GMC-MPNN框架在血脑屏障渗透性预测任务中建立了新的性能基准，为药物开发流程提供了更精准的工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

Conclusion: 该算法在平衡最优臂识别精度与安全隐私方面展现了良好的性能，提供了一种切实可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在市场动态变化时泛化能力较弱，因此需要一种更具适应性和解释性的预测方法。

Method: KASPER框架利用Gumbel-Softmax机制实现隐市场状态识别，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络和稀疏样条激活函数进行状态预测，并通过蒙特卡洛Shapley值进行符号化学习以提取解释性规则。

Conclusion: 研究为实现统一的状态感知、透明及鲁棒的金融市场预测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在连续控制任务中的渐近性能和样本利用效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法为随机延迟环境下的决策问题提供了有效的解决方案，同时具有广泛的适用性和较高的性能表现。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: FADE基于理论分析保证了界定的遗憾和参数一致性，实验验证了其跨模式和偏移强度的鲁棒性，为动态环境下的稳健学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL显著改善了RL任务的训练性能和可靠性，并证实其在Ascend超算平台上的强大性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Conclusion: ProGMLP为GNN-to-MLP知识蒸馏提供了灵活、动态的推理成本与性能权衡方案，适合多种应用场景部署。

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

*Eva van Tegelen,George van Voorn,Ioannis Athanasiadis,Peter van Heijster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何通过神经常微分方程（Neural ODEs）预测动态系统中的分岔行为，克服机器学习方法局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多动态系统可能会经历重大转变或分岔，预测这些分岔对于对复杂系统理解和管理至关重要。然而，以往的预测研究通常局限于离散时间模型和局部分岔的研究。

Method: 本文提出了一个基于神经常微分方程（Neural ODEs）的连续数据驱动方法，可以利用时间序列数据学习系统动力学并识别分岔结构。应用对象为具有局部和全局分岔的捕食-被捕食系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，神经ODE模型可以从时间序列数据中重构参数相关的向量场，从而直接学习分岔结构。模型还可预测超出训练数据参数范围的分岔。

Conclusion: 神经ODEs能够在有限和含噪数据条件下依然发挥作用，其准确性主要依赖于从训练数据中提取信息的质量，而非单纯数据量。这为动态系统分岔行为预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个称为Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC)的新框架，通过系统性地从输入训练数据中推断储存器网络结构，并利用可见性图(VG)技术进行转换，以实现时间序列预测的准确性和计算效率。

Motivation: 传统的深度学习方法需要高计算成本，而随机储存器架构往往导致网络性能不佳。研究的目的是开发一种既能高效又有针对性的储存器计算模型，从输入时间序列数据中直接学习网络结构。

Method: 研究使用了可见性图(VG)技术，将时间序列数据转化为网络结构，并利用此网络直接构建储存器，避免了超参数调节。

Result: 相比于同样大小、谱半径和密度的Erdős-Rényi图结构，所提出的DyRC-VG方法在预测质量和表现一致性上更为优异。

Conclusion: DyRC框架结合了动态信息和高效计算能力，为复杂非线性时间序列预测提供了一种可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

Motivation: 现有模型在处理属性缺失图聚类时未能有效捕获类别相关的语义信息，导致聚类效果不理想，同时现有优化策略忽视了某些属性可能与图无关的问题。

Method: 提出了CGIR模型，通过估计子聚类分布和使用生成对抗模块实现节点属性补全，同时设计边注意力网络识别类别相关属性，避免冗余属性干扰。

Result: 实验结果表明，CGIR在多个基准数据集上均优于当前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: CGIR以识别和合并子聚类为核心，将节点补全和优化集成到统一框架中，提高了属性缺失图聚类的精度。

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: GCL-GCN通过创新的模块设计显著提升了节点表示质量和聚类性能，为处理稀疏和异构图数据的聚类任务提供了优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

Conclusion: 该方法为关注隐私的图数据分析提供了一种可行的解决方案，在隐私保护和数据效用上达成了良好平衡，具有重要的理论价值和实践意义。

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

Motivation: 提升非小细胞肺癌(NSCLC)的早期诊断率，从而改善患者的预后。

Method: 收集227名受试者的咳嗽音频记录，利用支持向量机(SVM)、XGBoost、卷积神经网络(CNN)及迁移学习(VGG16)等机器学习和深度学习技术进行分析，同时通过SHAP评估模型的可解释性，并进行不同年龄和性别群体间的公平性分析。

Result: CNN达到了测试集上最高的准确率0.83，而SVM在计算资源有限的情况下也表现良好（测试集准确率0.78）。

Conclusion: 自动咳嗽分析显示了区分NSCLC患者和健康个体的潜力，但需要更大规模、更多样化的数据集验证模型可靠性及进一步提升公平性。

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

Conclusion: 通道异质性是VLSI物理布局分析中的关键归纳偏置，证明了所提出方法的显著有效性。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

Conclusion: 物理引导的图神经网络在资源受限的触发系统中展示了强大的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在生成合成表格数据时难以保留属性之间的功能依赖和逻辑依赖，这是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 提出一个分层特征生成框架（HFGF），先用常见生成模型生成独立特征，再依据预定义的FD和LD规则重建依赖特征。

Result: 在四个包含不同规模、特征不平衡和依赖复杂性的数据集上的实验表明，HFGF在六种生成模型中有效提升了FDs和LDs的保留。

Conclusion: HFGF可以显著提高合成表格数据的结构保真度和下游实用性。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于组件的机器学习（CBML）代理建模方法，快速预测室内气流和温度分布，替代传统计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的CFD模拟计算量大，无法满足实时和设计迭代需求，因此需要一种高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用三个神经网络构建CBML模型：具有残差连接的卷积自编码器（CAER）用于提取和压缩流动特征，多层感知机（MLP）映射入口速度到潜在表示，以及卷积神经网络（CNN）聚合单入口特征至双入口场景。

Result: 所提模型能够快速准确地预测室内速度和温度场分布，在训练和测试数据集中均表现出色。

Conclusion: CBML模型成功替代传统CFD模拟，为室内环境预测提供了一种快速且高效的方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

TL;DR: SPADA提出了一种轻量级生成框架，通过稀疏依赖关系的方式改善表格数据增强，同时减少了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在许多领域中至关重要，但因隐私问题和数据收集成本的限制，高质量数据集稀缺。现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的数据增强方法存在引入偏差和计算开销大的问题。

Method: SPADA通过构建由LLM生成的图表，显式捕捉稀疏依赖关系并以图的遍历方式进行数据生成。提出两种数据合成策略：非参数方法（基于高斯核密度估计）和条件正态流模型。

Result: 实验表明，SPADA生成的表格数据约束违规情况比扩散方法减少了4%，并且相比LLM基线方法加速了近9500倍。

Conclusion: SPADA有效解决了现有表格数据增强模型的偏差和高计算开销问题，同时兼顾生成质量和效率，具有较高的应用潜力。

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

Method: 提出使用微调的多模态视觉-语言模型进行视频检索，用以应对短视频推荐系统的交互数据有限性、位置偏差和时长偏差等问题。

Result: 在线实验结果表明，与传统的有监督学习方法相比，该方法在电商平台上的效果更好。

Conclusion: 利用多模态视觉-语言模型的解决方案能更好地克服新短视频推荐的挑战，提升用户体验和推荐效果。

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: GENEO方法利用领域特定的不变性，有效克服数据稀疏问题，为6G网络中的SINR图重建提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,
and outlines promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

TL;DR: SILS框架通过引入流动性稳定影响评分（LSIS）和指数时间加权流动性（ETWL），以更准确地分析去中心化金融中的流动性提供者（LP）影响，比传统方法更深入且实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过资本大小或表面活动衡量流动性提供者，但其结果往往导向错误的风险分析，因而需要更动态和影响导向的方法。

Method: SILS框架通过链上数据计算ETWL档案并应用异常检测技术，并结合LSIS这一反事实指标，衡量某LP退出对市场的潜在影响。

Result: SILS框架能够精准识别传统方法无法捕捉的高影响力流动性提供者，同时减少常见的假阳性和揭示关键假阴性情况。

Conclusion: SILS框架大幅提升了DeFi生态的透明度和风险管理能力，为市场稳定和交易信号生成提供了更可靠的支持，是对现有分析方法的重大改进。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

Motivation: 长上下文推理任务中，现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在解码阶段硬件效率较低，需要一种新方法降低计算成本。

Result: 与现有的DeepSeek-V3和Qwen3 MoE 235B模型相比，Step-3具有更低的解码成本，尤其在长上下文场景中表现更加显著。在Hopper GPU的实现中，Step-3达到每张GPU每秒4039个Token的解码吞吐量，大幅领先于DeepSeek-V3的2324。

Conclusion: 通过硬件协同优化设计，Step-3在解码性能和成本上达到了前所未有的水准，成为LLM解码领域的新标杆。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) 的方法，专注于提升随机森林模型的可解释性，通过聚类提供局部和全局的结构化洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在敏感应用中的广泛使用，需求提出了更加可解释和可信的决策工具。而随机森林虽然表现优异，但由于其集成特性难以解释。

Method: 提出了Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC)，该方法根据数据点的共享决策路径进行聚类，并计算特定于聚类和全局的特征重要性评分。

Result: FGC在基准数据集中准确恢复了潜在子类结构，优于传统聚类和后处理解释方法；在AML转录组数据集上揭示了生物学一致的子群，并解析出与疾病相关的信号与混杂变量。

Conclusion: FGC方法不仅提供了特征层面的归因，还能通过结构意识的洞察弥补性能与可解释性之间的缺口。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

*Maria Zaitseva,Ivan Tomilov,Natalia Gusarova*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过“梯度丢弃”增强前向神经网络（FFNN）抗噪能力的方法，同时结合有噪目标变量，这种方法在一些数据集上表现出显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFNN在面对输入噪声时易受影响，现有方法往往忽略了神经元间的交互或改变了网络架构，因此需要一种更有效的抗噪方法。

Method: 通过修改反向传播，将其解释为多智能体博弈，引入“梯度丢弃”技术（在反向传播中以1-p的概率选择性地清零隐藏层神经元的梯度）和加入噪声的目标变量。

Result: 实验表明，在10个不同的数据集上，方法的效果与数据集和超参数选择有关；尤其是在回归任务中，梯度丢弃与稳定分布目标噪声的组合显著提高了对输入噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 此方法展现出提升网络抗噪能力的潜力，强调了自适应参数调整的重要性，并为利用博弈论框架分析神经网络提供了新视角。

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing
prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often
alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to
enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a
multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our
"gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with
probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active.
This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables
were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten
diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of
robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on
regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution
target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by
flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the
method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning,
and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems
exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual
Networks (ResNets) for automatically diagnosing paediatric pneumonia on chest
X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.

Result: 方法显著减少图像重建时间（减少两个数量级），提高图像质量，并实现多光谱重建。

Conclusion: 该方法改进了单像素荧光显微成像，成本低廉，可推动诊断和生物研究的发展。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射治疗的针重建需要手动标注影像中的针位置，这一过程费时费力，自动化解决方案需要应对分割深度学习模型的误差。

Method: 在针重建任务中，采用两阶段方法：分割和后处理，并提出了改进现有后处理技术的适应性方案，以更好地处理分割误差。

Conclusion: 基于针分割后改进的后处理技术有效提升了针重建的精度，验证了对分割误差的管理能力，适用于自动化的放射治疗计划。

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

Motivation: 现有去噪方法通常依赖噪声特性或图像上下文信息，且多为单一成像模式和噪声类型设计。本研究旨在开发一种适用于多种成像方法和噪声类型的通用去噪模型。

Method: DPL模型通过双路径架构分别整合噪声特性和图像上下文信息，并结合生成最终去噪结果。

Result: DPL模型在多种成像模式和噪声类型下表现出较强的鲁棒性和广泛的适用性，相较基线UNet，在高斯噪声下的PSNR提高3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL模型成功实现了多种医学成像去噪任务的显著性能提升，为医学图像分析和诊断提供了更好的辅助工具。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

Conclusion: HPCM方法有效提升了图像压缩任务中的上下文建模效率，为长程依赖与多样化上下文信息的利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了潜在扩散模型和自回归模型在医学成像生成任务中的优劣，为实际任务选择生成模型提供了参考依据。

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Method: 利用一个公开的临床基线和随访CT数据集，评估ULS23分割模型的纵向病变追踪能力，并通过人为偏移输入体积进行对模型性能的系统探索。

Result: 发现单时间点模型在病变位移时分割准确性显著下降，并暴露出登记错误和病变对准失败的两大关键问题。

Conclusion: 需从单一工具向端到端集成模型转变，以应对纵向分析的需求并支持鲁棒的肿瘤追踪。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.
