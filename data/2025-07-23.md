### [1] [Salience Adjustment for Context-Based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15878)
*Bin Han,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究动态社会语境中的情绪识别，提出结合贝叶斯线索集成（BCI）和视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的框架，通过根据面部线索的显著性动态加权面部和上下文信息以改进识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情绪识别需要同时理解面部表情与情境线索的复杂交互，以实现更准确的动态情绪理解。

Method: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯线索集成（BCI）和视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的框架，将面部和情景信息根据显著性调整动态加权。

Result: 在“囚徒困境”场景中进行评估，发现显著性调整可以提高情绪识别的性能。

Conclusion: 显著性调整在情绪识别中有效，为将该框架扩展到更广泛的社会情境和多模态应用提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts requires an understanding of
the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. This
paper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion
recognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models
(VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the
expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations
and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios,
which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that
incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to
broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

### [2] [Document Haystack: A Long Context Multimodal Image/Document Understanding Vision LLM Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15882)
*Goeric Huybrechts,Srikanth Ronanki,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Jack Fitzgerald,Srinivasan Veeravanallur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究引入了Document Haystack，一种专门为评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)在处理长文档中的表现的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在分析复杂多模态数据方面取得了显著进展，但处理长文档这一方面研究不足，缺乏合适的评估基准。

Method: 提出了Document Haystack基准，包含从5至200页的长文档，并在文档中插入纯文本或多模态的文字+图像困难点，以评估VLMs的检索能力。

Result: Document Haystack基准包含了400个文档变体和8,250个问题，并通过一个客观、自动化的评估框架支持，对VLMs的表现进行了测评。

Conclusion: 研究展示了Document Haystack的构建和其应用可能性，为长文档处理提出了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly
advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from
different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains
under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this,
we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is
supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the
construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present
results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this
area.

### [3] [PAT++: a cautionary tale about generative visual augmentation for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15888)
*Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira,Arathy Jeevan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨生成式数据增强在对象再识别任务中的有效性，发现现行生成模型在保留细粒度身份特征方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式数据增强在某些视觉任务中得到成效，但其在需要保留细粒度视觉细节的对象再识别任务中的应用尚未被深入研究。

Method: 提出了名为PAT++的新型流水线，将扩散自蒸馏技术融入已建立的部件感知Transformer中，并在Urban Elements ReID Challenge数据集上开展实验。

Result: 实验表明，由于领域偏移和无法保留定义身份的关键特征，生成图像在训练和查询扩展中导致一致的性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明，生成模型在细粒度识别任务中的可转移性存在局限，同时暴露了当前生成方法在身份保留应用中的关键局限性。

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

### [4] [Local Dense Logit Relations for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15911)
*Liuchi Xu,Kang Liu,Jinshuai Liu,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为LDRLD的新型蒸馏方法，结合递归解耦与重组技术，同时通过引入ADW策略提升性能，展示了比以往更佳的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的logit蒸馏方法在细粒度的类间关系上研究不足，需深入挖掘并提升学生模型性能。

Method: 开发了LDRLD方法，通过递归解耦与重组获取类间细粒度关系，同时引入ADW策略动态调整关键类别的权重，利用IRW反向排名权重与ERD指数权重衰减机制优化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-1K及Tiny-ImageNet数据集上进行了大量实验，性能优于现有logit蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度知识转移与关键关系强化，显著提升学生模型的学习性能，且简洁高效。

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

### [5] [An empirical study for the early detection of Mpox from skin lesion images using pretrained CNN models leveraging XAI technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15915)
*Mohammad Asifur Rahim,Muhammad Nazmul Arefin,Md. Mizanur Rahman,Md Ali Hossain,Ahmed Moustafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用预训练的卷积神经网络（CNN）模型（如VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2）和Grad-CAM技术检测猴痘的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 猴痘病毒与其他皮肤病难以区分，准确的早期诊断具有挑战性，因此需要探索人工智能和深度学习在猴痘检测中的作用。

Method: 对两个数据集（MSLD和MSLD v2.0）通过迁移学习调整CNN模型的初始层，并添加自定义层以适应猴痘检测。使用Grad-CAM可视化关键特征，采用指标评估模型性能。

Result: InceptionV3在二分类数据集中取得95%准确率，MobileNetV2在多分类数据集中表现最佳，达到93%准确率。Grad-CAM成功可视化了关键图像区域，但部分模型存在过拟合倾向。

Conclusion: 预训练CNN模型在猴痘检测中具有潜力，XAI技术可增强解释性，但需解决数据集限制及尝试多模态数据和新增解释技术以提高诊断可靠性与模型透明性。

Abstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency

### [6] [A Lightweight Face Quality Assessment Framework to Improve Face Verification Performance in Real-Time Screening Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15961)
*Ahmed Aman Ibrahim,Hamad Mansour Alawar,Abdulnasser Abbas Zehi,Ahmed Mohammad Alkendi,Bilal Shafi Ashfaq Ahmed Mirza,Shan Ullah,Ismail Lujain Jaleel,Hassan Ugail*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个轻量级自动人脸质量评估框架，通过过滤低质量人脸图像，大幅提升了人脸验证系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低质量人脸图像会导致人脸验证模型的性能显著下降，目标是设计一个能够提高验证准确性和可靠性的质量评估方法。

Method: 利用归一化面部标志点和随机森林回归分类器来评估图像质量，并与ArcFace模型整合以优化性能。

Result: 实验表明该框架实现了96.67%的评估准确率，99.7%的拒真率下降，同时提升了余弦相似度，尤其适用于处理实际监控场景中的低质量图像。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了框架在提高人脸验证效率和应对实际挑战中的优越表现，优于现有方法且具备计算效率。

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

### [7] [FW-VTON: Flattening-and-Warping for Person-to-Person Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16010)
*Zheng Wang,Xianbing Sun,Shengyi Wu,Jiahui Zhan,Jianlou Si,Chi Zhang,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为FW-VTON的新方法，用于实现人与人之间的虚拟试衣。其创新点在于仅利用目标人物和穿着服饰的另一人物的图像完成任务，且其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注服饰到人体的试穿，要求平面服饰表示，而人对人试穿任务特别需要解决目标人和已穿着服饰人物的结合问题。

Method: 方法包括三阶段：从来源图像中提取平面服饰；将服饰与目标姿势对齐变形；将服饰与目标人物无缝集成。并提出新数据集以应对高质量数据缺乏的问题。

Result: 实验表明，FW-VTON在定性和定量评估中表现出色，并在服饰提取子任务中具有领先性能。

Conclusion: FW-VTON为人对人虚拟试衣任务提供了一个高效的新方法，具有优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

*Matteo Dunnhofer,Zaira Manigrasso,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了第一人称视觉中视觉对象跟踪与分割任务的挑战来源，提出了一种新型评估方法以区分视角独特性与领域属性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解第一人称视觉中跟踪与分割的性能下降是否来源于第一人称视角的独特性，还是人-物体活动领域的通用挑战。

Method: 通过新评估策略区分挑战来源，将第一人称视角与人-物体活动理解的领域特性分开分析。

Result: 提供了对第一人称视觉任务主要困难来源的更深入理解。

Conclusion: 研究结果帮助更有针对性地提升第一人称视觉的目标跟踪与分割任务性能。

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉Transformer中的大规模token和伪造token的现象，并提出了一种无需训练的快速注意力方法和掩码策略，从而在降低计算复杂度的同时提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前视觉Transformer的内部机制理解不足，因此研究其特性和现象有助于优化和创新设计。

Method: 通过研究大规模token和伪造token的相互作用规律，提出了Fast Nyström Attention方法，用于线性近似自注意力机制。同时还提出掩码策略来减弱这些token带来的噪声。

Result: 在多个视觉任务中，包括检索、分类、分割和视觉问答，方法在减少计算开销的同时，展现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer中token的作用机制，通过新的方法和策略优化了Transformer模型的性能及推理效率。

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

### [10] [Discovering and using Spelke segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16038)
*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种基于物理运动关系（Spelke Object）的视觉分段方法，提出了SpelkeBench数据集和SpelkeNet模型，并在强化图像对象操作能力方面展现了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机视觉分段方法往往依赖于语义和类别特定的规则，而人类认知中的Spelke对象基于物理因果关系进行分组，可能更适用于操控和规划任务。

Method: 论文创建了SpelkeBench数据集，定义了Spelke对象的概念；设计了SpelkeNet模型，通过预测未来运动分布生成运动可操作性图和期望位移图，结合统计反事实探测法提取Spelke分段。

Result: 实验表明，SpelkeNet在SpelkeBench数据集上表现优于监督式基线模型如SegmentAnything (SAM)。此外，Spelke对象的使用显著提升了在3DEditBench基准上的物理操作性能。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了Spelke对象在任务中的实际适用性，提出的模型和方法可提升视觉分段和对象操控能力，为此领域的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

### [11] [Disrupting Semantic and Abstract Features for Better Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16052)
*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了对抗样本转移能力的提升，提出了一种新方法，整合语义和高频特征进行干扰，提升对抗样本的传递性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，对抗样本在黑箱环境中的转移性引发了人们对深度神经网络安全性的关注。本文旨在针对现有特征级攻击中局限于语义信息的处理，探索增强转移能力的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为SAFER的新方法，通过在输入图像上进行BLOCKMIX操作以及在频谱中进行SELF-MIX操作来计算特征权重矩阵并指导攻击。这种方法能够同时干扰语义和抽象特征，从而增强对抗样本的传递性。

Result: 基于ImageNet数据集的大量实验结果显示，该方法有效增强了对抗样本的传递性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAFER方法结合了语义和抽象特征的干扰策略，为增强黑箱环境中对抗样本的转移性提供了一种有效解决方案，在实际应用中具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

### [12] [Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095)
*Parul Gupta,Abhinav Dhall,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过反馈机制改进个性化图像生成的系统，可以提升复杂活动生成质量，保持参考人物身份以及实现自然的人物注视模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有个性化图像生成中在复杂活动生成、不正确人物姿势、身份保留以及注视模式自然性方面的不足。

Method: 采用反馈机制，对现有的个性化生成方法进行微调。具体地，引入最先进的姿势检测、人机交互检测、人脸识别及注视点估计算法，并根据信号类型在不同时间步注入低级或高级反馈模块。

Result: 产生的图像在交互动作、人物身份保留及整体图像质量上，在三个基准数据集上均有提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于反馈的微调方法可以有效改善生成图像的多方面表现，为个性化图像生成提供了一种先进的改进路径。

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频扩散模型范式Pusa，通过向量化时间步长调整实现精细的时间控制，超越以往方法在效率和性能上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频扩散模型在时间建模上受限于标量时间步长变量的刚性同步，导致计算效率低下、遗忘问题或适用范围狭窄，这推动了作者寻找新的解决方法。

Method: 作者设计了Pusa框架，其核心是向量化时间步长调整，这是一种非破坏性适配方法，能够在保持基础模型能力的同时引入时间动态变化。

Result: Pusa显著提高了效率，训练成本仅为传统方法的1/200，数据集需求为其1/2500，同时性能超越Wan-I2V-14B，达到VBench-I2V得分87.32%。此外，Pusa还具备零样本多任务能力，例如处理起始帧和视频扩展等任务。

Conclusion: Pusa为下一代视频合成提供了一个高效、可扩展且通用的范式，具有革命性的意义，并将高保真视频生成的门槛显著降低，为科研和工业界所用。代码已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为LongSplat的在线实时3D高斯重建方法，通过增量更新与冗余压缩机制解决长序列图像处理中的高效性与存储问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法在长序列场景中的效率不足，缺乏快速增量更新能力，影响了连续性处理性能。

Method: 通过引入一种流式更新机制结合Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR)，实现当前视图与历史数据的融合和冗余压缩，并利用图像压缩技术优化3D高斯质量与密度。

Result: 实验表明，相较于现有方法，LongSplat能够在保证实时重建的同时，将高斯数量减少44%。

Conclusion: LongSplat在实时新视图合成中实现了效率与质量的平衡，突破了传统方法的性能瓶颈，为长序列重建任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Result: 提供了一个包含不同模态的Spiking数据集，为精确、低功耗视频理解提供了一个独特的实验平台。

Conclusion: 该数据集推动基于Spiking数据的低能耗动作识别研究，具有重要的实际应用意义。

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will
drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding,
specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在像素空间进行缩放时带来的失真和伪影问题，以及重新编码潜空间导致画质下降的问题。

Method: 提出 Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen)，通过轻量级潜空间上采样器直接在潜空间中进行分辨率缩放，同时保留 Transformer 或 U-Net 架构不变。

Result: LSSGen 在文本-图像对齐和感知质量方面显著优于传统方法，生成 $1024^2$ 图像时以相似速度达成最高 246% 的 TOPIQ 分数提升。

Conclusion: LSSGen 的框架在提高效率的同时提升了生成图像的视觉质量，并支持灵活的多分辨率图像生成。

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

Conclusion: AMMNet通过有效的非对称设计与模态对准，显著提升了RGB-DSM多模态语义分割的效率与精度，特别适用于复杂城市环境。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AtrousMamba模型，结合了精细化局部特征提取与全局上下文信息整合，在多个数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在Mamba模型中有效整合局部信息与全局上下文以提升密集预测任务的表现。

Method: 提出一种基于扩张窗口的选择性扫描机制（AWVSS模块），逐步扩大扫描范围，同时调整步伐以更好捕捉局部细节特征和全局上下文。此外，设计出专用于二值变化检测（BCD）和语义变化检测（SCD）的端到端Mamba框架。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验显示，AtrousMamba框架在性能上优于现有的CNN、Transformer和Mamba方法。

Conclusion: AtrousMamba不仅能捕捉视觉数据中的长程依赖，还能有效保留细粒度的局部细节。

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

TL;DR: RSTrack提出了三种机制来改善视觉跟踪中的时序一致性问题，并在多个数据集上达到了先进性能，同时保持了实时运行速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流跟踪算法在上下文关联上缺乏明确监督，难以有效建模目标动态演化。

Method: 提出RSTrack，包含三大核心机制：1. 上下文推理机制，构建目标状态推理管道；2. 正向监督策略，以真实目标特征作为锚点；3. 高效状态建模，压缩和重构目标核心特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，RSTrack在多个基准数据集上实现了先进的性能表现，并维持了实时速度。

Conclusion: RSTrack通过显式建模和监督上下文推理过程，有效缓解了传统时序建模中的关联发散问题，展现了极大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

Conclusion: EBench-18K基准及LMM4Edit指标提供了高效且符合感知的文本指导图像编辑评测方式，为此领域研究与发展铺垫了新的方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

Conclusion: 研究所提出的方法不仅解决了因指纹图像质量低导致配准失败的问题，还提升了指纹注册的整体性能，有显著的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，模型在多类与不同难度级别上表现出色，验证了其稳定性能。

Conclusion: LDRFusion优先利用可靠的LiDAR数据生成提案，在融合伪点云后实现性能提升，有效应对多传感器融合中的噪声问题。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D
object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our
framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories
and difficulty levels.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite
imagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by
geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
existing MLLMs on our dataset yields significant performance improvements for

Conclusion: SSCU框架通过设计动态样式记忆与协作训练，有效提升了人重识别联邦领域泛化性能，对广泛样式的利用具有显著作用与实际价值。

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

Conclusion: HoliTracer框架有效解决了大规模遥感影像上下文信息丢失问题，为地理对象高精度矢量化提供了新方法。

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and
data are available in https://github.com/vvangfaye/HoliTracer.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges
to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Token Freezing and Reusing (ToFe)的新框架，通过冻结不重要的tokens并在后续阶段重新利用，显著减少了计算成本，同时保持模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉变换器因自注意力计算开销大，难以部署在资源有限的设备上。现有的token减缩方法无法管理不重要token的再利用，限制了效率的进一步提升。本研究目标是改进此问题，并使模型在性能和计算资源消耗间取得平衡。

Method: 提出了一种ToFe框架，通过设计一个预测模块来识别重要token，并通过一个近似模块恢复被冻结的token，再结合计算预算感知的端到端训练优化，从而在每个阶段自适应处理必要token。

Result: ToFe框架在LV-ViT模型中减少了50%的计算成本，同时Top-1准确率仅下降不到2%，在性能与复杂度平衡方面优于目前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ToFe框架通过冻结和延时复用token的方法，在减少计算开销的同时有效地维持了性能，拓宽了视觉变换器在资源受限设备上的应用可能性。

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 深度学习传统依赖于端到端反向传播，但存在更新锁定、高内存消耗和生物学可行性差等问题。本文提出MAN++，通过引入动态交互机制和可学习的偏差缩放来改进局部学习。实验表明，MAN++在性能上接近端到端训练，但显著降低了GPU内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端反向传播的局限性，如更新锁定、高内存需求和生物学不合理性，同时提高监督局部学习的性能。

Method: 提出了MAN++，使用参数的指数移动平均值（EMA）增强网络块间通信，并引入可学习的偏差缩放来平衡特征差异。

Result: MAN++在分类、检测和分割等任务中表现出与端到端训练可比的性能，同时大幅降低了GPU内存的使用。

Conclusion: MAN++为监督局部学习提供了新视角，是传统训练方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA)框架，通过利用大语言模型(LLM)深入剖析动作标签中的本质特征，将视频和文本信息结合，在少样本的动作识别任务中实现了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本动作识别（FSAR）任务由于训练样本稀缺，难以有效理解动作中细微的姿态、运动动态和对象交互，研究需求驱动加入文本等额外模态以弥补信息不足。

Method: 提出LGA框架：1）通过LLM将动作标签解剖为包括主体、运动、对象三部分的原子动作描述；2）为视频引入视觉解剖模块，分解动作为原子视频阶段；3）结合细粒度视频和文本特征，并引入多模态匹配机制（视频-视频、视频-文本）。

Result: 实验表明，LGA在多个少样本动作识别基准上达到了最新最优性能。

Conclusion: 将LLM和视频解剖相结合的LGA框架能够有效提取动作的核心时空线索，显著提升少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

Result: Dens3R成功回归多种几何量，并在多个3D预测任务上性能优异。

Conclusion: Dens3R在单视图到多视图输入中均表现出一致的几何感知优势，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

Motivation: 现有的文本生成视频方法难以在参考对象和目标对象外观或结构差异显著时实现流畅的动作迁移。

Method: 引入MotionShot框架，首先通过语义特征匹配确保参考和目标对象的高层对齐，然后通过参考到目标的形状重定向建立低层次的形态对齐，并通过时间注意力对动作进行编码。

Result: MotionShot在显著外观和结构差异的对象之间演示了连贯的动作迁移，实验效果显著。

Conclusion: MotionShot框架在无需训练的情况下，实现了在差异较大的对象之间的高忠实度和连贯性的动作迁移。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

Conclusion: M-SpecGene整合了分散研究，提供了一种统一的视角与方法，为多光谱融合带来新的见解。

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text
Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for

Motivation: 现有方法由于形态多样性、领域转移以及对大规模标注的依赖，难以完美解决息肉分割问题。近期出现的SAM模型的适用性尽管较强，但其提示依赖性限制了自动化应用的潜力。

Method: 该研究提出了基于SAM的OP-SAM框架，包括相关性先验生成（CPG）、比例级联先验融合（SPF）和欧几里得提示进化（EPE），分别用于语义标注转移、处理尺寸变化与噪声以及提示迭代优化。

Conclusion: OP-SAM框架在减少标注负担的同时显著提升了息肉分割的准确性和通用性，为医学应用自动化带来了可能。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.

Conclusion: FRVD 能够解决大范围姿态变化带来的问题，为高质量人脸重演提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.

Motivation: 现有任务面临标签不平衡、正负样本稀疏、对时间预测精确性要求高以及实际运行中的计算效率问题，因此需要设计一种解决这些问题的模型。

Method: 提出Mamba-OTR模型，基于Mamba架构，通过利用时间递归特性并结合短视频片段训练，同时引入focal loss和新型正则化方法处理标签不平衡问题。

Result: 相比于基础模型，Mamba-OTR在不同任务模式下显著提高了精度（滑动窗口模式下的mp-mAP为45.48，流式模式下为43.35），并优于传统transformer模型和原版Mamba。

Conclusion: Mamba-OTR不仅在性能上表现出众，特别在高帧率或完整视频段的评估中，同时具有较高的计算效率，是OTR任务的强力基线，研究团队将开源代码以支持后续研究。

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our
method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method and the value of our dataset. Code and models are available

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原理和创新策略有效提升了点云配准的质量与效率，相关代码公开提供。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity (e.g., fMRI) bridges
neuroscience and computer vision by decoding neural representations. However,
existing methods often overlook critical brain structure-function
relationships, flattening spatial information and neglecting individual
anatomical variations. To address these issues, we propose (1) a novel sphere
tokenizer that explicitly models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D
spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,
and generalizability across individuals. Experiments demonstrate superior
reconstruction performance compared to SOTA methods, highlighting the
effectiveness and interpretability of our biologically informed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别系统面临攻击演示带来的安全威胁，现有深度学习方法难以处理未知攻击并缺乏泛化能力，因此需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 通过评估基础模型在不同实验场景中的表现，提出了一种简单有效的零样本攻击检测框架，并在复杂数据库和未知攻击下测试其性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在困难情景下展示了优异性能，显著超过了现有方法，尤其在SiW-Mv2数据库中的未知2D和3D攻击下表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究表明基础模型在零样本攻击检测上具有较强的泛化能力，新框架为提高面部识别系统的安全性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

Result: 在五种失真类型下，伪造定位性能平均提升20.79%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADCD-Net成功提升了文档伪造检测的准确性和鲁棒性，具有实用价值。

Abstract: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.

Conclusion: 该综述提供了几何方法、隐式神经方法及生成模型方法的统一视角，指出在领域泛化与无位置信息重建方面的持续挑战，并提出了发展3D生成先验与实现实时稀疏视角重建的未来方向。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly
increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms

However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available
real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new

state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed
for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the
transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection. Experimental results
demonstrate promising performance, highlighting the effectiveness of synthetic
datasets and domain adaptation techniques in advancing perception capabilities

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望改进图像分类器的监督学习过程，通过软增强方法提高训练样本的标注鲁棒性。

Method: 通过扩展自适应标签平滑框架，将其应用于随机擦除和噪声注入等数据增强方式，并分析其在不同图像变换情景下的表现。

Result: 自适应标签平滑在单一类型的图像变换中有效，但在多样化变换（如TrivialAugment）中效果减弱，且过度的标签平滑降低了对常见损坏的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自适应标签平滑的方法更适合用于数据分布以单一、同质图像变换为主的场景。

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for
autonomous driving scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出DenseSR方法以解决单幅图像阴影去除问题，尤其是在间接光照下的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法难以同时恢复阴影细节和锐利边界，导致不一致的还原效果和模糊问题。

Method: 提出DenseSR框架，通过几何-语义先验指导深度场景理解和具有创新性Dense Fusion Block (DFB)的解码器进行高保真恢复。

Result: 实验结果显示DenseSR在阴影去除的质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DenseSR有效解决了不一致的还原和模糊问题，对阴影区域的细节恢复和边界锐化具有显著优势。

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

Result: 在TCGA-KIRC数据上取得了C-index为0.712，Brier评分为0.254；在TCGA-LUAD数据上C-index为0.645，Brier评分为0.281，均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法展现了在不同癌症类型中预测生存率的可行性与准确性潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method
across diverse cancer types.

TL;DR: 提出Zebra-CoT数据集，解决多模态模型中视觉逻辑推理链相关的挑战，改善性能并支持研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉策略链（Visual Chain of Thought, Visual CoT）表现欠佳且缺乏高质量的数据，因此很难训练以解决复杂问题。从人类利用视觉辅助具启发性。

Method: 构建大型多样化数据集Zebra-CoT，包含182,384个逻辑连贯的文本-图像推理实例，并针对包括科学问题、视觉任务、3D推理和战略游戏等多类任务进行跨模型微调以验证其有效性。

Result: 通过对Anole-7B模型的微调，在测试集准确率上提高了12%，同时在标准多模态基准测试中性能提升达13%；微调Bagel-7B成功生成高质量的视觉推理链。

Conclusion: Zebra-CoT证明了其在提升多模态推理能力方面的有效性，并通过开源数据集和模型推动相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

Motivation: 植物标本图像分类受背景异质性影响，导致噪声和伪影降低分类准确性，需要解决此问题以优化性能。

Method: 提出了PlantSAM，其中YOLOv10生成用于引导SAM2的边界框提示，两者均针对标本图像进行微调，然后通过IoU和Dice系数评估性能。

Result: PlantSAM达到了最先进的分割性能，IoU为0.94，Dice系数为0.97。分类准确性提升可达4.36%，F1分数提高4.15%。

Conclusion: 背景去除对标本图像分析至关重要，可显著提高分类模型的准确性，使其更专注于植物前景结构。

Abstract: Deep learning-based classification of herbarium images is hampered by
background heterogeneity, which introduces noise and artifacts that can
potentially mislead models and reduce classification accuracy. Addressing these
background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We
introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10
for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for
segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing
segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and
evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics.
PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of
0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into
classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five
tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score
improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background
removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances
classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the
foreground plant structures.

Result: 实验表明，Spatial 3D-LLM在多种3D视觉语言任务中达到了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 证明了逐步空间意识方案能够显著改善模型对深层空间信息的捕获，增强了空间意识和任务处理能力。

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

Motivation: 目前3D生成技术虽然进步显著，但规模化应用到数千平方公里的地理区域建模仍是一个挑战。

Method: 引入全球最大3D航空数据集Aerial-Earth3D，包含5万场景和多视图数据。设计了EarthCrafter框架，使用稀疏解耦的潜变分布方式进行结构生成和纹理生成的分离。

Result: EarthCrafter在超大规模3D生成上表现优异，支持语义引导的城市布局生成和地形合成等多种应用。

Conclusion: 利用大规模数据集和定制模型架构，框架在地理可行性和多样性上均取得了重要进展，推动了3D地球生成的可能性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善基于视觉传感器的检测、跟踪和场景理解系统，提高其精确性和可靠性，尤其是为满足安全关键系统（如ADS）的要求。

Method: 提出了一系列优化技术，包括软硬件任务分布、硬件感知预处理、机器学习模型压缩和完整流水线部署，并用于设计并优化基于FPGA SoC的高光谱图像分割处理器。

Result: 采用模型压缩等技术，将DNN计算复杂度减少至24.34%、参数数量减少至1.02%，在推理任务中实现了2.86倍的速度提升，同时保持分割精度。

Conclusion: 优化后的处理器为边缘环境下的ADS系统提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案，展示了高光谱图像和机器学习结合的潜力。

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.

Motivation: 当下机器人辅助微创手术中，如何在真实场景下提高手术器械识别的鲁棒性是一个关键难题，本文旨在通过引入手术上下文信息来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了PhaKIR子挑战，并提供一套多中心的数据集，其中包含从三家医院采集的腹腔镜胆囊切除手术全程视频，用于手术阶段识别、器械关键点估计以及器械实例分割的联合任务研究，同时集成了程序的时间信息。

Result: 报告了PhaKIR挑战的研究结果，并依据BIAS指南进行详细分析，验证了融合时间信息和上下文的方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PhaKIR子挑战为RAMIS领域开发时间感知和上下文驱动的方法提供了一个独特的基准，同时成为未来外科场景理解研究的高质量资源。

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,
context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support
future research in surgical scene understanding.

Motivation: 当前关于Deepfake鉴别的研究中，分类任务或时间伪造定位任务存在限制性、耗时以及在大规模数据集上扩展的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种多模态偏差感知框架，包括引入跨模态注意机制（MI）以在视觉和音频模态之间测量关联性，以及提出可扩展的偏差感知损失函数（deviation perceiving loss）。

Result: 实验表明，所提框架的有效性与全面性，在多个评估指标上达到了接近全监督方法的效果。

Conclusion: 这种弱监督的方法为定位时间伪造提供了新的思路，解决了当前方法中的一些局限性。

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时解决心肌组织同质性带来的特征提取难题和图像-运动之间的细节损失问题。

Method: 提出了动态3D高斯表示法（Dyna3DGR），结合了显式的3D高斯表示和隐式神经运动场建模，通过自监督学习优化心脏结构与运动，并使用可微渲染实现连续运动表示与图像对齐。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上的综合评估显示，该方法在追踪精度上优于当前最先进的深度学习基于同胚映射的配准方法。

Conclusion: 与现有解决方案相比，Dyna3DGR方法在无监督条件下能够更精确地捕捉4D心脏动态，并极大减少对训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The
code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/Dyna3DGR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要基于对比剂的人类优化掩膜，这在某些条件下不可操作，亟需一种可以从原始数据中提取信息的方法。

Method: CTSL框架采用自监督学习，通过多视图蒸馏策略解耦时空特征，并使用编码本和动态病灶自检测进行特征提取，无需分割掩膜。

Result: CTSL成功捕捉时间依赖和运动模式，预测MACE风险的准确率超过了传统依赖对比剂的方法。

Conclusion: CTSL提供了一种快速、无创的心脏风险评估方案，为临床心脏诊断提供了便捷的解决途径。

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction
from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

Conclusion: ASaRG改进了报告生成的性能，同时具备验证生成报告真实性的能力，并且能与LLaVA的其它改良方案结合使用。

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer和Mamba集成方法缺乏深度交互机制，影响了性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出A2Mamba架构，核心是引入多尺度注意力增强的状态空间模型（MASS），将多尺度注意力图集成到状态空间模型中，通过变体的交叉注意力提升空间依赖和动态建模能力。

Result: A2Mamba在视觉识别任务中超越了此前所有基于ConvNet、Transformer和Mamba的架构。例如，在ImageNet-1K数据集上达到86.1%的顶级准确率，在语义分割与对象检测任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: A2Mamba在视觉识别任务中实现了性能和效率的领先，表明通过深度集成Transformer与Mamba的混合架构具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.

*Shuang Song,Yang Tang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出通过使用针对特定目标地区城市布局设计的合成数据，在测试时重新训练模型，从而改进遥感建模分割的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习在处理不同地理区域数据时表现不佳，主要是由于各地区建筑类型、规模和位置分布的多样性，而获取充分注释的数据十分耗时且难以满足大型模型需求。

Method: 通过利用如OpenStreetMap的地理空间数据生成具有目标地区城市布局特点的高分辨率合成数据，并结合程序建模和基于物理的渲染，创建包含建筑形状、材质及环境光照随机化的训练样本。此外，将这些数据融入对抗性领域自适应框架来实现建筑分割。

Result: 实验表明，与传统方法相比，该方法能够显著提高性能，域间差距减少时中值性能提升可达12％。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合部分地理知识与合成影像，提供了一种无需大量真实世界注释的解决方案，不仅具有可扩展性和成本效益，还能有效解决完全依赖合成数据的模型崩溃问题，从而增强遥感建筑分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的四元数Retinex理论，可以有效改进低光图像的颜色忠实度、噪声处理及反射稳定性，并在多种任务中表现出较好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服经典Retinex模型在处理低光图像时的局限性，如独立处理RGB通道、缺乏神经科学模型、无法完美重建图像以及不能解释人类颜色恒常性的问题。

Method: 作者引入了首个四元数Retinex方法，将场景表示为四元数反射率与照明的哈密顿积，并提出反射率一致性指数用于评估反射率的不变性。

Result: 在低光裂缝检测、多光照条件下的人脸检测、红外可见光融合等任务中，该方法比现有领先方法的性能提升了2-11%，并表现出更好的颜色忠实度、更低噪声和更高的反射率稳定性。

Conclusion: 新提出的四元数Retinex模型解决了传统Retinex方法的四点局限，显著提升了低光图像中颜色和噪声性能，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为MpGI的方法，通过多视角生成和整合生成高质量的遥感图像文本描述，从而构建了包含约21万张遥感图像及130万条描述的HQRS-IT-210K数据集，并在此基础上改进了两种基础模型：HQRS-CLIP和RS-CoCa，显著提升了下游任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遥感图像语言模型受限于低质量、简单生成的图像-文本数据集，导致性能提升有限且需要大量训练数据。

Method: 研究提出了两阶段MpGI方法，首先通过多模态大语言模型生成多视角描述，然后利用大型语言模型整合这些描述生成高质量的图像文本描述，最终构建了HQRS-IT-210K数据集，并基于此微调CLIP和CoCa模型。

Result: 改进后的HQRS-CLIP模型以仅使用4.2%的训练数据超越了现有遥感CLIP模型在多个下游任务中的表现，RS-CoCa模型在多个基准数据集上的表现也显著优于现有方法，并能生成超过人工标注质量的图像描述。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了遥感图像语言模型的性能，解决了高质量数据匮乏的问题，为遥感图像相关任务提供了更好的工具和资源。

Abstract: The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的任务方法，称为时间约束的视频推理分割，用于解决现有视频分割方法无法动态识别时序上下文中目标问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分割方法受限于预定义的目标类别，无法处理复杂和动态的场景，例如手术视频分析中的不同工作流和工具变化问题。

Method: 提出了时间约束的视频推理分割任务和一种自动化基准构建方法，并利用MVOR数据集构建了TCVideoRSBenchmark数据集。

Result: 设计并实现了一种时间约束的视频推理分割新方法，并构建了相应的数据集，展示了解决动态相关目标识别问题的潜力。

Conclusion: 新方法为视频分割提供了更灵活的解决方案，特别是适合动态和复杂的场景应用，如手术视频分析。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在集成新的内容和保证修复区与背景在结构和风格上的一致性方面存在挑战。

Method: HarmonPaint利用扩散模型中的自注意力掩码策略来保证结构的完整性，同时无需重新训练或微调模型，并通过扩散模型内在属性将风格信息从非掩码区转移到掩码区。

Result: HarmonPaint在多种场景和风格的实验中表现优异，验证了其通用性与性能。

Conclusion: HarmonPaint证明了其在无需训练的情况下，能够实现高质量、结构融合和风格统一的图像修复。

Abstract: Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning
to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为DFR的创新框架，用于在少样本分割中有效利用多模态信息，通过分解、融合和重建的方法实现了对视觉、文本和音频模态的集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖单一或双模态信息（如视觉样本或文本描述），难以充分利用现实场景中的丰富感知信息。

Method: 提出了DFR框架，包括三个创新点：1）通过SAM提取区域提案及处理视觉、文本和音频模态的分解机制；2）采用对比学习融合多模态并动态交互语义信息的融合策略；3）结合语义和几何线索的双路径重建机制。

Result: 在视觉、文本和音频多个模态的实验中，DFR框架在多种场景下明显优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DFR框架显著改善了多模态指导下的少样本分割性能，表明其在多模态集成和语义理解上的技术突破。

Abstract: This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有点云补全网络难以应对真实世界中的噪声和遮挡问题，因此需要新方法提升现实场景中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DWCNet在处理复杂点云降级问题上表现优越，同时提供了新的数据集和公开代码以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and
code will be publicly available at

Motivation: 针对跨域小样本分割领域，由于数据和领域偏移的限制，目前方法表现不足，而基础模型如SAM虽具有零样本泛化能力，但在跨域场景中的适配仍具有较大挑战。

Method: 提出了包括三个关键模块的CMP框架：(i)参考补充与变换模块(RCT)扩展语义，(ii)可组合元提示生成模块(CMPG)自动生成元提示，(iii)频率感知交互模块(FAI)缓解领域差异。

Result: 在四个跨域数据集上进行评估，CMP框架在1-shot和5-shot场景中分别达到了71.8%和74.5%的mIoU，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CMP框架有效克服了手动提示和跨域适应性的挑战，在CD-FSS问题中实现了显著的性能提升，展示了其前瞻性与应用潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to
limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction
(FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four
cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving
71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始B-cos模型虽然具有竞争力的诊断性能和解释性，但存在解释图中伪影问题且不适用于多标签设置，限制其在医学影像领域的应用。

Method: 引入FLCPooling(FLC)和BlurPool(BP)抗锯齿策略提升解释图质量；扩展B-cos网络，支持多标签分类任务。

Result: 改进后的B-cos模型在胸部X光数据集上表现出色，既维持了高预测性能，又提供了清晰、无伪影的解释图，适合临床多标签环境。

Conclusion: 改进的B-cos网络解决了原始网络中的伪影问题，并扩展了多标签适用性，为医学影像分析提供了可靠的解释工具，促进了深度学习模型在安全关键领域的应用。

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的零样本量化框架，针对目标检测任务通过生成任务特定校准数据和整合训练方法，成功提高了量化网络的性能。

Abstract: Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 通过结合不同生成器的合成数据集，能有效缓解模型过拟合问题，提高面部识别系统的性能，同时减少对真实数据依赖，缓解隐私和伦理担忧。

Abstract: While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有图像引导合成方法在处理人类与物体交互时易出破绽，缺乏自然的无缝交互效果。

Method: 引入两个关键设计：(1)基于MLLMs的区域姿态指引系统（MRPG），识别交互区域和类型并提供生成姿态的约束；(2)细节一致外观保留机制（DCAP），确保前景和背景人物纹理形状一致且背景还原真实。此外提出首个任务相关的数据集IHOC。

Conclusion: HOComp方法通过创新设计和数据支持，有效解决了人类与物体自然交互合成的难题，是目前领先的方法。

Abstract: While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏多步规划能力和适应复杂任务变化的能力，因此提出需要一种能够进行高阶推理并有效执行动作的框架。

Method: 采用双系统框架，基于多模态大型语言模型生成推理计划，并结合强化学习通过视觉奖励学习目标完成和轨迹一致性，该计划被压缩成视觉潜在变量用于后续动作模型的执行。

Result: 在实体推理和机器人操作基准测试上表现出少样本适应能力、长时规划和自我纠错能力。

Conclusion: ThinkAct能够提升复杂环境中视觉-语言-动作推理任务的表现，有效结合推理和动作执行。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction

### [82] [eSapiens's DEREK Module: Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15863)
*Isaac Shi,Zeyuan Li,Fan Liu,Wenli Wang,Lewei He,Yang Yang,Tianyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEREK模块是一种面向企业文档问答的安全可扩展生成管道，集成了多种技术提高问答精准性和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决企业文档问答中信息检索的准确性、安全性，以及答案的可追溯性等问题，满足企业需求。

Method: 通过结合HNSW+BM25索引进行检索，使用多组件如GPT-4o、Cohere重新排序及LangGraph验证器确保答案基于事实，利用安全容器化部署强化安全性。

Result: 在法律领域数据集上显著提高检索召回率和答案精准性，同时有效限制不受支持陈述比例至低于3%。

Conclusion: DEREK模块为高风险领域如法律和金融提供了一种安全、准确、可追溯的文档问答解决方案，兼具高效性与企业级要求。

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge)
Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed
specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and
implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,
web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a
hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via
combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using
CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,
regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,
1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank
boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe
Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All
components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These
results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and
production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is
designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful
retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal
and finance.

### [83] [Adversarial Demonstration Learning for Low-resource NER Using Dual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15864)
*Guowen Yuan,Tien-Hsuan Wu,Lianghao Xia,Ben Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究低资源场景下基于示例学习的命名实体识别(NER)问题，提出了一种新的示例选择策略和训练方法，有效提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有示例选择方法以及NER模型训练中存在的问题，以提高低资源场景下的NER性能。

Method: 提出基于双重相似性的示例选择方法，考虑语义相似性和特征相似性；并设计对抗性训练机制，促使模型在标注任务中引用示例。

Result: 在低资源NER任务中，通过大量实验验证了该方法的优越性，相比其他方法表现更佳。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效改善低资源场景下NER模型的性能，为示例学习方法的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration
learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration
construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting
demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that
feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly,
we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is
generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that
effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select
examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and
feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with
adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the
demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive
experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our
method outperforms a range of methods.

### [84] [Small Edits, Big Consequences: Telling Good from Bad Robustness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15868)
*Altynbek Ismailov,Salia Asanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析大语言模型（LLMs）对提示中的微小扰动（如删减、词汇替换等）的敏感性和鲁棒性，发现模型对信息不足过于鲁棒，但对关键任务翻转的细微变化较为迟钝，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在代码生成任务中，面对提示中的细微扰动时能否做出合适的反应，以免因过度鲁棒性或不敏锐的表现导致错误或高成本。

Method: 针对50个LeetCode问题设计三种最小扰动类型（递进式信息不足、关键定量词替换、高级术语替换），用六种主流模型进行实验，分析其生成的Python代码是否正确完成任务及是否灵活适应变动。

Result: 模型在信息不足情况（丢失90%提示）下仍能保持85%的正确率，但对关键定量词的改变仅有54%的灵敏度，说明模型对不同类型扰动的反应差异较大，其中专注推理调整的模型反而表现更迟钝。

Conclusion: 当前的LLMs对提示中的细节变化区分度较低，把无害噪声与语义重要变更混为一谈，显现需要通过奖励灵敏性以在噪音与语义切实变更两者中作出准确区分的改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a
single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to
overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful
insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal
prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive
underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping
a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a
common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including
three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python
outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they
reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a
sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 %
of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet
only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with
reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie
in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between
harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.
Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We
advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential
sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when
semantics truly change.

### [85] [Enhancing Hindi NER in Low Context: A Comparative study of Transformer-based models with vs. without Retrieval Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16002)
*Sumit Singh,Rohit Mishra,Uma Shanker Tiwary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用预训练编码器和生成模型（如MuRIL、XLM-R和Llama系列）结合检索增强（RA）提升印地语NER性能的效果，结果显示，RA显著提升了多数模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中命名实体识别（NER）面临挑战，目标是通过数据增强和模型优化提升印地语NER性能，尤其针对低资源语言。

Method: 研究结合Hindi特定预训练编码器（如MuRIL、XLM-R）、生成模型（如Llama和GPT-3.5 Turbo）以及从外部（例如Wikipedia）检索的上下文数据，用于RA增强，模型包括微调与少样本学习。

Result: 加入RA后，大多数模型性能提高，MuRIL的宏F1分数从0.69提升到0.70，XLM-R从0.495提升到0.71。GPT3.5-turbo表现良好，而部分模型（如Llama2-70B等）对RA适应较差。

Conclusion: 研究表明，RA对低上下文数据显著改善NER性能，为低资源语言的NER数据增强和模型选择提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity
recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual
input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique
that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and
Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf
(Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments
the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from
Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA.
However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER
generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)
with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't
incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69
and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,
respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B
by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not
fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA
well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval
context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,
especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about
how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER
performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

*Benoit Dherin,Michael Munn,Hanna Mazzawi,Michael Wunder,Javier Gonzalvo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）能够在推理时通过上下文学习新模式的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对上下文学习的新模式进行研究，以揭示LLM的潜在机制，特别是模型如何在未更新权重的情况下实现这一点。

Method: 提出通过理论和实验分析，展示自注意力层与MLP结合的Transformer模块可以对MLP权重进行隐式更新。

Result: 发现Transformer模块通过上下文生成低秩的MLP权重更新，从而使模型能够实现上下文学习。

Conclusion: 通过简单的假设和机制，理论证明和实验支持了LLM上下文学习能力的来源，进而增强了对其内部运作的理解。

Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their
ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn
new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are
presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were
not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are
still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a
self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly
modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through
theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why
LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show
under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly
transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

*Hannah Rashkin,Elizabeth Clark,Fantine Huot,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究讨论了大型语言模型（LLMs）在向创意写作者提供反馈时的能力和局限性，并提出了任务定义、数据集以及评估框架。通过受控试验集和评价方法，检验了LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在为创意写作提供有意义反馈方面面临的挑战和局限性，旨在为其改进奠定基础。

Method: 提出了一个包含1,300个故意引入写作问题的故事的新测试集，并结合自动化和人工评估方法对LLMs提供的反馈效果进行了全面分析。

Result: 尽管LLMs在许多方面具有强大的初始表现，能够提供具体且大多数准确的写作反馈，但它们在识别故事中最大问题和判断提供批评性或正面反馈的时机上表现不足。

Conclusion: LLMs目前在创意写作反馈的准确性和判断方面仍存在显著不足，对其改进仍有较大空间。

Abstract: Can LLMs provide support to creative writers by giving meaningful writing
feedback? In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of
model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and
evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we
present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally
introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in
this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows
that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects --
providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often
fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide
when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 作者提出了 mRAKL 系统，将多语言知识图谱构建（mKGC）任务转化为问答任务，使用 RAG 方法提升低资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在处理多语言知识图谱构建时，尤其是针对低资源语言的任务，仍存在很多挑战。作者希望探索一种新的方法，以提高构建准确性。

Method: 将 mKGC 任务重新定义为问答任务，借助头实体和链接关系生成问题，并通过模型预测尾实体作为答案。引入检索增强生成（RAG）框架，并结合 BM25 检索系统进行实验。

Result: 在蒂格里尼亚语和阿姆哈拉语的低资源场景中，使用 RAG 框架的整体性能优于无上下文方法。在理想检索系统下，mRAKL 分别在两种语言中提高了 4.92 和 8.79 个百分点的准确率。

Conclusion: mRAKL 系统展示了通过问答方式和基于 RAG 框架提升多语言知识图谱构建性能的潜力，尤其在低资源语言场景下效果显著。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs represent real-world entities and the relationships between
them. Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of
automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for
knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the
mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve
this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having
our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily
on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using
higher-resourced languages Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer. With
a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over
a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized
retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points
for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

*Simon Baeuerle,Max Radyschevski,Ulrike Pado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨在工程部门利用生成式人工智能(genAI)进行会议记录自动化的应用，解决会议时间高、信息难以检索的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频繁的面对面会议存在文档记录不一致的问题，且信息检索困难。生成式人工智能（如大型语言模型）的语言处理能力为会议知识管理提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 研究通过开发一个端到端的管道，在概念验证的状态下实现自动化会议记录生成，并以聊天机器人接口实现信息的可搜索性。在真实的工程部门对该系统进行了测试，收集了有关伦理和技术层面的用户反馈。

Result: 用户反馈显示，使用生成式人工智能可以显著减少会议工作量，技术问题基本得到解决，但成功实施还需解决组织和伦理问题。

Conclusion: 生成式人工智能在会议记录和信息管理中的应用潜力巨大，但全面推广需针对组织伦理考虑进行优化。

Abstract: In large organisations, knowledge is mainly shared in meetings, which takes
up significant amounts of work time. Additionally, frequent in-person meetings
produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes,
presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard
to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and
high-frequency meeting schedules.
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language
processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management
in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and
integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable
format for ad-hoc searches.
  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting
documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and
minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through
a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software
tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey
data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this
real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that
the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI
models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational
aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理在生成复杂长篇报告时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的方法来优化这个过程。

Method: 提出了一种名为TTD-DR的方法，将研究报告生成视为扩散过程，初稿作为指导方向的基础，通过迭代改进与外部信息反馈不断优化，同时应用自我进化算法提升各组件性能。

Result: 实验表明，TTD-DR在需要高强度搜索和多跳推理的基准测试上达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有的研究代理方法。

Conclusion: TTD-DR成功解决了复杂报告生成中的信息丢失和效率问题，为深度研究代理带来了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly
advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,
long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing
inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles
of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep
Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report
generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a
preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation
to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through
a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism
that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is
further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of
the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the
diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process
more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative
search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and
multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过不同角色采用和人口学提示策略的提示方式对大语言模型（LLMs）模拟效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过构造不同的角色和人口学提示方式提高LLMs对不同的社会群体模拟的真实度，特别是在对边缘群体的表现上。

Method: 使用五个开源LLM模型，分析15个交叉社会人口群体，通过开放性和封闭性任务探讨角色采用模式及人口学提示的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs难以真实模拟边缘群体，尤其是非二元性别、西班牙裔和中东群体。不过，采用访谈式提示和基于名称的提示能减少刻板印象并提高模拟效果。而且，小模型在某些情况下表现优于大型模型。

Conclusion: 针对社会人口学群体提示的优化可改善LLM的模拟能力，为未来的研究设计与应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to
simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona
prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about
the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we
systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically
role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM
simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and
closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate
marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern
identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption
strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that
prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce
stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B
outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable
guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation
studies.

Motivation: 提升LLMs在现实中多任务处理能力，并适应资源受限场景下的应用需求。

Method: 提出一种名为Learnable Calibration的方法，用于高效地在设备端完成多任务，同时设计了四个实际相关的基准测试拓展研究。

Result: 为多任务并行的场景提供了高效的解决方案，使LLMs在有限资源场景下表现出色，并提升了其实际应用能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究奠定了推进LLMs在复杂多任务情况下的应用基础，强调资源效率与性能并重的重要性。

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine
learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large
language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to
support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work
on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been
limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In
this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based
compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous
execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a
long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks
concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark
comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an
efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,
where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions
that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the
groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking
scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管标准孟加拉语的仇恨言论检测已有进展，但现有数据集和系统无法覆盖方言中丰富的非正式和文化表达，导致检测能力有限和内容审核不平等。

Method: 通过将BD-SHS语料库中的9183个实例翻译并注释为包括Barishal、Noakhali和Chittagong三种主要方言的形式，构建了BIDWESH数据集，并手动校验确保语言和上下文的准确性。

Result: 生成了一个语言丰富、平衡且包容的多方言孟加拉语仇恨言论检测数据集，为开发方言敏感的自然语言处理工具提供了基础。

Conclusion: BIDWESH显著推动了低资源语言环境下的公平和上下文感知内容审核，为孟加拉语仇恨言论检测领域提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Hate speech on digital platforms has become a growing concern globally,
especially in linguistically diverse countries like Bangladesh, where regional
dialects play a major role in everyday communication. Despite progress in hate
speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to
address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as
Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection
capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content
unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first
multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and
annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional
dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type
(slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual,
male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The
resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive
resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the
groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes
significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource
language settings.

TL;DR: 此研究通过MindGames测试显示大语言模型在规划中的理论心智能力(LToM)不足，与人的表现之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在动态规划和影响他人心智状态时的理论心智能力。

Method: 通过设计任务(MindGames)，要求测试主体推断对话者的信念与愿望，并尝试说服对方改变行为来评估模型与人的表现差异。

Result: 实验发现，人类在任务中的表现比大语言模型o1-preview高出11％(p=0.006)，但在无需复杂心智推断的基线上，o1-preview表现优于人类。

Conclusion: 研究表明人类在高度社交推理任务中表现显著优于大语言模型，凸显出人类与LLM在社交推理能力上的重要差距。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind
(ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial
role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human
ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically
intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning
theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's
beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous
evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans
significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;
$p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model
of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's
preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline
condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state
inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already
given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between
human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估过于集中于答案的“诚实性”而忽略了为何产生“不知道”。需要明确区分模型的能力局限和输入的内在不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种框架，量化出“不知道”答案中由模型能力不足引起的比例，并通过引导性刺激测试模型是否能得出正确答案或确实无解的结论。

Result: 验证了在不同LLMs上，框架可以帮助发现模型推理的真实范围和改进潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为分析LLMs推理能力极限提供了更清晰的方法，并为解决模糊感知问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, yet
current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are
\emph{honest} rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an
input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the
model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon \emph{Vague Perception}. And
thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of \emph{Unknown}
responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation
can convert them into either correct (\emph{Known}) or intrinsically
indeterminate outcomes. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method
provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for
improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different
LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the
accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the
true reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在长上下文大型语言模型中进行多样的示例选择策略，以改善许多示例内学习(许多示例内推理)的性能和降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多示例内学习常以随机选择示例的方法进行推理，这虽便捷且性能接近其他策略，但存在推理效率和性能可以进一步优化的空间。

Method: 提出了两种改进的许多示例选择策略：1) 结合基于测试样本相似性选择的少量示例与大量缓存的随机示例；2) 将随机示例替换为通过k-means聚类从测试样本表示中获悉的质心相关的示例。

Result: 实验表明，与随机选择相比，这些策略不仅在多个数据集上表现出更好的性能，并且还支持缓存功能，同时推理成本降低达到一个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的方法既在性能上超过现有方法，又显著减少成本，为许多示例内学习提供了新的平衡解。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs
containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning
(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the
input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of
demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)
high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and
(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when
scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for
demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal
computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of
demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a
disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The
second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with
those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via
k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several
datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection
and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting
caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on
different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in
professional research applications, such as STEM, software development,
finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as
it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity.
However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically
and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents.
Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety.
To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based
Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It
provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across
7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of
this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system
that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the
intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust
evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research
questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the

TL;DR: 本文提出通过低维潜在状态表示和长期策略优化提升基于LLM的数学辅导性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM使用RLHF框架基于短期人类偏好优化，对多轮对话（如在线数学辅导）表现有限。

Method: 引入低维潜在状态表示学生的对话历史，并基于此优化长期策略决定高层次行动。

Result: 在LLM模拟的辅导任务中，该方法提升了长期结果表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在资源需求较低的情况下使得基于LLM的数学辅导更加高效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on
immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in
multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method
to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a
lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a
long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The
goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of
guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our
model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of
training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next
utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to
improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring
tasks.

datasets and establishes a benchmark by evaluating both forgetting
effectiveness and the preservation of standard capabilities. In this work, we
propose a more controllable forgetting loss, Effective Unlearning Loss, and

<details>

Motivation: 现有的LLMs在从复杂文件中提取信息时输出混乱、无组织且不可追溯，因此需要一个专门的基准来评估其信息整合能力。

Method: 设计了AOE基准，包括11项任务，覆盖三个不同领域，要求LLMs根据上下文生成特定的表格结构并整理信息。实验比较了开源和闭源的LLMs表现。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的LLMs在AOE任务中仍存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs距离能够系统性地、准确地从复杂文档中提取和重构信息的目标还有很大差距。

Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation
that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world
documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style
answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new
bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to
systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents
and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike
conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task
domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains,
requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input
queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source
state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models
struggled significantly. The benchmark is available at

Result: 短于150字符的文本中，该算法的准确率超过80%；对于较长文本及较早期的写作，该算法达到100%准确率。

Conclusion: 基于字频的传统算法在语言识别中仍具有效性和可扩展性，是AI驱动模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: The debate surrounding language identification has gained renewed attention
in recent years, especially with the rapid evolution of AI-powered language
models. However, the non-AI-based approaches to language identification have
been overshadowed. This research explores a mathematical implementation of an
algorithm for language determinism by leveraging monograms and bigrams
frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The datasets
used comprise texts varying in length, historical period, and genre, including
short stories, fairy tales, and poems. Despite these variations, the method
achieves over 80\% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches
100\% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. These results demonstrate
that classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable
alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语言模型（LLM）在扩展词汇表时面临输出投影层规模线性增长的限制，阻碍了词汇表的显著扩展。

Method: 提出了SpeLLM方法，利用多输出头逐字符预测方式，将输入和输出词汇表解耦，每个线性头独立预测一个字符。同时，运用自蒸馏技术将标准LLM模型转换为SpeLLM。

Result: 实验表明，四种预训练LLM被转换为SpeLLM后，其变体在下游任务中具有竞争力表现，同时平均缩短运行时间5.1%。

Conclusion: SpeLLM方法为降低LLM成本提供了一种潜在途径，同时优化了对弱代表语言和领域的支持。

Abstract: Scaling LLM vocabulary is often used to reduce input sequence length and
alleviate attention's quadratic cost. Yet, current LLM architectures impose a
critical bottleneck to this procedure: the output projection layer scales
linearly with vocabulary size, rendering substantial expansion impractical. We
propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by
predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM,
each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously,
enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller,
independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for
converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained
LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream
tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach
provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support
for underrepresented languages and domains.

Conclusion: 形式化语言推理结合自动化验证和RL优化，使得LLMs在可靠软件验证中展示了潜力，降低了对人类先验知识的依赖。

Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models
(LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge:
their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are
neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models
could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted
alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous
formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,
Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their
reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving
large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to
employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the
reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes
unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex
programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human
priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot
study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data
curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the
formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional
formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification
reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models
(e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code,
surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves
performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and
outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

Abstract: Within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), fairness evaluation
is often associated with the assessment of bias and reduction of associated
harm. In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a
benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the
measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions,
including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large
Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by
Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender
identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German.
The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and
corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of
the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation
because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language
such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two
subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity,
and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate
several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the
accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both
along and against existing social stereotypes.

Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在少样本场景下未充分考虑未标记样本的作用，导致经验分布与目标分布不一致，优化决策边界和样本选择的效果有限。

Method: 基于未标记数据构建样本感知的动态软提示，调整模型的预测分布和决策边界，并结合全局和局部多样性选择高质量样本，以优化经验分布与目标分布的对齐。

Result: 在六个域内和三个域外数据集上，PromptAL比九种基线方法表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过主动学习框架PromptAL结合未标记数据分布调整和高质量样本选择，可以有效提升少样本场景下的模型表现。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL
methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the
decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently
identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the
empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target
distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal
position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in
enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target
distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of
samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,
we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware
Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning).
This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in
aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,
thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first
leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that
adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,
based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation
with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more
accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six
in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior
performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

Method: 引入荷兰语版CrowS-Pairs数据集，用以测试多种语言模型（包括BERTje、RobBERT等）的偏见；并对比分析英语、法语语言模型的偏见表现。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型在多个类别上存在显著偏见，英语模型的偏见最为严重，而荷兰语模型偏见最少。此外，语言模型的偏见水平随着赋予不同角色而有变化。

Conclusion: 偏见因语言和文化背景的不同而有差异，应考虑多语言和文化因素来降低语言模型的偏见。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes
which might be upsetting.
  Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and
harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of
these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of
recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language
models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A
Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in
Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463
sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation,
Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting
sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the
other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that
various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and
Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using
the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated
in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language
models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas
Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that
assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.
These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,
suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in
shaping model biases.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents hold promise for a flexible and scalable
alternative to traditional business process automation, but struggle to
reliably follow complex company policies. In this study we introduce a

offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard
code associated with tool use, and (2) a runtime integration where these guards
ensure compliance before each agent action. We demonstrate our approach on the
challenging $\tau$-bench Airlines domain, showing encouraging preliminary
results in policy enforcement, and further outline key challenges for
real-world deployments.

Conclusion: ICR探针不仅有效解决了幻觉检测问题，还提供了更深入的机制理解，对后续研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

Motivation: 目标是探究通过结合PLM和主题模型提取特征来改善等级文本分类(HTC)的性能，并验证其有效性。

Method: 使用PLM与主题模型分别提取文本特征，通过单独的卷积层处理后，再结合注意力机制生成针对类别的文本表示用于分类。

Result: 实验基于三个HTC基准数据集，结果表明，与使用仅由PLM提取的特征相比，加入主题模型特征通常会降低分类性能。

Conclusion: 与先前研究相反，加入主题模型特征并不一定对文本分类任务有益，这颠覆了一种普遍假设。

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task
which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes
from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various
techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the
natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models
along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an
effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale
behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM
captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic
model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents
as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic
model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a
classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of
the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in
general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate
convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise
attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by
weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform
comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using
the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification
performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In
contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features
extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed
beneficial.

that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to
large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving
Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess
scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two
components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed
science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+
subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**,
and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled
and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.
Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE
effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific
fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and
forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic
measure of how well foundation models handle science questions. The project

### [111] [Introducing Quality Estimation to Machine Translation Post-editing Workflow: An Empirical Study on Its Usefulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16515)
*Siqi Liu,Guangrong Dai,Dechao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了句子级别质量估算（QE）在英中机器翻译后编辑（MTPE）中的作用，发现QE能显著缩短编辑时间，但不准确的QE可能会阻碍效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索句子级质量估算（QE）在提高英语至中文机器翻译后编辑效率中的可用性，以及其对学生翻译员的影响。

Method: 分析QE对后编辑效率的作用，并研究其与机器翻译质量和翻译专业水平的交互影响，结合实验结果及采访数据进行评价。

Result: QE显著减少了后编辑时间，对中高质量机器翻译输出和不同水平学生翻译员的影响一致，但不准确的QE可能对编辑过程造成阻碍。

Conclusion: 研究表明，QE可以在标记潜在问题段落的同时，验证译文质量并帮助翻译员审核结果。然而，需解决不准确性问题，以更有效地整合进工作流程来提升生产力。

Abstract: This preliminary study investigates the usefulness of sentence-level Quality
Estimation (QE) in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE),
focusing on its impact on post-editing speed and student translators'
perceptions. It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT
quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal
that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction
effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE
efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student
translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating
potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as
validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to
double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that
inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new
insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more
effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.

Motivation: 旨在解决文本风格调整和作者身份分析等关键挑战。

Method: 通过大语言模型的高效参数调整、风格特征的对比解耦及基于指令的微调实现。

Result: 提供了更高效的方法来调整文本风格和分析作者身份。

Conclusion: 研究推进了文本风格操控及作者身份分析领域，为未来工作提供了基础。

Abstract: This thesis advances the computational understanding and manipulation of text
styles through three interconnected pillars: (1) Text Style Transfer (TST),
which alters stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment, formality) while preserving
content; (2)Authorship Attribution (AA), identifying the author of a text via
stylistic fingerprints; and (3) Authorship Verification (AV), determining
whether two texts share the same authorship. We address critical challenges in
these areas by leveraging parameter-efficient adaptation of large language
models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and
instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification.

Abstract: In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias
in large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of
bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when
applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research
strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs.
The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are
accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight
multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias
in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms
and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work
contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and
underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.

Motivation: 探究多模态大语言模型在直观物理任务中的表现和局限性，识别问题根源并为未来改进提供方向。

Method: 通过GRASP和IntPhys 2数据集测试InternVL 2.5、Qwen 2.5 VL、LLaVA-OneVision和Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking等模型，同时对模型嵌入进行探测性分析，研究任务相关信息的保留情况。

Result: 结果显示在任务较复杂时，模型存在视觉语言失配问题：视觉编码器能捕捉物理可行性线索，但语言模型未能有效利用，导致推理失败。

Conclusion: 论文认为MLLMs在直观物理任务中主要局限在视-语言信息集成效率不足，提出改进视-语言对齐是未来发展的关键。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and
IntPhys 2 datasets. We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that
even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible
from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a
probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations
at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is
preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical
vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture
physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by
the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment
suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not
the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic
information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for
improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.

Abstract: This paper presents Step-Audio~2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language
model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech
conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric
reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate
genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the
generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly
enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking
styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic
knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to
mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions
of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and
expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results
demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人工智能解决方案在审计财务文档中推荐适当文本段落，但无法验证推荐段落是否符合法规要求，需要评估公共和专有LLMs在这一场景中的效能。

Method: 通过两组定制数据集，分析开放源码模型Llama-2及专有模型GPT系列在不同场景中的性能表现，数据集由PricewaterhouseCoopers（PwC）德国分部提供。

Result: 发现Llama-2 70B在检测不合规情况（真负样本）方面表现优秀，而GPT-4则在更广泛且尤其是非英语场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: Llama-2在特定合规检测任务中展示出潜力，但在更广泛和多语言情境中，专有模型依然占优。

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,
stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made
inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages
from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting
standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall
short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific
legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly
available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance
across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on
comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their
proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis
leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model
demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true
negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless,
proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of
scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在处理语言学任务中的潜在能力，探索如何通过教育理论优化模型的表现。

Method: 使用PhonologyBench基准测试评估12个LLMs的任务表现，并引入基于教育理论的参与式链式思维（P-CoT）提示方法。

Result: P-CoT方法不仅激活了模型潜在的语音学能力，还使模型的性能提高了高达52%，在某些任务中甚至超越了人类表现。

Conclusion: P-CoT方法有效优化了LLMs在语言学任务中的表现，未来可探索其在不同语言领域的应用及针对模型的进一步优化。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of phonological reasoning within text-based
large language models (LLMs). Utilizing the PhonologyBench benchmark, we assess
tasks like rhyme word generation, g2p conversion, and syllable counting. Our
evaluations across 12 LLMs reveal that while few-shot learning offers
inconsistent gains, the introduction of a novel Pedagogically-motivated
Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt, which is anchored in educational
theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, consistently enhances
performance. This method leverages structured guidance to activate latent
phonological abilities, achieving up to 52% improvement and even surpassing
human baselines in certain tasks. Future work could aim to optimize P-CoT
prompts for specific models or explore their application across different
linguistic domains.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨多模态生成和理解模型中存在的自相矛盾现象，并提出Nonunified得分量化这一现象。引入内部监督的后训练方法，解决生成和理解能力的不对称，尤其通过单独优化生成分支改进了生成与整体任务统一。分析还揭示了基础数据质量对训练动态和监督效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者发现当前多模态生成和理解模型（MLLMs）中存在显著的能力不对称，特别是生成能力对提示的对齐不足，而模型理解部分表现较强。为了进一步提升这些模型的性能和统一性，有必要分析和解决生成-理解不匹配问题并探索潜在优化方向。

Method: 1. 提出Nonunified评分，用于量化模型的生成-理解自相矛盾程度；2. 将生成模型和理解模块间的不匹配纳入内部监督信号，通过后训练方法（如SFT、DPO）优化生成分支，并通过课程学习法逐步增强难例处理能力；3. 理论和实验证明生成能力的提高对理解模块识别错误对齐的帮助。

Result: 通过使用内部监督信号进行后训练，显著改进了生成和理解能力，并发现单独优化生成分支能产生协同改进效应。而且，作者发现数据质量对训练有显著影响，例如不良监督可能导致生成和理解的共同退化。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了解决MLLM生成和理解不匹配的新方向，强调改进生成能力对整体性能和统一性的重要性，同时证明课程学习法可提升模型的学习效果。进一步指出内在评价指标的局限性，并建议加强数据质量监控以防止退化。

Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a
single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation
produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own
understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such
self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction
mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather
than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of
leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model
understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the
generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,
SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation
and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and
understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known
in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows
improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously
incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned
training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced
prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the
understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of
co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is
empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics
like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,
which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a
curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces
harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and
improved MLLM generation and understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PICACO方法，通过优化元指令解决大语言模型在对齐多样人类价值观时的Instruction Bottleneck问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型尽管在与人类价值对齐方面展示出潜力，但由于输入提示识别能力有限，当面对多种价值冲突时难以平衡，从而导致不完整或偏向的对齐。

Method: 提出了一种无须微调的新方法——PICACO，通过最大化指定价值观和模型响应间的总体相关性，优化元指令导航多重价值输入，减少噪声干扰，从而更好地理解和对齐多种人类价值观。

Result: 在五组价值数据集上的实验表明，PICACO在多达8种不同价值下达到了更高的平衡性，并且在黑盒和开源大语言模型上均优于当前强基线方法。

Conclusion: PICACO能有效解决Instruction Bottleneck问题，提供了一种增强大语言模型多样价值观对齐的新思路。

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate
diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment
(ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting
ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently
pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.
tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck
challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a
single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we
propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO
optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit
LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by
maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,
theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,
resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value
sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,
outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance
across up to 8 distinct values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的检索增强智能系统缺乏与其目标对齐的评估框架，而现有评测存在查询脱离实际、标注噪声干扰、缺乏对迭代过程分析等问题。

Method: 设计RAVine评估框架，包括多点查询评估、归因式的精细评测策略，用以更贴近用户意图，并评测系统在检索互动中的过程效率。

Result: 通过RAVine对模型进行基准测试，获得了若干关于如何改进和发展Agentic搜索系统的重要见解。

Conclusion: RAVine的提出帮助提升了Agentic搜索系统评估的现实性和细致度，对推动该领域发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval
augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However,
existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic
search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often
deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to
introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,
leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current
frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the
evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address
these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework
for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form
answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground
truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.
Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the
iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a
series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will
contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

TL;DR: 研究了多义话语标记与语域对信号互动的影响，发现多义标记与更多样化的非标记信号共现，而语域显著影响信号的互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多义话语标记（DM）与非话语标记（non-DM）共现信号之间的关系，并研究语域如何影响这些模式。

Method: 基于eRST框架，提出DM多义性的分级定义，通过相关性和回归分析，研究多义DM是否与更丰富、多样化的非DM信号共现。

Result: 多义DM确实与更具多样性的非DM信号共现，但总共现信号数量不一定增加。此外，语域对DM与信号的互动模式有显著影响。

Conclusion: 多义性增加了DM与更多样信号的联系，同时强调了语域在塑造这些互动中的关键作用。

Abstract: Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating
coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs
('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous
('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such
signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM
signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.
  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy,
and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous
DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings
reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the
total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover,
genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决大语言模型推理中的上下文限制问题，提高推理的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出了Thread Inference Model (TIM)及其运行时系统TIMRUN，采用自然语言推理树代替线性序列，并通过规则筛选机制降低上下文冗余。

Result: 在数学推理和长程推理任务中实现高效的推理性能，即使操作90%的KV缓存时仍然具有高推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该系统突破了上下文限制，提供了长程推理能力和工具调用的可行性，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck
reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),
a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and
TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond
context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited
working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model
inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and
GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as
reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.
The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and
conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During
generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states
of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning
mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages
throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high
inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU
memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles
information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and

### [125] [Test-Time-Matching: Decouple Personality, Memory, and Linguistic Style in LLM-based Role-Playing Language Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16799)
*Xiaoyu Zhan,Xinyu Fu,Hao Sun,Yuanqi Li,Jie Guo,Yanwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Test-Time-Matching（TTM）的无训练角色扮演框架，用于提升语言模型在角色扮演任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在角色扮演中面临着依赖提示不足以及微调方法对计算资源要求高的限制。

Method: 提出了一种名为Test-Time-Matching（TTM）的方法，利用测试时缩放和上下文工程，结合三阶段生成流程，解析角色的性格、记忆和语言风格。

Result: 通过人工评估，TTM框架被证明在生成具有表现力和一致性角色对话上表现出色。

Conclusion: TTM框架可以在无需训练的情况下实现高保真的角色扮演效果，并支持多样化的角色组合及风格变换。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled
role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various
applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often
proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,
particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,
fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated
with data collection and the computational resources required for training,
thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we
propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework
through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to
automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and
linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation
pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves
high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations
across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.
We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate
that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive
and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate tremendous potential in the
financial domain, yet existing models often fall short in scenarios demanding
robust reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness requirements, and
efficient adaptation to task-specific needs. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1
series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically
engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning
capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial
applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic
financial task taxonomy with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness
assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy
knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous
data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware
optimization, tow-stage learning processes, and detailed attribution systems,
we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo
comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including FinEva,
FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500
and GPQA. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we
innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on
agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental
results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning
capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for
high-stakes financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于注重最终答案准确性，缺乏对推理过程的评估，且语言覆盖范围有限，无法有效衡量LLMs在复杂语言学任务中的能力。

Method: LingBench++ 提供结构化推理轨迹、逐步评估协议以及涵盖90多种低资源和跨文化语言的丰富类属元数据。同时，开发了多代理架构，结合了语法知识检索、工具增强推理和假设测试。

Result: 实验显示，利用外部知识源和迭代推理的模型在准确性和可解释性能上均优于单次推理方法。

Conclusion: LingBench++ 为推动LLMs在语言学基础、文化背景与认知可行性方面的推理提供了全面基础。

Abstract: We propose LingBench++, a linguistically-informed benchmark and reasoning
framework designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex
linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL).
Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++
provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich
typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages.
We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge
retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through
systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we
demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative
reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and
interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing
linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible
reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章提出了科学推理对AI科学家和人类科学研究的重要性，并提供了两个主要数据集TextbookReasoning和MegaScience，以填补高质量科学推理数据集的空缺，并通过实验和模型训练验证其实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前开源社区更关注数学与代码，对科学领域推理的研究较少，主要因缺乏高质量、可验证的科学推理数据集。该论文旨在弥补这个空白。

Method: 文章提出TextbookReasoning数据集，从12k大学科学教材中提取真答案；MegaScience数据集，通过系统消融研究选择最佳子集；建立全面评估系统，涵盖15个基准，结合综合答案提取策略确保评估准确性；并训练和评估多个模型表现。

Result: 实验表明，MegaScience相比已有数据集表现更优，同时其训练效率和回答长度更简练；训练的大模型在平均表现上明显优于官方模型，尤其在更大的模型上体现出扩展优势。

Conclusion: 发布的数据集、评估系统、数据管道及培训模型促进科学推理研究，并验证了MegaScience对更大更强模型的扩展效益。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting
human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery.
However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and
coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of
open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To
bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring
truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific
textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific
disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of
high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed
through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection
methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available
scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system
covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,
incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate
evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve
superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths
compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train
Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which
significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average
performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger
and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We
release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven
trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

*Shai Shalev-Shwartz,Amnon Shashua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的学习范式“Diligent Learner”，通过深度优先搜索和回溯策略，提升了解决复杂推理任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如监督微调、强化学习等在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，亟需一种能够解决分布漂移、缺乏嵌入搜索和推理成本高等问题的新方法。

Method: 提出Diligent Learner框架，采用由验证器指导的深度优先搜索策略，并支持在失败时进行回溯，提高问题解决能力。

Result: 在两个温和且现实的假设下，证明该方法可以从链式推理数据中高效学习，而现有方法则无法实现。

Conclusion: Diligent Learner为基于非完整数据构建可扩展且可靠的推理系统提供了新路径，推动了具备强健、可解释推理能力的大型推理模型的发展。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing
the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and
existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --
often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles
that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of
embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent
Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a
depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon
failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent
Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do
so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable
reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the
way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust,
interpretable problem-solving abilities.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于整数线性规划的优化方法，用于解决肉类加工企业材料采购和加工中的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源危机导致欧洲食品生产行业面临挑战，因此提高输入材料的高效使用显得尤为重要。

Method: 通过将问题形式化为包含多种约束的整数线性规划问题，并开发了一种简单的迭代算法。

Result: 使用真实数据测试表明，该算法能够在几秒钟内找到所有用例的优化解。

Conclusion: 研究表明，该方法有效解决了问题中涉及的约束，并能快速解决实际问题，具有实用性。

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces
many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the
energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input
materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This
paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent
material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the
majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns
supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The
problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock
of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely
neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the
minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints
makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple
iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve
real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming
solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical
issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a
commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat
processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a
few seconds for all considered use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对ADAS车辆产生的大量驾驶数据，识别安全关键的特殊场景（如刹车情境）成为挑战，现有方法在复杂环境中缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 提出一个基于LLM的场景理解框架，将低级数字信号与自然语言描述相结合，并采用双路径场景检索机制，支持已知和未知场景的识别。

Result: 在Argoverse 2数据集上实验验证显示，该方法在场景检索中优于基于规则的方法，并能很好地泛化到未知场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将LLM用于复杂驾驶场景的理解和分类，提高了场景检索的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前小型语言模型崛起，但加入视觉等额外模态可能因噪声加剧上下文窗口限制问题。

Method: 将原为文本设计的差异注意力机制应用到PaliGemma模型中，并使用LoRA微调模型，探索不同参数配置。

Result: 证明差异注意力机制可适应并提升现有模型的噪声信息检索与问答能力。

Conclusion: 差异注意力机制可用于改进文本-视觉模型的性能，尤其是在处理噪声信息时更为有效。

Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their
efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional
modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context
windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer
attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In
this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed
for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to
evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce
hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,
incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter
settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be
adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy
information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

Motivation: 探讨短期和长期趋势系统在CTA策略中的相对特点与交互影响，厘清争议并优化CTA策略。

Method: 采用贝叶斯图模型动态分解CTA收益，将其归因于短期趋势、长期趋势和市场Beta因子，并量化分析不同时间框架对风险调整后绩效的影响。

Result: 发现CTA策略的风险调整后绩效与短期和长期趋势信号的组合优化密切相关，展现多视角趋势跟踪的重要性。

Conclusion: 有效结合短期和长期趋势信号的CTA策略可以提高风险调整后的收益表现，优化交易管理效率，同时为CTA研究提供了新的视角与方法。

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following
rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that
capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in
fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the
relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain
controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA
returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a
Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the
strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

Motivation: 探讨在开放世界问题中不同模型方法对分布外泛化能力的差异，尤其是ARC-AGI领域。

Method: 进行受控实验，比较神经程序合成和测试时微调方法在ARC-AGI中的表现及能力。

Result: 执行引导的神经程序合成方法优于所有参考算法，测试时微调方法主要激发了大语言模型未直接依赖的分布内知识。

Conclusion: 执行引导的神经程序合成在ARC-AGI中展现了更优的分布外组合能力，可有效处理开放世界问题。

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI
domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize
out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We
compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this
experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms
all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our
empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly
in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on
directly.

Motivation: 复杂系统在扩展时，其语义一致性变得脆弱，因此需要提出能确保一致性的框架来支持规模化的推理和智能。

Method: 研究定义了递归一致性原则（RCP），并引入功能智能模型（FMI），这是一个具有若干内部和外部功能的架构，用于确保系统在扩展时语义结构的一致性。

Result: 证明了没有FMI的系统在扩展中会失去递归一致性，并将AI中的问题如错位、幻觉和不稳定性归因于这种一致性丧失。

Conclusion: 介绍了RCP这一独特的原则，强调内部递归动态对语义一致性及智能对齐的需求，推动AI从行为约束转向结构一致性，提供一种实现安全、通用和稳健AI的新路径。

Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural
coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex
systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures
semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle
(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order
N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic
coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator
that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this
coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system
can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We
formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known
operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,
composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,
adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions
(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving
semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any
system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it
scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and
instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other
foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics
needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under
recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift
from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for
safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于人类中心的AI代理开发指导分散，缺乏一个简明的用户导向词汇框架。

Method: 提出ADEPTS框架，基于六项原则，明确AI代理应具备的基本能力，便利于日常使用中的可理解性、可控性和可信性。

Result: ADEPTS为跨技术和体验开发提供了统一的指导，简化了AI体验需求。

Conclusion: ADEPTS可能加速用户相关能力的改进，并促进以此为基础的AI代理经验设计，同时提供一个共享语言来跟踪开发进度。

Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,
assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This
flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and
cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the
capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current
guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics
focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal
pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no
concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should
fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework
defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance
around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for
human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities
an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and
trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and
taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical
and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex
AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI
researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe
ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent
capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those
capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress
around the development of AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工自主代理技术的快速发展，这些技术逐渐进入实际应用场景。例如自主汽车和人形机器人，如何确保这些系统能够符合伦理行为要求是一个重要问题。

Method: 提出了一种扩展强化学习框架的方法，使人工智能代理能够学习道德推理理论，通过案例反馈进行道德相关的决策，并调整行为以符合道德义务。

Result: 通过初步实验，证明了RBAMAs在道德正当性、道德鲁棒性和道德可信度上的潜力。

Conclusion: RBAMA框架被认为是设计符合关键伦理要求的人工道德代理的一个具体、可部署的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has
demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it
plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As
these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly
approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid
robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes
to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises
concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the
requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research
directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave
ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a
range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents
(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning
architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative
reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn
a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant
propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They
are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these
obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute
to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and
their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a
concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key
ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and
demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments,
especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about
possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or
extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its
applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy,
privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation
frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to
distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user
groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face
higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in
context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored
explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls,
supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored
how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language
Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This
survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for
developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household
automation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了推理时间计算增加对开源模型鲁棒性的影响，并揭示了一个潜在的安全风险：如果中间推理步骤对外暴露，模型的鲁棒性会因推理时间的增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究表明，对大规模专有推理LLM增加推理时间计算可以提升鲁棒性，但研究大多假设中间推理步骤隐藏。本研究希望探讨开放模型是否受益，以及放宽假设情况下潜在的安全问题。

Method: 通过对小型开源模型增加推理时间计算并测试其效果，同时研究放宽隐藏假设后对安全的影响，从直观和实证角度验证逆缩放规律。

Result: 发现推理时间扩展对开源模型也有益，但如果中间推理公开，会反而降低模型鲁棒性，并指出一些实际攻击方式仍对隐藏推理链模型有威胁。

Conclusion: 推理时间扩展的鲁棒性改进效果依赖于对抗设置和部署场景，在应用于安全敏感场景时需权衡。

Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time
computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this
paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1,
Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a
simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically
examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are
hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important
security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse
scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,
increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.
Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning
chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated
reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively
demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend
heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge
practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying
inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

*Xi Yang,Jiachen Wang,Song Han,Suining He*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BikeMAN的多级时空注意力神经网络，以预测城市中共享单车系统所有站点的流量，实验表明该方法准确度较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的城市共享单车系统面临站点级别供需不平衡的问题，导致系统维护复杂；需要一种有效的预测方法解决此挑战。

Method: 提出了一种多级时空注意力神经网络BikeMAN，结合了编码器和解码器框架，使用注意力机制同时表示站点间的空间相关性和时间流量特性。

Result: 通过对纽约市超过1000万次单车出行数据（>700个站点）的实验研究，BikeMAN在预测全市范围内所有站点的流量方面表现出了较高的准确性。

Conclusion: BikeMAN能够解决共享单车系统预测中的时空复杂性问题，并在确保准确性的前提下适用于大规模站点的预测。

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is
challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes
the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have
been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and
return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level
traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of
bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike
sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.
To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention
neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing
systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an
attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of
bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the
temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on
over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York
City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic
of all stations in the city.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个统一框架，用于对比和理解形式语言及自然语言两种不同的问题解决范式，并通过引入信任指数Q以及统计性质量维度来定义自然语言问题的解决方案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算对明确问题有优势，但对模糊、动态和主观性问题难以触及。本研究旨在填补形式计算与自然语言处理之间的理解鸿沟，通过分析LLMs如何解决自然语言问题。

Method: 通过建立一个框架，定义形式语言问题与自然语言问题的可解决空间；引入信任指数Q，区分形式解的二值正确性与自然语言解的连续充足光谱；提出统计质量维度，包括双语义熵和情感效价，以量化自然语言解的鲁棒性与主观价值。

Result: 框架通过信任指数Q揭示形式问题和自然语言问题的本质差异，并用统计性测量方法定义解决方案质量，展示如何量化LLMs在自然语言问题中的能力与局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的概念和方法加深了对LLMs在自然语言问题解决中的潜力、限制及本质特性的理解，为未来进一步研究奠定理论基础。

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the
engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be
described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean
of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,
and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to
engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This
paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these
problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces
addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the
former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter
requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking
into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural
language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects
solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions
from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language
solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality
dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual
diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.
Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable
metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts
introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the
capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of
LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了一种扩展约束逻辑编程（CLP）的方法，该扩展支持在规则体中使用否定，并提供了基于近似不动点理论的语义框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLP扩展方法虽然涵盖了模糊满足、不确定性等，但未能研究在规则体中包含否定的情况。

Method: 使用近似不动点理论框架，定义支持规则体中包含否定的CLP扩展语义，并分析半环属性对语义的影响。

Result: 提出了一种统一的框架，不仅能够捕捉已有方法，还支持更具表达能力的逻辑语言扩展。

Conclusion: 新方法兼容现有CLP扩展，同时因引入否定与近似不动点理论，提升了语言的表现力，为进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to
solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource
allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been
extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint
satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring
being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these
extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We
investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and
allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the
framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the
impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we
provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows
extending them with a more expressive language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为ChatBattery的新框架，结合领域知识来优化大型语言模型在材料设计中的推理能力，成功开发出性能显著提升的锂离子电池正极材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型已在数学和编码问题的推理方面展示出巨大潜力，但在电池材料领域的应用尚属未探索领域，因此有必要通过新的方法扩展模型的能力。

Method: 提出ChatBattery框架，将领域知识融入到大型语言模型的推理过程中，实现高效的材料设计及发现。

Result: 利用ChatBattery框架，发现并合成了三种新型锂离子电池正极材料，分别比现有商用材料NMC811的容量提高了28.8%、25.2%和18.5%。

Conclusion: ChatBattery展示了一个完整的人工智能驱动循环，从设计到合成再到表征，证明了AI推理在加速和颠覆材料发现领域的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to
tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in
artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have
primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their
potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely
unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided
search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates
domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials
design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and
characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve
practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over
the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this
discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and
reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete
AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the
transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials
discovery.

Motivation: 研究动机在于评估和提升AI在处理个税申报这一复杂任务中的实际能力，发现任务中的具体挑战。

Method: 开发了TaxCalcBench基准，通过提供所有必要信息来测试AI模型计算美国联邦所得税申报的能力。

Result: 实验表明，先进模型在简化数据集上仅能正确计算不到三分之一的申报。分析发现其在使用税率表、税务计算和资格确认上存在错误。

Conclusion: 当前的AI模型还无法胜任复杂的个人所得税申报任务，未来需要构建更强大的基础设施以支持这一应用。

Abstract: Can AI file your taxes? Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a
task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text
and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench,
a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax
returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that
state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal
income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes
that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and
incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for
additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation
task.

*Shuhao Mei,Yongchao Long,Shan Cao,Xiaobo Han,Shijia Geng,Jinbo Sun,Yuxi Zhou,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对慢性阻塞性肺疾病（COPD）的诊断难点提出了一种新的多模态大语言模型SpiroLLM，该模型能够分析肺功能测试中的时间序列数据并生成诊断报告，同时提供解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前COPD的AI诊断模型多为黑箱模型，缺乏解释性，且大语言模型无法处理时间序列的呼吸曲线数据，导致其在临床上的信任度和使用程度较低。作者希望通过结合多模态数据，改善这一问题。

Method: 提出一种名为SpiroLLM的多模态大语言模型，包括SpiroEncoder用于提取呼吸曲线的形态特征，及SpiroProjector用于将其与数值数据对齐到统一的潜在空间中，从而为语言模型生成综合诊断报告。

Result: 实验结果表明，SpiroLLM对COPD的诊断AUROC达到0.8980（95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132）。在数据缺失情况下，模型仍保持100%的有效响应率，远高于纯文本模型的13.4%。

Conclusion: 本文证明了将生理信号深度融合至大语言模型中的巨大潜力，为下一代具有解释性和可靠性的临床决策支持工具奠定了基础，并提出了新的研究和应用范式。

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

### [146] [Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind (A Position Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究发现了实用AI代理架构Agentic Flow与四大心智能理论之间的结构性收敛，这些理论包括Kahneman的双系统理论、Friston的预测处理理论、Minsky的心智能社会理论和Clark的扩展心智能理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了克服大语言模型（LLMs）的局限性，并探讨实践设计如何意外地显现认知理论的结构性特征。

Method: 设计了一个名为Agentic Flow的代理架构，由五个模块（检索、认知、控制、记忆和行动）组成一个递归认知回路，并与基准LLM代理在多步骤推理任务上进行了比较实验。

Result: Agentic Flow取得95.8%的任务成功率，与基准系统的62.3%相比表现出更强的约束遵守性，但该实验的目的不是证明其优越性，而是说明理论结构如何可能通过实践设计选择浮现。

Conclusion: 提出了一个名为PEACE的描述性元架构，用于概括在Agentic Flow中观察到的设计规律性，并作为理解实践需求影响架构的共享词汇。本研究是探索性反思，展示了如何通过实现揭示认知理论的潜在结构。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential
theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive
processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging
unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow.
Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow
comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control,
Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally
inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively
aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including
predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with
baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent
achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while
the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed
at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may
emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures
design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new
theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures
shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a
position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface
latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical
unification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个具有多功能可重构智能表面（MF-RIS）的空间-空中-地面综合网络(SAGIN)架构，用于提升能源效率(Energy Efficiency, EE)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研发新技术以解决低地球轨道(LEO)卫星在通信和计算过程中存在的能源短缺问题，同时充分发挥SAGIN各节点的综合作用。

Method: 通过使用CHIMERA框架（结合语义状态-动作压缩和参数化共享的混合强化学习），对 MF-RIS 和 SAGIN 参数联合优化，解决高度非凸、非线性问题及混合离散-连续变量优化。

Result: 仿真实验表明，与传统基线方法及不同RIS部署方式相比，CHIMERA能显著提升EE。SAGIN-MF-RIS架构在设计中实现了最佳能源效率性能，且综合性覆盖优于单独的卫星、空中或地面部署。

Conclusion: 融合SAGIN与MF-RIS以及CHIMERA优化框架的设计，为提升长效能源效率提供了有效解决方案，并展现了其在多种网络场景中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLMs的机密模型和数据在类似电路设计任务中的应用，提出了安全性和效率的挑战。

Method: 通过TEE环境中的LLMs性能评估（包括CPU、CPU-GPU混合与TEE环境），研究压缩模型（如DeepSeek）和低比特量化对性能的影响。

Result: 轻量化模型如DeepSeek表现优异，低比特量化（Q4、Q8）提升性能达3倍。同时，TDX实现也优于CPU版本。

Conclusion: 有效地在资源受限系统上部署轻量化LLMs在半导体CAD应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks
and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained
models and their associated training data are considered confidential
intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential
Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations
are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.
In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a
TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel
Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three
environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and
evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other
models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for
resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit
quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain
of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer
parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms
the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We
further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.
These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying
lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD
applications.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a
transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital
health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model
(LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous
patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights
from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and
Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an
economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective
healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our
pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\%
expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over
traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time
conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy
compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding
regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that
AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency
but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare
executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for
routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to
prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing
current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory
frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for
equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in
problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks.
However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web
retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel
insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we
introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the
capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI
Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a
dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific
scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different
AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature
review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric
assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality,
with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and
coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and
baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep
Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in
open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step
toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We
open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting
the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了蒸馏过程中的大域问题，显著提高了模型的泛化能力，同时降低了多模态学习数据需求的限制。

Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or
efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the
model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer
and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited
access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning
by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a
student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via
distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely
differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce
a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained
loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can
easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we
propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature
level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a
quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified
data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on
speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that
our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the
commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

Method: 通过系统综述量化31篇LLM评估论文并识别19个英语医学QA基准，用肯尼亚临床实践指南开发Alama Health QA，并评估6个常用基准测试的表现。

Result: Alama Health QA在NTD提及率和非洲疾病负担的代表性方面占优，特别是在疟疾、HIV和结核病中表现突出。其他全球性基准在非洲疾病负担的体现上不足。

Conclusion: 现有全球性医学LLM基准未能充分体现非洲疾病负担与背景。区域性、指南导向的资源如Alama Health QA对非洲医疗系统中的模型评估和部署尤为关键。

Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination
syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about
their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell
disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and
national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31
quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English
medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval
augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,
MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized
semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity
metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,
guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural
fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora
and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB
(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global
benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in
three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for
relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.
Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature
underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking
misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources
such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential
for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health
systems.

Motivation: 当前Kilkari项目中随机呼叫时间安排导致大量未接电话，降低了信息传递效果，亟需一种更高效的时间安排方法。

Method: 设计并部署了一种协作式赌博机算法，通过学习个体偏好来优化呼叫时间，并与随机呼叫方式进行对比实验。

Result: 实验表明，该算法显著提高了电话接听率，与随机呼叫方式相比在统计上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 基于个性化的呼叫时间优化能够增强移动健康干预效果，并证明机器学习技术在大规模母婴健康宣传中的潜力。

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
health information, particularly targeting underserved communities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate
crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes
through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program
delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions
of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed
calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a
collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning
individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around
$6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the
baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm,
indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of
mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized
scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of
machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.

### [155] [Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models: A Framework for Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16370)
*Lucas de Lara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，通过反事实模型来表示与因果图模型兼容的反事实概念，并提供了规范化程序来实现多种反事实描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理在因果分析中具有最细化的层级，尽管其声明难以验证，但在个人公平性等基本概念中意义重大。现有方法如结构化因果模型存在局限性，因此需要新的模型框架来更好地表达和实施反事实信念。

Method: 作者提出了基于Pearl因果框架下的反事实模型，并称为结构化因果模型的规范性表示，以通过随机过程概率分布与指定边缘概率来选择反事实概念，并推导反事实等价类。此外，提出了一种规范化过程来描述并实现各种反事实概念，而无需改变观察和干预条件。

Result: 新方法允许在不改变观测和干预限制的情况下定义多种反事实概念，并且无需估计模型中的反事实层，仅需要做出选择。

Conclusion: 该方法为因果推理提供了更灵活且高效的工具，特别是在理论和数值应用中，展现了表现反事实的具体重要性和优势。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like
''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the
most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual
statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they
underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore,
providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a
fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal
framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to
represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More
precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical
representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a
counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with
preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of
structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to
describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to
structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions
without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover,
the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not
need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the
specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach
on theoretical and numerical examples.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ColaUntangle是一种用于拆分开发者混杂提交的新框架，结合了LLM驱动的多代理架构和多版本程序依赖图（delta-PDG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者由于实际约束或界限不清，经常提交混杂的、涉及多个开发关切点的代码，这种做法影响代码审查和维护，因此需要提升现有拆分方法的效果。

Method: 提出ColaUntangle框架，结合三种LLM代理分别专注于显式和隐式依赖关系及聚合审查，并使用delta-PDG来捕捉多维度的代码关系信息。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，ColaUntangle的性能显著优于最佳基线模型，其中包括C#数据集提升44%，Java数据集提升100%。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的协作框架在自动化代码提交拆分任务中展现了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a
best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce
tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or
unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although
prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,
have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish
between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones
(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose
ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling
that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.
ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a
multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,
another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives
through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual
information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),
enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and
semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#
and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle
outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on
the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit
untangling tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型自监督ILP方法，名为Poker，可在缺乏问题特定背景理论和负例的情况下，通过生成新的例子进行学习，取得了优于现有系统Louise的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望解决传统ILP方法需要依赖专家知识设计背景理论和负例的问题，探索在缺乏问题特定背景理论和负例的情况下，如何有效地学习逻辑程序。

Method: 提出了一种新的Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL)算法，通过从正例和未标注例子中学习，自动生成和标注新的正例与负例，并将其实施在新系统Poker中。此外，提出了选择背景理论的第二阶规范形式(SONF)方法，减少对特定任务背景理论的需求。

Result: 通过实验比较，发现Poker在生成更多自动例子时表现更好，而Louise在缺乏负例的情况下容易产生过度泛化问题。

Conclusion: 新算法和系统Poker证明了在缺乏负例和部分背景理论的条件下，依然可以通过自动生成新的标注数据，实现有效的递归逻辑程序学习。

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive
Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with
invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability
relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected
with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such
a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We
formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a
new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled,
and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels,
new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm
in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to
state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for
Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no
negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in
examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for
the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order
Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a
class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning
task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of
automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples,
over-generalises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因训练数据引发的法律、伦理问题，以及现有训练数据检测方法表现较差的问题。

Method: 提出NA-PDD算法，基于神经元激活模式分析训练数据与非训练数据的差异，并引入时间上无偏的CCNewsPDD基准。

Result: NA-PDD在三个基准和多种LLM上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NA-PDD是一种高效的训练数据检测方法，能够改善目前LLM训练数据检测的不足问题。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their
training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information,
raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for
dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the
Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific
data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD
methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss,
resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a
novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between
training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that
these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also
introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data
transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and
non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly
outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

Motivation: 在新环境下自主行动的智能体需兼具模型驱动预测与无模型直接行动的能力。

Result: 经过实验验证，求解器解决的问题也能由控制器解决，表明两者等效。

Conclusion: 模型驱动求解器与无模型控制器在问题解决能力上是等价的，实现了两种智能体能力的结合。

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the
effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use
its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but
must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can
act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An
autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must
combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with
Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a
model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver.
We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on
grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes,
and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved
by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are
equivalent.

Conclusion: 通過結合歸納和演繹技術提升了手術室排程的效率和穩健性，可作為解決真實醫療數據問題的基礎。

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of
daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to
many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries
and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in
different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer
Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall
satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify
whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest
alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is
not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the
resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving
these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the
surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,
we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our
problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust
schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm
the viability of our integration.

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法在复杂逻辑推理基准和运动任务中表现出色，验证了其框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 作者的框架为语言和控制领域抽象技能的学习提供了一种有力的方法，同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step
textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this,
we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the
model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every
step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as
temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of
options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian
Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference
within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these
options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP
homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract
latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the
solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start
procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human
reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich
initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical
reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework
as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在软件开发和迁移中，跨编程语言的代码翻译至关重要。现有方法灵活性和扩展性不足，而专有的语言模型虽然效果好，但数据安全和依赖性成问题，因而需要一种更开放且高效的方法。

Method: 提出了ACT框架，该框架包括一个自动化的流程，从初始代码样本生成高质量的合成数据、使用单元测试保证准确性和多样性，并通过执行级别的质量检测评估翻译效果。此外，其控制模块可以动态调整超参数并智能优化训练过程。

Result: ACT显著提高了开源模型的翻译性能。在实际的行业迁移项目中，通过数据生成管道，开发者的效率明显提升。

Conclusion: ACT提供了一种安全可靠的开源解决方案，既提升了翻译性能，又减少了对闭源专有工具的依赖。

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in
developer acceleration.

Conclusion: INRAExplorer在专业领域成功验证了RAG系统的潜力，为知识密集型领域的复杂查询处理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering
limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or
navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in
knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system
for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an
LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich
knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open
access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct
iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all
publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver
structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete
illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.

Motivation: 推动对人工智能（AI）快速发展的潜在重大风险的识别与理解，为其可能带来的前沿风险提供全面评估。

Method: 采用Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0)中的E-T-C分析方法，即从部署环境、威胁来源、使能能力三方面分析AI风险，并引入“红线”和“黄线”定义风险区域，分别用于表示无法容忍的风险阈值与早期预警指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，最近的前沿AI模型大多位于绿色和黄色风险区域，未触及高风险的红线区域，但部分模型因其潜在能力和威胁特征在特定领域触及了黄区，包括说服与操控以及可能的生化威胁问题。

Conclusion: 当前前沿AI技术虽未突破不可容忍的风险阈值，但其潜在威胁尤为值得警惕，需集体采取行动以有效减轻这些挑战。

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly
lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations,
and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges
can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search
space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for
large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also
be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive
cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial
assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing
assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most
existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment
for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and
resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper
proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which
ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training
time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed
by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced.
A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted,
offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly
lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently
provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network
that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating
significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a
comparable model-based approach.

production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to
these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or
stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level
of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To
bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of
agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing
effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit
throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases
due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes
challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of
solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL
approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed
algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their
interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing
profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,
and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with
continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the
inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the
empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is
considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the
proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and
lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for
policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively
under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为wgrammar的轻量级解码引擎，能显著提升大语言模型(LLMs)生成结构化输出的效率，尤其适用于HTML或JSON格式的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构解码方法存在效率瓶颈，研究人员希望通过新的方法提升大语言模型生成结构化输出的速度和精度，满足下游任务的需求。

Method: 将约束分解为静态和动态组件，预编译静态结构，并在运行时通过语法片段应用动态约束。此外，采用组合操作符取代上下推自动机，并引入约束分解与掩码缓存技术开发解码引擎wgrammar。

Result: wgrammar显著提高了解码效率，与现有系统相比，速度提升最高可达250倍。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的解码策略与轻量化引擎，wgrammar有效地优化了大语言模型在输出结构化数据时的效率与精确度，为实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs
in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However,
existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation,
state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed
strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a
decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling
static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using
grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a
compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower
transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that
integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask
caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source
code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

### [169] [ChatChecker: A Framework for Dialogue System Testing and Evaluation Through Non-cooperative User Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16792)
*Roman Mayr,Michel Schimpf,Thomas Bohné*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ChatChecker，一个用于对复杂对话系统进行自动化评估和测试的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对话系统评估方法存在局限，大多仅对底层的语言模型或逐回合的对话交互进行分析，而缺乏对整个系统的集成质量评估。

Method: ChatChecker通过引入一个基于LLM的用户模拟系统来实现多样化的用户交互，同时结合错误分类提示提高对对话系统中断的侦测能力。另外，还设计了基于挑战性人物的非合作用户模拟器以更有效地暴露系统弱点。

Result: 与以往方法相比，ChatChecker在检测对话中断方面取得了更高的表现，同时无需参考对话内容或对目标系统的具体实现依赖。

Conclusion: ChatChecker为全面而可扩展的对话系统测试提供了一种创新框架，有助于加速更鲁棒的对话系统开发。

Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),
their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers
integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment
of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be
tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With
most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been
paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we
present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of
complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user
interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to
previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as
it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the
implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection
performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in
the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator
based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue
systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and
scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate
the development of robust dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种整合不确定性预测与多智能体强化学习的新型P2P能源交易框架，通过引入基于概率的预测模型和自定义优化策略，实现更高效、可靠的交易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前P2P能源交易对确定性预测依赖过多，缺乏对不确定性的考量。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提升决策鲁棒性。

Method: 利用异方差概率Transformer模型“KTU”量化预测不确定性，并整合到多智能体强化学习框架中，采用定制化损失函数进行训练。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在无P2P交易时将购电成本降低5.7%，有P2P交易时降低3.2%；电力销售收入分别增加6.4%与44.7%；削减了38.8%与45.6%的高峰时段电网需求。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知预测与P2P交易机制的协同作用显著提高了能源社区的经济效益与灵活性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading
that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast
to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach
employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model
called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify
prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the
stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages
domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that
ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each
prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL
framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear
understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the
uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to
5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing
electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak
hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These
improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting
the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,
economically efficient energy communities.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为Fast-VAT的改进算法，通过使用Numba和Cython显著提高了VAT算法性能，达到了50倍的加速效果，同时保留了原始输出的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前VAT算法在评估无监督数据集的聚类结构时具有广泛应用，但由于其O(n^2)的时间复杂度和资源使用效率低下，存在显著性能限制，因此需要提出更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于Python的高性能VAT算法实现Fast-VAT，结合了Numba的即时编译（JIT）和Cython的静态类型及底层内存优化技术，从而显著提高执行效率。

Result: Fast-VAT在一系列真实和合成数据集（例如Iris，购物顾客数据和Spotify子集）上验证了其聚类趋势，并通过Hopkins统计量、PCA和t-SNE验证了其有效性，同时与DBSCAN和K-Means聚类结果进行比较，证实了可靠性。

Conclusion: Fast-VAT在保留输出保真度的同时，显著提升了性能，为探索数据集的聚类结构提供了一种快速可靠的工具。

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised
technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.
However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance
limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In
this work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT
algorithm in Python, augmented with Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and
Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach
achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving
the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of
real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify
subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and
t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering
results from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.

TL;DR: 提出一种称为CAPS（综合申请人档案评分）的框架，用于量化和解释大学招生的整体评估，采用学术成绩、文章质量和课外活动影响三方面指标，使用先进的机器学习方法实现高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大学招生评审方法具有不透明、不一致的问题，申请人可能感受到不公平和焦虑，因此需要一个更加清晰和公平的评价方法。

Method: 通过引入CAPS框架，将申请人档案分解为学术成绩（SAS）、文章质量（EQI）和课外参与（EIS）这三个可解释的组成部分，利用transformer嵌入、LLM打分和XGBoost回归等技术进行评估。

Result: 在一个模拟的真实数据集上，EQI预测的R^2达到0.80，分类准确率超过75%，宏F1得分为0.69，权重F1得分为0.74，表现出色。

Conclusion: CAPS能有效改善传统大学招生评估的问题，提供更加透明和数据驱动的决策流程，为实现公平的招生实践铺路。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a
novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret
holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles
into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized
Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and
extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging
transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression,
CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human
judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong
performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy
over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS
addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the
opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way
for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法无法有效处理临床缩写、隐含疾病提及、隐私问题及临床推理能力不足的局限性。

Method: 提出RDMA框架，通过本地化分析和临床推理，结合零散的临床观察信息，识别罕见疾病模式。

Result: RDMA相比传统方法提升了F1性能30%，并将推理成本降低10倍，同时减少隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: RDMA框架能显著改善从EHR中挖掘罕见疾病信息的效率和隐私保护，支持罕见疾病的早期诊断，帮助医疗工作者。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using
cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems,
supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. Available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补超网络研究中资源匮乏的空缺，推动超网络领域的深入研究。

Method: 生成了 $10^4$ 个 LeNet-5 二值图像分类神经网络，采用超过 $10^4$ 核的计算集群进行训练，并分类成10类以供研究。

Result: 生成的数据集中的神经网络通过监督学习算法分类达到72%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该数据集为超网络研究提供了开放资源，旨在提高对生成神经网络的研究能力。

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的提示设计常依赖启发式方法，不易规模化。本研究旨在通过自动化提示优化（APO）应对这一挑战，尤其在高复杂度任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出APE-OPRO，一个结合APE和OPRO优势的混合框架，优化了成本效益。同时，对比了多种APO方法，并研究了参数和标签格式对模型性能的影响。

Result: APE-OPRO在成本效益上显著优于OPRO（约18%改善），且结果优于或接近基于梯度的ProTeGi方法。此外，研究展示了提示优化对标签格式和参数敏感性的重要性。

Conclusion: APE-OPRO在API成本、性能和可扩展性之间实现了平衡，为商业场景的提示优化提供了有效工具，并为未来研究多标签与多模态优化提供了基础。

Abstract: Prompt design is a critical factor in the effectiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs), yet remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale.
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass
classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only
on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.
  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the
complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better
cost-efficiency, around $18\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing
performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and
gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.
  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute
performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted
in~\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between
performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation
studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to
label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These
findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial
applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label,
vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有离散流模型在数据生成时因多步解码过程导致的速度瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出一种基于条件总相关（Conditional Total Correlation, TC）的优化方法，通过矫正源目标分布之间的耦合关系，减少因子化误差，并提供理论证明及单步模型训练支持。

Result: 实验表明，ReDi方法显著降低条件总相关，支持高效的少步生成，并适用于单步模型的图像生成训练。

Conclusion: ReDi方法为加速离散数据生成提供了可靠且简单的解决方案，开辟了高效生成的新视角。

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

Motivation: 旨在解决标准VAE在潜在空间维度较高时，随机生成有意义数据的效果差的现象。

Method: 通过对潜在变量采用超球面坐标进行参数化，将拉伸分布压缩到超球面上的“岛”上以减少潜在稀疏性，提高生成能力。

Result: 提出了一种新型潜在空间参数化方法，该方法几乎不增加计算开销，同时改进了VAE生成能力。

Conclusion: 改良后的VAE方法通过更好的潜在空间配置改善了高维空间中的数据生成效果。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a
random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data,
at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper,
we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:
in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction
distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent
variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing
the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the
latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the
VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited
computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有的智能代理在与开放环境交互时，由于LLMs的幻觉问题，产生的输出可能与事实不符，从而影响其可靠性。有效检测和缓解幻觉是让智能代理在现实世界中安全应用的前提。

Method: 引入HalMit黑箱监测框架，通过概率分形采样生成大量查询，以并行检测智能代理的泛化界限，从而无需内部模型知识即可识别幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，HalMit能够显著提升幻觉检测的效果，与现有方法相比具有显著优势。

Conclusion: HalMit凭借其黑箱特性和优秀性能，为提升LLM驱动系统的可靠性提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方差感知政策优化框架能够显著提升现有基于偏好的对齐方法的稳定性，有效缓解奖励模型不稳定带来的性能问题。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动神经符号AI的发展，但KG自动化构建面临可靠性、一致性和可验证性挑战，如数据孤岛或抽象类与具体实例的混淆问题。

Method: 构建HyDRA架构，通过协作式神经符号代理生成本体，利用‘按契约设计’原则控制大语言模型生成过程，并提出评估框架对KG的功能正确性进行验证。

Result: 实现了自动KG构建的可靠性改进，并提出了一个创新性的方法来评估其功能完整性。

Conclusion: HyDRA为KG自动化构建提供了一种可靠的解决方案，并探讨了其输出的功能完整性验证方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications
as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This
work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of
automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for
measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了压缩方法对大型语言模型解释性的影响，并探讨了在压缩前后使用稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）的差异，发现可以通过直接剪枝原始SAE来降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的推理效率问题日益显著，现有的压缩方法解决了模型规模问题，但不清楚它们如何影响模型的可解释性。通过研究，这项工作关注压缩对解释性的特定模块（如稀疏自动编码器）的影响，以平衡效率和可解释性。

Method: 研究了稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）在原始与压缩模型间的表现差异，包括直接使用原始模型的SAE处理压缩模型，以及对原始SAE进行剪枝来适配压缩模型。

Result: 发现原始模型的SAE虽然会有部分性能下降，但可以解释压缩模型。同时，通过对原始SAE本身进行剪枝可以获得与直接为压缩模型训练新的SAE相当的表现。

Conclusion: 通过直接剪枝原始SAE，可以减少为压缩模型重新训练SAE的计算成本，同时仍能保证一定的解释性能。

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of
SAEs.

Motivation: 传统的高斯过程校准方法未能充分捕获深度神经网络的层次结构，局限了解释性与预测可靠性评估的效果，故提出改进方法。

Method: 提出 SAL-GP 框架，通过多层高斯过程模型校准神经网络的每一层特征表示，利用多层核结构耦合各层以实现联合边缘化。

Result: SAL-GP 能捕获局部语义依赖和全局校准一致性，同时保证了预测不确定性的有效传播。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了校准的解释性和一致性评价能力，可用于深度模型中的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

Motivation: 研究神经切线核（NTK）在数据分布随时间变化情况下的动态行为，以揭示其对持续学习的潜在影响。

Method: 进行全面的实证分析，研究持续学习中的数据分布迁移对NTK动态的作用和表现。

Result: 表明持续学习是研究神经网络训练动态的丰富测试环境，同时挑战了静态核近似在持续学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 在大规模持续学习中，静态核近似可能不再适用，强调了研究NTK动态的必要性。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

Conclusion: 该研究为三值神经网络的实用性提供了理论支持，解释了其在实际应用中的成功原因。

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative
disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response.
Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately
forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we
present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized
modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging,
biomarker, and clinical data. Unlike conventional models with prespecified
dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators
governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration
biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware
neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a
digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions,
simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied
to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90%
across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches.
This work offers a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and
personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.

Result: 实验表明，DWM可以提升随机选择数据训练模型的性能，并能迁移应用于其他数据选择方法及不同规模模型。

Conclusion: 通过研究数据偏好的演变规律，本方法提供了优化数据使用并提升语言模型训练效率的新思路。

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model
(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a
dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对长远依赖与数据质量问题，在自动竞价任务中表现优越。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

Result: 评估显示，即使是性能较优的LLM o1-preview，在模块级任务上仅达到13.3%的通过率，在系统级任务上是0%，反映模型性能的局限性。

Conclusion: RealBench为评估和推动更强大的Verilog代码生成模型奠定了基础，但当前模型远未达到实际需求。

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)
has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in
replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity,
inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments.
To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming
at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex,
structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design
specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line
coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and
system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities.
Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the
best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level
tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, highlighting the need for stronger Verilog
generation models in the future. The benchmark is open-sourced at

Result: METER涵盖更广泛的模态，提供更丰富的解释性度量，如时空IoU、多类别追踪和证据一致性。

Conclusion: METER可作为发展生成媒体中伪造检测的标准化基石。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子表征方法（如SMILES字符串、分子图等）难以捕捉驱动分子间行为的表面现象，而3D方法往往计算成本高或信息简化严重，需要一种能更好表示分子表面的新方法。

Method: 提出了AMPTCR表征方法，将局部量子衍生的标量场、拓扑向量以及标准参考框架中对齐的点云格式结合，利用DGCNN架构进行模型的构建与训练。

Result: 在分子量预测任务上，得到验证集R^2为0.87；在细菌生长抑制任务分类中ROC AUC为0.912，回归中R^2为0.54。

Conclusion: AMPTCR是一种紧凑、表达力强且与架构无关的分子表征方法，可有效建模与表面相关的分子属性。

Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on
representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook
the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了STWeaver，一种新型GPU内存分配器，可以显著减少内存碎片并提升深度学习模型的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GPU内存分配方式面对训练优化技术和大模型规模时，存在内存浪费且导致内存不足问题。

Method: 通过结合离线规划与在线分配的方式，利用时空规律优化内存分配，同时能处理复杂动态模型。

Result: STWeaver平均减少内存碎片79.2%，最高可达100%，实现训练吞吐量提升并提高性能达32.5%。

Conclusion: STWeaver显著提高了内存效率，为更高效的深度学习训练配置提供了可能性。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究低容量网络在容量、稀疏性和鲁棒性之间的关系，以加深对简单神经网络的基本权衡的理解。

Method: 设计了一系列基于MNIST数据集中不同视觉难度的二分类任务，实验分析了网络容量和稀疏性对鲁棒性的影响，并通过显著性图进行可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 本文通过一个制定的实验框架，清晰且实证地揭示了简单神经网络容量、稀疏性和鲁棒性之间的基本权衡关系。

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像的同时，也继承了有毒训练数据的不良行为，对其进行安全医学卸载后，在下游微调中易失去效果，亟需方法改善这个问题。

Method: 提出ResAlign框架，基于Moreau Envelope重新建模下游微调问题，并设计了一个元学习策略以提高模型对下游微调场景的泛化能力。

Result: ResAlign在实验中表现出色，在保留安全性和非有害性生成能力方面，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResAlign提高了现有安全卸载方法在下游微调后的鲁棒性，是解决这一问题的有效工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

Motivation: 尽管钙钛矿太阳能电池具有高功率转换效率，但其商业化仍受限于长期稳定性、环境可持续性和可扩展生产等问题，迫切需要高效整合领域知识的新工具。

Method: 通过系统性挖掘和整理1,232篇高质量科学文献，并整合33,269种候选材料，构建了领域特定的指令调优数据集，以链式思维推理和自动问答生成为基础，微调QwQ-32B模型生成Perovskite-R1。

Conclusion: 本文证明了针对领域适配的大型语言模型在加速材料发现中的潜力，同时提供了一种闭环框架，用于钙钛矿光伏研究的数据驱动创新。

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

Motivation: 研究现有压缩技术中的对抗样本问题，并探索其脆弱性，尤其是在用于$l_2$范数估计时的低维度表示攻击。

Method: 提出了一种非自适应攻击方法，通过约O(k^2)次黑箱查询，针对任何线性压缩技术和估计器，包括随机、自适应或定制的响应估计器。

Result: 证明了这种攻击方法在$l_2$范数估计任务中的有效性，并与Johnson Lindenstrauss 变换和AMS技术的性能一致。

Conclusion: 此研究揭示了压缩表现的脆弱性，尤其是与图像分类中对抗攻击的结构性相似，为对压缩技术的鲁棒性理解提供了新见解。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络假设同配性，但在异配性图中表现不佳，需要一种新方法应对长范围及异配性图问题。

Method: HPGNN结合个性化PageRank高阶近似与卷积网络，捕获多尺度节点交互，降低计算复杂性及降噪。

Conclusion: HPGNN能平衡多尺度信息处理及抗噪能力，对现实世界的图学习问题提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法CenSurv，用于癌症患者生存预测，解决了以往研究忽视截尾样本及多模态缺失场景中的性能问题。

Motivation: 当前癌症生存预测研究未充分利用截尾样本，并在多模态缺失场景及推理过程中表现不佳。

Method: 设计了一种基于双分图的患者-模态图学习方法，结合事件条件截尾建模，通过图结构建模多模态数据，采用模态齐全-缺失对齐策略处理多模态缺失问题，并引入事件条件截尾建模模块选择可靠的截尾数据提高预测表现。

Result: 在5个公开癌症数据集上，CenSurv平均C-index比当前最优方法提升3.1%，在多模态缺失场景下表现出优秀的鲁棒性，同时事件条件截尾建模模块使8个基线方法的平均C-index提升约1.3%。

Conclusion: CenSurv通过创新的患者-模态图学习和事件条件截尾建模，显著提升了癌症生存预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

Motivation: 先前研究过于依赖过参数化，但此方法需要网络宽度随样本数量增长，计算成本高且不现实，本研究旨在避免这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种分析两层PINNs的SGD优化与泛化性能的新方法，并通过对目标函数的假设避免过参数化。

Result: 证明当网络宽度超过一个与精度 $epsilon$ 和问题相关的阈值时，可以将训练损失和期望损失降至 $O(epsilon)$ 以下。

Conclusion: 本研究减少了过参数化的依赖，为在特定宽度约束的网络中实现高效SGD优化和泛化提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

Conclusion: 利用合成数据进行上采样是一种有效的方法，可以填补特征空间中稀疏区域的数据空白，进一步增强预测模型在少数类上的表现。

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

Result: 通过大量仿真验证，提出的联合均衡策略在多种信道条件和场景下均优于传统物理和语义信道分离处理的方法。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的联合物理与语义均衡方法显著提升了多用户MIMO系统的通信效率和理解能力，为语义通信未来发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Conclusion: 本文为基于相关性模式的聚类验证提供了新的方法论基础，特别适用于包括健康、金融和工业在内的高风险领域。

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: 类比和模块化构建可以增强模型的灵活性和计算效率，为未知领域的高效导航提供可能的理论支持。

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be
useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment
that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must
be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a
central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code can be

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is
encoded through structured message passing, where node, edge, and attribute
information are bound and bundled into a symbolic hypervector. This process
preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from
node attributes to edge relations to structural roles resulting in a compact,
discrete representation. We also formulate a local interpretability framework
which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating
competitive accuracy with strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has
emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing
the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and
preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have
contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning
(FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that
emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric
perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data
properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is
critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to
enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric
taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the
structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data
Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to
overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three
orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration.
Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large
Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction
aligned with emerging trends in GML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对CW复形进行学习的合适机器学习方法，需要有效的度量和工具来处理其结构和特征信息。

Method: 基于Hodge-Laplacian矩阵推导出细胞复形信号分布的Wasserstein距离，并将融合的Gromov-Wasserstein距离扩展到CW复形，进一步基于优化传输的对偶形式提出新核函数。

Result: 为CW复形构建了优化的分布比较方法，与结构特征有效结合，确保了学习上的结构意义。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为CW复形的机器学习开辟了新途径，显著加强了其结构与特征的联合处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning
representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods
suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit
expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal
distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a
structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal
transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and
structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW
complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

TL;DR: Transformer架构由于计算复杂度和内存增长问题，在长上下文场景下表现受限。提出了通过稀疏状态更新和Sparse State Expansion (SSE) 进行上下文压缩的新方法，兼顾效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在长上下文处理中的计算和内存瓶颈限制了其应用。因此，需要新解决方案来兼顾长距离上下文压缩的有效性和效率。

Method: 介绍了基于行稀疏更新的线性注意力公式，通过softmax-top-k分类实现稀疏更新，并提出Sparse State Expansion (SSE)，将上下文状态分隔为多个分区，从而提升性能并减少参数依赖。

Result: SSE在语言建模、上下文检索和数学推理基准测试中表现优异，在数学推理任务中超越同规模开源Transformer，取得SOTA表现。

Conclusion: SSE提供了一种高效且性能优越的长上下文建模架构，展现出广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式大语言模型(LLM)的推荐系统，通过元学习框架实现快速冷启动用户个性化，结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐系统在冷启动用户情况下适应性差，且维护和更新成本高。

Method: 通过元学习框架进行参数高效的prompt微调，结合第一阶(Reptile)和第二阶(MAML)优化方法，为LLM推荐系统引入可学习的用户行为提示向量。

Result: 在MovieLens-1M、Amazon Reviews和Recbole数据集中，该方法在NDCG@10、HR@10和MRR评测指标上优于强基线模型；支持零历史个性化，适应速度达275 ms，有效提高金融系统的实时风险检测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法基于LLM的推荐系统能够快速适应冷启动用户，成本低、性能优越，对金融系统稳定和国家金融基础设施韧性有积极意义。

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

Motivation: 研究的动机在于改进基于Transformer注意机制的网络无法很好处理多分类任务及视觉绑定问题，旨在受神经科学启发，增强网络的功能。

Method: 构建了结合Transformer注意操作和神经科学“通过同步绑定”理论的机制，在卷积层中引入角相位，通过Kuramoto动力学实现相位对齐，增强同相位神经元间的操作、抑制反相位神经元间的干扰。

Result: 在两组数据集（数字对数据集及MNIST与CIFAR-10结合数据集）上实验表明，新方法在准确性、抗噪能力及泛化能力上均优于传统CNN网络。

Conclusion: 综合来看，这种结合神经科学与机器学习的新机制有效解决了神经网络中的视觉绑定问题，证明了其更好的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Motivation: 传统的算法基础容错技术（ABFT）无法有效处理完整的注意力机制，尤其是因为其中的softmax归一化操作的复杂性。

Method: 设计了一种名为Flash-ABFT的方法，通过在线校验和对注意力层中query、key和value矩阵的三矩阵乘法（包括softmax操作）进行检测，以单次校验完成故障检测。

Result: 实验结果表明，Flash-ABFT仅产生5.3%的硬件面积开销和不足1.9%的能量开销，同时保持较高的故障检测准确率。

Conclusion: Flash-ABFT为注意力加速器中的故障检测提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes
Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire
three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer,
including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach
significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while
maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9%
energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error
detection in attention accelerators.

Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the
meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks
that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on
different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches
may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a
novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic
communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair
that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel
equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel
impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving
a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic
MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity
constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the
main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the
solutions.

Conclusion: FISHER通过统一建模解决工业信号分析的问题，并开辟了后续研究新方向，同时已开源用于进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多桌面应用程序无障碍支持不足，其开发者提供的元数据往往不完整或缺失。

Method: 通过使用视觉-语言模型和对象检测模型，检测、描述并组织用户界面元素，创建其类macOS层次级无障碍元数据，并提供了三个公开数据集。

Result: Screen2AX在完整无障碍树结构重建中获得77%的F1分数，并在任务基准中使自主代理性能提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: Screen2AX框架显著改进了复杂桌面界面的无障碍支持，超越现有方法，且其生成的无障碍树能有效提高AI代理的交互能力。

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据驱动AI时代，高质量的训练数据至关重要，而传统coreset方法无法针对分类性能（如F1分数）优化。

Method: 引入可调参数（如确定性采样、类别分配及主动采样），改进分类任务中的coreset生成流程。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的coreset在分类性能指标上显著优于传统coreset及全数据训练。

Conclusion: 优化后的coreset可有效提升分类性能，同时提高训练效率，为模型训练提供了新路径。

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

Conclusion: 提出的PSVGP模型在不显著增加计算和内存开销的情况下，提高了分布式数据分析中的预测平滑性与模型拟合质量。

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of
exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible
than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely
on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical
analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning
algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting
must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is
distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable
approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model
independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is
scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect
of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between
neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea
by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial
partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to
smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our
decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly
scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in
terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the
independent SVGP case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要修改训练数据来解决微调后意外泛化问题，但这在实践中并不总是可行。

Method: 提出了一种叫做概念消融微调（CAFT）的方法，通过解释工具识别LLMs潜在空间中不期望的概念方向，并在微调过程中通过线性投影剔除这些概念方向。

Result: 在三项微调任务中成功应用了CAFT，包括解决紧急对齐问题，实现了在无训练数据变动的情况下，将误对齐响应减少了10倍，同时没有降低训练集上的性能。

Conclusion: CAFT为在不更改训练数据的条件下，调整LLMs泛化表现提供了一种全新的思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

Conclusion: 显式地优化校准能够打造更可靠的推理模型，并利用训练中的置信估计在推理时改善准确性与校准。

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

Conclusion: SOPHIA显著提升了多模态推理能力，超越了监督微调和直接在线RL方法，为进一步在线训练提供了更好的策略初始化。

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.

Motivation: 探索尖峰神经网络是否能通过精确尖峰时间（而不仅是发放频率）进行学习，并评估其在各种生物启发的干扰下的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计合成任务和尖峰语音识别数据集（如SHD和SSC的变体），研究尖峰时间编码。使用替代梯度下降法训练SNNs，同时评估它们在各种扰动（如尖峰抖动、尖峰删除等）下的性能。

Result: 在消除尖峰计数信息的情况下，SNNs展现了超高随机水平的表现，而基于频率的模型仅达到随机水平。还发现SNNs对尖峰序列时间翻转非常敏感，特别是使用延迟训练的模型表现更接近人类行为。

Conclusion: SNNs能有效利用尖峰时间进行学习，并表现出一定的生物启发特性，其对时间编码的研究进展为未来研究拓宽了视野。

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained
with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay
learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first
design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and
cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based
speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech
Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is
eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate
GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely
rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under
biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or
per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but
perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when
spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from
SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in
terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have
released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.
