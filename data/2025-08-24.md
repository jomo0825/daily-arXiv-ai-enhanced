### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了面部标志点检测中的Soft-argmax方法，并提出了一种基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，能以更快的速度收敛并达到同等或更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部标志点检测方法广泛使用Soft-argmax进行端到端网络训练，然而其长期使用是否最优尚存疑。

Method: 提出一种替代训练目标，基于经典结构化预测框架以替代Soft-argmax的使用，并在多个基准测试上进行了验证。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个基准上取得了最新性能，同时相较于Soft-argmax的训练速度提高2.2倍。

Conclusion: 无需Soft-argmax也可以实现高性能，且训练效率更高，提出的方法为面部标志点检测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究结合图卷积网络（GCN）与Voronoi图以改进图像分类，并表现出在复杂场景与细粒度分类中的卓越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用GCN高效处理复杂数据结构的能力，结合Voronoi图提高图像分类的性能和精度。

Method: 通过将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域为顶点），结合Voronoi图和Delaunay三角化方法优化图表示，并综合使用GCNs进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同基准数据集上显著提升了分类精度和预处理效率，优于当前先进方法，尤其在复杂场景与细粒度分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 结合GCN与Voronoi图不仅为图像分类提供了新视角，还扩展了图学习在计算机视觉与非结构化数据分析中的潜在应用。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 单张RGB图像上的对象检测与9-DoF姿态估计被统一在单一框架中，无需额外数据，性能出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求不依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段流程、仅基于RGB, 在类别级别直接学习的高效姿态估计方法。

Method: 提出YOPO，一种基于查询的单阶段方法，通过添加轻量的姿态头、基于边框的平移模块、以及6D匹配损失，将类别级别9-DoF看作自然扩展，端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275等三大基准上表现出色，例如79.6% $m{IoU}_{50}$ 和54.1% $10^0$$10{m{cm}}$性能，显著超越以前仅RGB方法，并接近RGB-D系统。

Conclusion: 单阶段、类别级别的统一方法如YOPO不仅简化了方案，同时实现了RGB-only场景下的性能突破。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework的统一方法，有效解决面部识别中的物理攻击和数字伪造问题，并在实验中表现出优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了简化当前面部识别中的防攻击系统，并减轻系统复杂度和推理延迟，同时解决混合攻击的隐患，提出一种新的训练框架。

Method: 通过Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework训练，利用自动匹配的真实自拍和攻击自拍对，以学习跨模态的活体特征，无需针对特定模态或伪造手段单独训练模型。

Result: 在第六届面部防伪挑战赛中，平均分类错误率为2.10%，表现优于现有方法；模型轻量且在一小时内完成训练，具备实际部署的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了统一框架在防御物理和数字攻击中的有效性，同时兼具高效性和部署的可行性，提供了一个优化现实系统的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/xPONYx/iccv2025_deepfake_challenge.

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了TAIGen，一种高效的无训练黑盒对抗性图像生成方法，比现有扩散方法快10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的生成模型往往因为图像质量不高或计算资源需求大而限制了对抗样本的生成效率，尤其是扩散模型需要大量计算步数生成对抗样本。

Method: TAIGen利用无条件扩散模型，通过扰动混合步间隔生成对抗样本，并结合RGB通道选择策略，使用GradCAM引导扰动以达到高效攻击的效果。

Result: TAIGen在仅有3-20次采样步骤下便实现了高攻击成功率，保持了图像质量（PSNR > 30 dB），并在ImageNet测试中对多种模型（ResNet、MNASNet、ShuffleNet）表现出高攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TAIGen显著提高了扩散模型生成对抗样本的效率及效果，对现有防御机制的鲁棒性提出了新挑战。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ 提出一种可逆展开网络与生成式优化模型，针对隐蔽视觉感知 (CVP) 提出了新的解决方案，结合了数学优化与生成扩散模型的多阶段处理方法，提高了整体预测的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅限于掩模域处理，RGB 域的潜力尚未充分挖掘。需要一种结合多域的信息熵减少策略来优化隐蔽视觉感知任务。

Method: 通过数学优化将问题展开为多阶段深度网络，结合三种模块：CORE 模块（掩模域可逆建模），CARE 模块（RGB 域背景分离），以及 FINE 模块（基于扩散模型的细节优化）。

Result: 实验表明，RUN++ 的多阶段网络模型有效提升了对模糊区域的不确定性处理，提高了速度与性能，同时降低了错误检测率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 RUN++ 综合性强，特别适用于实际环境的 CVP 任务，展示了新的构建鲁棒 CVP 系统的可能性。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Conclusion: GasTwinFormer在多方面验证其高效性和精确性，是实时监测牲畜排放的实际解决方案。

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CurveFlow，通过引入曲率指导实现非线性轨迹的流匹配框架，在图文生成任务中优于现存方法，并显著提升语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性轨迹模型可能通过数据流形上低概率区域，导致图像生成质量受损，探讨轨迹曲率与生成图像间语义对齐的关系。

Method: 提出CurveFlow，通过曲率正则化方法引导平滑非线性轨迹，并在流动路径中引入曲率指导。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验显示，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成任务上表现优越，在BLEU、METEOR等语义一致性指标上超过现有方法如Rectified Diffusion。

Conclusion: 引入曲率建模显著提升复杂指令的语义一致性并保持高图像质量，表明新方法有效。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HiRQA的无参考图像质量评价方法，该方法无需主观标签，仅通过输入图像即可完成质量评分，并在泛化能力和实时性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决现有无参考图像质量评价方法对数据集偏倚和主观标签的依赖问题，以及提高其对真实场景的泛化性能。

Method: 通过自监督学习框架HiRQA，结合排序学习和对比学习，引入新的高阶排序损失和嵌入距离损失，并在训练时通过文本引导的对比对齐损失优化特征表示。

Result: HiRQA在合成与真实场景的图像失真上均实现了最先进的性能，展现了出色的泛化能力与伸缩性。其中轻量级版本HiRQA-S推理时间仅为3.5毫秒每张图像。

Conclusion: HiRQA在无需先验参考和主观标签的情况下显著提升了图像质量评价的性能，为合成与真实失真场景提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于提高多视角3D重建的可靠性，针对的是边缘环境中可能出现的系统中断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D重建在紧急响应、战术场景和公共安全中具有重要作用，但由于即时边缘环境的动态特性和操作挑战，经常会影响重建质量的可靠性。

Method: 提出一种基于投资组合理论的资源管理方法，使用遗传算法优化相机选择，以确保在空间时间相关中断情况下，重建质量的稳定性。

Result: 通过使用公开和定制3D数据集，验证了该策略在与传统基线方法的比较中能够更好地保证重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了即时边缘环境中的可靠性问题，能在存在中断的情况下维持较高的重建质量。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM框架在实现高精度疾病诊断的同时提供了可靠且可解释的诊断报告，为智能诊断与临床需求间搭建了桥梁，并获得了临床评估的认可。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

### [12] [MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)
*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,Rüdiger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MeSS模型，通过改进的图像扩散模型生成一致的3D场景，其质量和几何对齐性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前城市网格模型缺乏逼真的纹理，限制了在虚拟导航和自动驾驶中的应用。

Method: 提出了一个三阶段流程：首先使用控制网络生成稀疏一致视图；然后通过AGInpaint传播到更密集的中间视图；最后通过GCAlign模块消除全局视觉不一致性。同时，通过3D高斯点云场景重建技术，对网格表面进行初始化。

Result: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量上优于现有方法，并支持多风格渲染和转移。

Conclusion: MeSS通过结合几何一致性和风格一致性生成高质量的3D场景，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Conclusion: 这种方法可以作为一种工具，用于在强化学习训练中模拟更真实的环境和极端情况，从而提升整体的安全性。

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I管道增强了肾脏病理功能单元的形态量化能力，通过综合多个处理技术，其公开可用性有助于推动相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升通过行车记录仪视频预测道路交通事故的效果，且仅依赖视频输入更具成本效益和实用性。

Method: 设计了一种改进的时空特征提取及聚合方法，并通过递归网络结合，优化现有图神经网络用于事故预测。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，STAGNet模型平均精度和平均碰撞时间优于前人方法。

Conclusion: STAGNet模型在基于视频的事故预测上表现出优异性能，可以为先进驾驶辅助系统提供支持。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

### [16] [Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228)
*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM 是首个面向 3D 的多模态生成模型，能够结合 RGB、RGBD 和点云数据，通过三平面潜变量扩散模型生成高质量 3D 内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 3D 生成模型往往局限于单一模态，未能充分利用多模态数据的优势。而当前也存在依赖 3D 数据的模型，限制了训练数据来源。

Method: TriMM 引入了协作多模态编码，结合模态特定特征，并加入辅助的 2D 和 3D 监督，最终通过三平面潜变量扩散模型生成纹理和几何细节丰富的 3D 内容。

Result: 实验表明 TriMM 在小数据训练条件下能够达到与使用大规模数据训练的模型相媲美的表现；同时验证了使用其他多模态数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM 通过整合多模态信息，有效提升了 3D 内容生成的质量和灵活性，为多模态 3D 生成研究提供了新的途径。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向中心的原型对比聚类框架，通过软原型对比模块和双一致性学习模块解决类别间冲突问题并提高聚类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聚类方法在类别间冲突问题上存在挑战，原型对比方法因硬原型与真实聚类中心的偏差效果有限，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 框架由软原型对比模块和双一致性学习模块组成，前者根据样本属于聚类中心的概率计算类别原型，后者对齐样本不同变换及不同样本邻域，确保特征具有变换不变语义信息和紧凑的聚类分布。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验结果表明，新方法在聚类任务中的表现优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了类别间冲突问题，改善了聚类性能，为实现高精度聚类提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的任务Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN，利用两架不同高度的无人机联合完成视觉与语言导航任务，并提出了相关的数据集HaL-13k和框架AeroDuo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单一无人机视觉与语言导航任务受限于长路径和复杂机动性，难以可靠完成任务，而高机动性无人机理论上能提供多层次的视角。为避免学习过程中动作范围过大，提出结合高低空无人机的协同导航新设计。

Method: 提出一种新的大规模数据集HaL-13k，包含13838条高低空无人机协作的导航路径及其配套目标导向的语言指令。同时，设计了框架AeroDuo，高空无人机利用多模态大型语言模型Pilot-LLM进行目标推理，低空无人机采用轻量多阶段策略负责精确导航和目标定位。两者通过最小化的坐标信息交换进行高效协作。

Result: 实验数据集包括未见过的地图和目标验证集，用于系统性评估模型在新环境及目标上的泛化能力。通过AeroDuo框架，两台无人机协同有效融合，高空提供环境推理，低空完成精准导航，验证了框架的可行性与高效性。

Conclusion: Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN任务通过高低空无人机协作及创新框架设计，为解决复杂无人机导航问题提供了新的解决思路，同时促进了UAV-VLN领域的发展。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成过程中步骤过多、效率低的问题，并探讨原始扩散过程能否实现同样的效率。

Method: 提出跳步采样机制，不依赖非马尔可夫方法，通过跳过多个中间去噪步骤进行加速。同时结合DDIM以进一步提升生成效果。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多个预训练扩散模型上能以较少的采样步骤生成高质量结果。

Conclusion: 跳步采样是扩散模型的一种内在属性，可以在马尔可夫框架下实现高效且高质量的生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Method: 提出了一个多功能编码框架整合多种编码模式，通过增强型上下文学习方法训练大语言模型代理进行编码模式选择和决策，并引入专用基准测试IIC-bench用于评估交互式图像压缩。

Result: 实验显示Comp-X能够高效理解编码请求，具有优秀的文本交互能力，同时在单一框架下仍保持与现有技术相当的压缩性能。

Conclusion: Comp-X是一种创新的图像压缩方法，展示了人工通用智能（AGI）在图像压缩领域潜在的前景。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

Motivation: 现有方法在检测阶段的监督策略限制了车道拓扑推理的性能，导致拓扑监督范围有限。

Method: 提出了RATopo策略，通过重新设计Transformer解码器的结构，实现多种冗余车道预测和多样化的拓扑监督。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的实验结果表明，RATopo策略可以无缝整合到现有的拓扑推理框架中，并显著提升车道-车道及车道-交通要素的拓扑推理性能。

Conclusion: RATopo是一种模型无关的策略，可有效改善车道拓扑推理的表现，为自主驾驶领域提供了一种新的优化技术。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化CHD检测方法忽略时序信息，局限于二分类问题，并未考虑预测校准。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 该方法通过图像编码器提取视频帧特征，用训练的时序提取器捕捉心脏运动，与特定类别文本提示对齐，并通过引入一种新的不确定性量化模块来增强模型的临床可靠性。

Result: 在私人数据集检测CHD和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上均实现最先进效果，分别达到了85.40%和显著提高的分类准确率，同时显著减少了校准误差。

Conclusion: TPA方法证明了其在胎儿CHD分类中的有效性，结合了时序建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，达到了最新的研究水平。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Motivation: 解决伪装物体检测任务中由于物体与背景相似性高而导致的检测困难，同时减少对繁重训练和大计算资源的依赖。

Method: 提出了RAG-SEG框架分为两阶段：(1)检索增强生成（RAG），通过无监督聚类构建小型检索数据库以生成粗略掩码；(2)使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行进一步精细化分割。

Result: RAG-SEG在多个COD基准数据集上的性能表现与SOTA方法相当甚至更优，同时方法无需训练，可高效运行于个人笔记本计算机上。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG展示了伪装物体检测任务中在低计算资源和无训练条件下仍能实现较高性能的可行性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Result: 通过四项任务（对象删除、艺术风格删除、名人删除和显式内容删除）的实验验证，VideoEraser在多方面均优于现有方法，在抑制不良内容生成方面表现突出，平均降低46%。

Conclusion: VideoEraser作为一种即插即用的工具，不仅有效解决了T2V模型生成有害内容的问题，还在模型完整性和鲁棒性方面维持了较高水平，为该领域提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了Video-LLMs内部工作机制，利用注意力淘汰方法表明其在处理视频内容时存在两阶段过程，同时提供了提高计算效率的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当下大部分Video-LLMs研究专注于提升性能，而鲜有关注内部机制的研究。此论文旨在填补这一空白，系统性地解析Video-LLMs的内部工作方式。

Method: 采用注意力淘汰作为主要分析工具，设计了视频时间淘汰、视频空间淘汰和语言到视频淘汰三种变体，并通过全局和细粒度两种设置对不同层窗口进行实验分析。

Result: 研究得出三大关键发现：1) 在全局层面，视频信息的提取主要在早期层完成，形成两阶段过程；2) 在细粒度层面，某些中间层对视频问答影响较大，其余层的贡献有限；3) 空间时间建模更多依赖语言引导的检索，而非高计算成本的帧内和帧间自注意力机制。

Conclusion: 首次揭示了Video-LLMs处理和理解视频内容的内部机制，不仅提供了解释性视角，也为进一步提高模型效率提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习在图像分析上的进步显著，但大量完全训练的模型计算需求高，因此需要更高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 引入BioTune方法，利用进化算法选择模型中需微调的特定层，减少训练参数，提高迁移学习效率和性能。

Result: BioTune在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上表现优越，与现有微调方法（如AutoRGN和LoRA）相比，展示出具有竞争力的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BioTune通过专注于相关层的微调，减少训练参数数量，降低计算成本，为处理不同数据特征和分布的迁移学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种图像条件高斯点量化器(ICGS-Quantizer)方法，其大幅提升了3D场景压缩效率并适应长期存档后的场景变化，实验表明其在压缩效率及适应性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D高斯散粒技术在存储受限设备上的压缩方法仍存在中大型场景压缩效率不足和缺乏适应存档后场景变化的能力的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯点间及属性间的关联性，并使用固定的共享码本来提升量化效率，同时允许基于解码时捕获的图像条件进行场景解码以适应存档后场景变化。

Result: 实验表明，ICGS-Quantizer在3D场景压缩和场景更新性能上优于其他方法，显著减少3DGS所需存储空间（千字节级），同时保留了视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer解决了高质量3D场景存档和适应性问题，在压缩效率和长期灵活性方面表现出色，为高效3D场景存档提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决动态场景下现有3D重建方法中背景优化不足及几何表示不准确的问题。

Method: 采用动态静态解耦的神经Gaussian表示法，借助区域划分初始化方法处理行驶视点线性运动，结合可变形神经Gaussians及深度预训练模型监督，提升动态演员建模与几何结构精度。

Conclusion: DriveSplat方法在动态与静态解耦结合方面有创新提升，为行车场景中准确的3D重建和视图合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 新的改进方法有助于提高模型在抽象推理任务中的表现，推进了这一领域的发展。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 现有的视频摘要方法难以捕捉全局时间依赖性，并在多通道特征融合过程中容易被噪声影响。

Conclusion: SpiVG网络在提升信息质量、语义连贯性及对噪声的处理上显示了卓越性能，为短视频内容分析带来新方法。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: 尽管 MAEs 在视觉基础模型预训练中表现出色，但其在新数据集上的大量超参数调优成为了一项挑战，因此需要探索超参数如何影响下游性能。

Method: 通过理论推导线性 MAE 学到的特征，以及扩展到非线性 MAE 的特征分析，揭示其超参数（如掩码比例和 patch 大小）与输入图像空间相关性的关系，并提供超参数选择指导。

Result: 证明了掩码比例和 patch 大小会影响短期和长期空间相关性特征的捕获能力，MAE 表现能够适应数据集中的空间相关性，超越二阶统计信息层面。

Conclusion: MAEs 的超参数选择对于有效学习空间相关性至关重要，该研究为更好地应用 MAEs 提供了理论基础和实用建议。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: BIRD方法有效解决了现有学习方法的局限性，利用双向时序信息及联合优化提升了移动红外小目标检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: 提出的MATR模型显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，特别是在不同数据集上的应用表现优异。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,

### [41] [Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from extremely sparse views with SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15457)
*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于极端稀疏视角的3DGS方法，通过免SfM的方式解决视角稀疏带来的问题，大幅提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法依赖于密集多视角输入和精准相机位姿，但在现实情况下这些条件难以满足，特别是视角稀疏时SfM方法会失效，从而导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种免SfM的3DGS方法，引入密集立体模块以逐步估算相机位姿并初始化全局点云。同时采用视角插值模块生成一致的监督信号，并通过多尺度一致性正则化和自适应空间正则化提升几何结构与渲染内容质量。

Result: 在仅使用2个训练视角的情况下，实现了PSNR提升2.75dB的显著效果，并在图像质量和高频细节保留方面优于现有技术手段。

Conclusion: 新方法在极端稀疏视角条件下显著提升了3DGS渲染性能，为三维场景重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了LGMSNet，一个轻量级医疗图像分割框架，结合局部与全局多尺度机制，实现了高效性能和优越的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量化模型为了效率常牺牲性能，并缺乏全局上下文感知能力，同时未解决卷积核通道冗余问题，限制了特征提取的有效性。

Method: 采用异构的层内卷积核提取局部高频信息，并通过稀疏Transformer卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息，从而实现局部与全局多尺度特征结合的框架。

Result: 在6个公开数据集上展现了优越性能，特别是在4个未见数据集上的零样本泛化测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: LGMSNet兼具高性能与轻量化，在资源有限的临床场景中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升稀疏多视点RGB图像的3D人体重建质量，解决现有方法中几何和身体姿态估计不足的问题。

Method: 提出了联合多视图身体优化（JMBO）算法，结合SMPL-X模型进行多视点一致性优化，并通过法线地图集成细化细节，实现高保真表面重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，MExECON相较单视点基线方法在保真度上显著提高，表现达到与现代少样本3D重建方法的竞争水平。

Conclusion: MExECON有效利用多视点信息，不需重新训练网络，改善了3D重建的几何细节和性能，适用于稀疏多视点场景。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的任务泛化多模态图像融合框架AdaSFFuse，旨在解决现有方法中频率丢失和模态失配等问题，实验表明其性能优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态图像融合方法在模态错配、高频信息损失等方面存在一定的局限性，需要新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了AdaSFFuse框架，该框架包括自适应近似小波变换（AdaWAT）和空间-频率Mamba块两个核心模块，用于频率分离以及有效的多模态融合。

Result: AdaSFFuse在红外-可见光图像融合、多焦点图像融合、多曝光图像融合和医学图像融合四个任务中表现优异，在计算成本低的同时实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: 本文的AdaSFFuse框架通过改进的频率分离和跨领域融合方法，成功提升了多模态图像融合的鲁棒性和质量，并将在未来开放代码以供研究者使用。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成几何一致性和渲染保真方面表现不充分，亟需改进。

Method: 提出基于高斯-有符号距离函数的RSG表征以及用于处理远距离物体的FFG。此外，设计了基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，以选择性整合生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多摄像头设置和多种生成先验上，ExtraGS显著提升了扩展视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS展示了以几何和生成先验集成为基础的扩展视图合成在自动驾驶场景模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为GroupSketch的新方法，用于处理复杂、多物体交互的矢量草图动画，显著提升了现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多物体互动及复杂运动时表现不佳，存在时序不一致和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段通过语义分组及关键帧生成粗略动画；第二阶段利用组基位移网络（GDN）结合文本到视频模型的先验知识精炼动画，并通过上下文条件特征增强模块改善时序一致性。

Result: 广泛实验表明，GroupSketch方法在生成复杂多物体草图的高质量时序一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在拓展草图动画实际应用上的潜力得到了验证。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Motivation: 解决窄路宽度有限、拓扑分散以及遮挡频繁导致的遥感图像中道路提取挑战。

Method: 设计D3FNet，结合差分注意膨胀提取模块、双流解码融合机制及多尺度膨胀策略，从编码到解码实现特征精细提取和背景噪声抑制。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准上的窄道路区域IoU和召回率显著优于前沿模型，同时通过消融试验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: D3FNet为复杂遥感环境下的窄路提取提供了一种鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法依赖反向传播和迭代优化，难以实现实时部署；同时缺乏类条件特征分布建模，导致模型边界决策和预测不可靠。

Method: 将TTA重构为高斯概率推断任务，采用逐步更新的类均值和共享协方差矩阵进行推断，结合CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量化正则化。该方法无需源数据、无需梯度更新，并支持在线和转导式设置。

Conclusion: 提出的ADAPT方法有效解决了TTA中的实时性、扩展性和可靠性问题，丰富了分布意识测试时自适应领域。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络在图像的频谱偏差问题上表现不足，难以捕捉高频细节，而隐式神经表示又作为像素格式的替代方案需要克服这一难点。

Method: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，采用邻域感知的软掩码，在训练早期对局部变化较强的像素赋予更高权重，后续转向全图训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了重建质量，并可以和现有的INR方法互补。

Conclusion: 首次尝试在图像隐式神经表示中为像素分配频率感知的重要性，开辟了解决频谱偏置问题的新方向。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 现有方法在点云对齐的全局最优求解上效率较低，尤其在高异常值比例情况下难以处理。

Method: 设计了一种线性时间凸松弛技术以及Contractor方法，用于加速分支定界算法（BnB）的优化过程。

Result: 在给定旋转轴的情况下，对100点的3D点云对齐求解速度小于0.5秒，显著比现有SDP求解器（如STRIDE）快两个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提方法在仅解决旋转TLS问题时性能优异，同时为全局最优性提供了理论证明和实验验证。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视频语言模型在时间感知方面存在诸如时间戳的隐含表示和实体对齐不够精准等问题，限制了其的视频理解能力。

Method: 提出了三大创新设计：1）Diffusion Temporal Latent 编码器提升了边界敏感度和时间一致性；2）对象绑定表示强化了查询实体与视觉证据的对齐；3）混合的离散时间标记方案实现了显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA以及多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过设计更敏感的时间编码和更强的实体对齐方式，Grounded VideoDiT显著提升了视频理解的能力，尤其在精细化时间推理上表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Method: 作者提出一种弱监督方法：从非优化模型或算法的初始结果中通过人工操作提供质量分级标签，并以此训练评级模型，随后利用评级结果反馈对分割模型进行微调优化。

Result: 所提出方法使树实例的正确识别提高了34%，同时显著减少了非树实例预测的数量，但在复杂或稀疏森林环境中仍存在性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 弱监督策略成功优化了树实例分割模型，但复杂场景中仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: MapKD通过知识蒸馏技术，在不依赖复杂传感器和离线地图的情况下，实现了高效的实时高清地图构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过时的离线地图和昂贵的多模态传感器，造成推理时不必要的计算开销。因此，需开发一种更高效、低成本的方案。

Method: 提出了MapKD框架，利用教师-教练-学生(TCS)知识蒸馏模式及两种蒸馏策略（TGPD和MSRD）实现从多模态到单模态的知识传递。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型分别提升了+6.68 mIoU和+10.94 mAP，同时提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: MapKD证明了使用知识蒸馏技术提升单模态视觉模型性能的潜力，为实时高清地图构建提供了高效低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

TL;DR: CM2LoD3方法通过冲突地图与建模优先级分析，自动提取和重建LoD3建筑细节，提升城市规划、数字化建模等领域的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoD1和LoD2模型缺乏建筑立面细节的问题，为更高级城市分析提供所需的开窗、入口等元素细节。

Method: 提出基于冲突地图(CM)的分析，结合通过语义冲突地图生成器(SCMG)生成的语义标注，实现建筑元素的分割与建模融合。

Result: 通过实验验证CM2LoD3在建筑开口分割与重建中的有效性，将分段纹理和融合算法加入后达到61%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究推动了LoD3模型自动化重建的高效性与扩展性，为3D城市建模提供新思路和开源实现。

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为多维动态提示路由（MDPR）的框架，用于优化视觉语言模型（VLM）的微调策略，应对类不平衡问题并提升表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）微调往往在类不平衡场景下表现出偏差问题，且当前通过引入大语言模型（LLMs）弥补语义缺失的方法未充分考虑VLM预训练中内在的类不平衡问题。

Method: 提出基于五维视觉-语义知识库的MDPR框架，通过动态路由机制实现视觉类全局对齐、最优提示检索以及细粒度语义平衡，通过logits融合实现稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾数据集上的实验表明，MDPR方法达到了与当前SOTA方法相当的效果。同时，消融实验验证了语义库对尾部类的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPR能以较低的计算开销在数据不均衡情况下显著增强VLM微调，是一种灵活且高效的改进方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了StreamMem，一种用于长时间视频理解的无查询键值缓存内存机制，能够在内存受限的条件下高效进行视频问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大型语言模型在处理长视频方面存在内存与计算开销大的问题，而现有的视觉压缩方法对于长视频环境和多轮对话设定不适用，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出StreamMem，其通过一种流式的方式对新视频帧进行编码，利用视觉标记和通用查询标记之间的注意力分数来压缩键值缓存，同时保持固定大小的缓存以支持长视频的高效问答任务。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准和两个流媒体视频问答基准上，StreamMem在无查询键值缓存压缩方面达到了最新水准，同时在性能上能竞争基于查询优化的压缩方法。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮问答提供了一个有效的解决方案，在内存受限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 改善生成视频在长时间结构和动作一致性方面的表现，解决依赖RGB信号导致的误差累积问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，结合RGB帧和感知条件的联合建模，利用深度线索构建内存库，并采用分段噪声调度进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，WorldWeaver有效减少时间漂移，提升生成视频的清晰度和一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过改进感知和深度信息的使用及优化训练策略，显著提升了长时间视频的生成效果。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 目前通用视觉基础模型（如SAM）虽表现强大，但在细粒度语义分割（如特定核类型或细胞）的识别中存在局限性。该研究希望通过结合分子驱动的学习方法，克服这些限制以提升生物医学图像分析的精度和可用性。

Method: 提出了All-in-SAM模型，该全栈方法包括：1）利用分子驱动学习减少精细标注需求；2）通过SAM适配器在学习中增强语义特性；3）通过分子导向的纠正学习（MOCL）来进一步精细化分割精度。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Conclusion: Waver在视频生成领域取得了显著的进展，有望推动社区更高效地训练高质量的视频生成模型。

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

TL;DR: 现有的人体网格建模方法在捕捉多样化身体姿态和形状的细节时表现不足。本文提出ATLAS，将形状和骨架基独立建模，提供更高保真度的人体模型，在多种姿态下能更精确地拟合未知对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因训练数据多样性受限和模型假设限制，难以表达人体复杂细节，并且通常模型依赖外部表面优化再推测骨架结构，造成内部骨骼与外软组织的耦合问题。

Method: 利用包含240台同步相机采集的60万高分辨率扫描数据，学习高保真的ATLAS人体模型。核心方法是将网格表示与人体骨架相结合，明显去耦形状与骨架基，同时用非线性姿态校正增强模型表现。

Result: ATLAS超越现有方法，在未见过的多样姿态对象上能够更精准拟合，并在定量评估中表明其非线性姿态校正在表达复杂姿态上优于线性模型。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过去耦合并优化人体形状和骨架基，同时增强复杂姿态的表达能力，为人体建模提供更高的精确性和可控性。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Conclusion: VAREdit在提高编辑精度和效率方面展现了显著优势，同时提供了适合相关研究与开发的开源工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Conclusion: 该框架适用于文本到图像、图像生成、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务，使生成模型能够以组为单位处理输出，而非独立样本，并成功改善生成质量与多样性。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Motivation: 目前视觉扩散模型在高分辨率图像和视频生成上受到训练分辨率限制，现有方法在高分辨率生成时存在低质量和重复模式问题，需要突破难点以实现更高分辨率的生成效果。

Method: 提出CineScale推理范式，针对两种视频生成架构的问题，设计了专门的变体，并基于现有的开源视频生成框架，使其支持高分辨率图像和视频生成，包括从图像到视频（I2V）和从视频到视频（V2V）的生成。

Conclusion: CineScale验证了其在高分辨率视觉生成方面的优越性，突破了现有模型的局限，为未来的高分辨率影像生成指明了方向。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为参与者提供初步结果，帮助他们优化系统并提交报告。

Method: 基于自动评估方法对机器翻译系统的表现进行初步排名。

Result: 初步排名可能偏向使用重排序技术的系统，如质量评估重排序或最小贝叶斯风险解码。

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation

based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task

TL;DR: 此论文提出了一个框架，用于通过大语言模型实现文化本地化数学文字题数据集的自动生成，以解决多语言数学推理数据集中英语中心化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多语言、低资源语言环境中数学推理数据集匮乏，尤其是缺乏包含本地文化实体（如名字、组织、货币）的数据集的问题。

Method: 设计并提出一个基于大语言模型的框架，从现有数据集中自动构建包含本土化名字、组织和货币的数学文字题数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅有助于更好地评估数学推理能力，尤其是在社会文化背景下的能力，还能够改进多语言模型的公平性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何使用少量易于生产的数据资源提升一般指令调优大语言模型在机器翻译任务中的能力。

Method: 选用斯洛文语为案例，使用Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）方法，通过程序化方法创建高质量的训练数据集并用此优化模型。

Result: 优化后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时的COMET分数较基线模型分别提升了约0.04和0.02，并减少了语言和格式错误。

Conclusion: 使用DPO与针对性数据优化的大语言模型在机器翻译中能显著超越基线模型的表现，同时更加稳定和准确。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Result: 新数据集和解析方法显著提升了多语言解析性能，尤其是在低资源语言和用户自定义输入场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文为多语言对话解释系统研究提供了重要的数据集和方法支持，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Method: 通过奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）算法，利用对人类偏好对齐的小草稿模型，加速大模型的推断，同时保持目标模型的不变性。

Result: 在弱到强对齐实验中，SSS 算法实现了更高的奖励得分，并显著降低了推断成本。

Conclusion: SSS算法有效解决了测试时对齐的效率瓶颈，展示了理论与实践上的优越性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的召回指标因依赖词汇重叠而易出错，或因缺乏结构化验证而偏向误差，导致无法充分捕捉完整信息，尤其在医疗、法律等领域。

Method: 提出三阶段召回评估框架，通过答案分解、词汇与语义过滤，以及结构化证实检查多方面过滤并验证答案。

Result: 在三个困难的长形式问答基准上评估，通过人工注释和LLM评估，表现出显著优于现有基线的召回准确性提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall框架能减少误报和漏报，适应多样化表述和上下文变化，为系统性召回评估奠定基础。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: 提出通过将LLM与符号推理结合，解决LLM在结构化预测中的局限性。实验表明，这种结合提升了预测的一致性和准确性，校准和微调进一步改善了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在无需任务特定微调的情况下表现出色，但因自回归特性在复杂推理和一致性上存在不足。本文旨在结合符号推理克服这些问题。

Method: 通过将LLM与组合推理结合，并探索有效的提示策略以估计LLM的置信度，同时检验校准和以结构化预测为目标的微调方法。

Result: 与单独使用提示相比，加入符号推理后，LLM预测的一致性和准确性显著提高。此外，校准和基于结构化预测目标的微调进一步提升了表现。

Conclusion: 结构化学习在LLM时代仍然具有重要价值，将LLM与符号推理相结合是提升性能的有效手段。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Method: 提出一种新的领域无关的科学文本提取管道，通过lynx的布局感知渲染和目标化的LLM清理阶段，从多种格式如MathJax、KaTeX中恢复数学结构，并标准化为LaTeX表示法。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+两个高质量数学语料库，4+版本的标记数比之前的最佳质量数据集FineMath-4+多5.5倍。用其预训练的模型在数学、编程任务和通用领域表现上超越了强基线。

Conclusion: 首次实现从低质量的网页规模数据中可靠地提取科学内容，并且显著提升了在数学、代码和通用推理领域的性能，开创了公开数学预训练语料的新高度，同时发布了代码和数据集支持开源事业。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型常因为“幻觉”生成误导性答案，作者旨在解决当询问中存在错误假设时如何给出正确答案的问题。

Method: 通过引入外部证据和验证细化假设分解的方式，减少模型生成的虚假内容并提高解释性。

Result: 在五个大型语言模型上的实验表明，结合检索证据和生成验证假设，回答准确性和解释性都有提升。

Conclusion: 这种方法有助于模型回答包含错误假设的问题，并改进输出解释性，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Motivation: 当前LLM和LVLM在复杂多回合、需要深度推理的视觉语义任务中存在局限性，包括上下文丢失、视觉误判等问题。

Method: 提出MMDR-Bench数据集，包含300个复杂对话场景，及一个不需重新训练的CoLVLM Agent框架，通过“记忆-感知-计划-执行”循环提升模型能力。

Result: 在MMDR-Bench测试集上，CoLVLM Agent的平均人类评分达到4.03，高于GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro等领先商业模型。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent通过模块化和迭代方法显著提升了深度推理、指令遵循及长对话表现，为复杂多模态交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义感知的分词方法SemToken，通过结合语境语义信息和局部聚类降低分词冗余，同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词方法如BPE或WordPiece仅基于频率统计，无法充分利用文本语义结构，导致冗余分词和上下文利用不足，尤其是在长上下文场景中。

Method: SemToken通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，并进行局部语义聚类来合并语义等价的词元。同时，依据语义密度分配异构词元粒度，在语义丰富区域采用较细粒度分词，重复或低信息区使用粗粒度压缩。

Result: 在WikiText-103与LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准上，SemToken减少了最多2.4倍的词元数量，实现了1.9倍速度提升，且困惑度与下游任务表现无明显下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为大语言模型的分词优化与计算效率提升提供了新的可能性方向。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）在金融等特定领域中表现不足，主要因为金融领域的推理高度结构化且对事实与法规正确性要求更高。

Method: 提出了一种名为Fin-PRM的模型，它结合了步骤级别和轨迹级别的奖励监督，支持对金融推理步骤的精细化评估，并在监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理等方面提供支持。

Result: 实验显示，基于Fin-PRM的模型在金融推理任务中优于通用PRMs和领域特定基线，训练结果显示监督学习提升12.9%、强化学习提升5.2%、测试时推理性能提升5.1%。

Conclusion: Fin-PRM展示了领域专用奖励建模在对齐语言模型与专家级金融推理方面的重要性，显著提高了模型在金融推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SPARK的方法，通过在通道层面修剪KV缓存以减少冗余，同时动态恢复修剪条目，从而在相同的内存预算下处理更长的序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩KV缓存时忽略了跨特征维度的重要性变化，从而限制了模型效率与准确性的平衡。

Method: 提出不依赖训练的即插即用方法SPARK，通过在通道层面进行非结构化稀疏修剪KV，结合动态恢复操作，实现对冗余的有效减少。

Result: SPARK在相同的内存预算下表现更优，与现有方法相比存储需求降低超过30%，即使修剪比例达到80%，性能下降也不超过5%。

Conclusion: SPARK方法不仅提升了长序列处理能力，还兼具高效性与准确性，适用于和现有KV压缩与量化技术的集成。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

Result: 在医疗、法律与金融领域的问答基准测试中，S2K表现优于现有方法，并以显著较低的成本达到了与领域预训练LLMs匹配的效果。

Conclusion: 使用S2K框架可以以降低成本的方式实现领域知识的内化，并提升特定领域问答能力，为领域问答提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了SEER方法，通过不断更新的经验池进行逐步检索，优化LLM在多步工具使用中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工设计的任务演示或从预设库中检索，效率低且扩展性差，亟需一种可持续改进的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为SEER的自引导方法，通过动态经验池记录与增量检索，优化工具链规划和参数生成。

Result: 在ToolQA基准上，对简单问题提升6.1%，对复杂问题提升4.7%；在真实世界测试集τ-bench上，提升分别达7.44%和23.38%。

Conclusion: SEER方法通过自动化和持续学习，显著提升了LLM在多步骤工具调用任务中的性能，展现了其优越性与可扩展性。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 使用生成式语言模型进行任务的自动化评估面临标准不明确的问题。该研究探讨了清单生成的方法及其有效性，发现选择性使用清单对评估效果有所提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对生成任务的评估标准模糊，该研究旨在探索清单生成的价值及其对评估准确性的影响。

Method: 研究使用六种方法生成清单，测试清单在八种模型规模下的有效性，并分析其与人工评估相关联的清单项。

Result: 实验表明，在成对比较任务中选择性使用清单能提升效果，但在直接评分任务中的表现不稳定。同时，即使与人类分数相关性较低的清单项，也能够反映人类编写的标准。

Conclusion: 研究建议需更加明确客观的评估标准，以更好地指导人工和自动评估过程。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了VocabTailor，一种新的去耦动态词汇选择框架，有助于极大减少小语言模型在资源受限环境中的内存使用，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在资源受限环境下有优势，但词汇相关组件的内存占用因大词汇表而庞大。现有静态词汇剪枝方法刚性化，信息损失严重，缺乏灵活性，亟需改进。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和工作不对称性观察，提出VocabTailor框架，通过嵌入卸载降低内存占用，并采用静态-动态混合策略实现按需载入词汇组件。

Result: 通过多样化下游任务实验，VocabTailor在词汇相关组件的内存使用上减少了99%，同时任务性能基本无损，远超现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor框架在内存使用和任务性能平衡上展现了极强的优势，适合边缘设备部署小语言模型。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在低资源语言如泰语中的表现较差，且现有基准缺乏文化与领域特定的细微差别，无法满足真实应用需求。

Method: 构建了WangchanThaiInstruct泰语数据集，涵盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过多阶段质量控制创建，并进行零样本评估和指令微调实验。

Result: 基于WangchanThaiInstruct微调的模型，在域内和域外基准任务中均优于使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 具有文化和专业背景的指令数据是提高低资源、语言多样化环境下大语言模型对齐能力的关键。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话中普遍存在的代码转换对多语言语音技术提出了挑战，而现有研究因为数据集稀缺而受限。

Method: 使用SWORDS算法，通过替换句中特定单词为其翻译并考虑词性，生成代码转换样本。基于此，构建多语言CS语料库CS-FLEURS。

Result: 实验结果表明，CS-FLEURS在客观和主观评估指标上都与现有数据集表现相当，并具有高可理解性和自然度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有望促进代码转换语音技术的发展，并推动更包容的多语言系统的实现。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型缺乏针对模拟职业角色的全面心理与伦理评价，因此提出了一个新的框架用于评估这些模型的心理及伦理特性。

Method: 提出了EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建了88个教师特定的道德困境，并通过软提示注入评估教师类模型的顺从性及脆弱性，通过实验测试不同模型的心理及伦理表现。

Result: 实验表明，教师角色的模型表现出比人类教师更理想化和两极化的性格，在抽象道德推理方面表现优秀，但在情感复杂的问题中存在困难。推理能力较强的模型对有害提示注入更为脆弱。温度等超参数对风险行为的影响有限。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供了用于评估教育AI中教师角色模型伦理和心理对齐性的基准，并指出了能力和安全性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统无法解决当检索上下文与语言模型内部知识矛盾时的准确性问题。

Method: CARE包含一个上下文评估器和一个基础语言模型，通过软提示对上下文可靠性进行训练区分，并引导推理方向。

Result: 在多个QA和事实核查基准上提升了5.0%的性能表现。

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信、适应性强的RAG系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表明，先进的LLMs在处理涉及时间常识推理的任务时表现较弱，因此需要一个方法来自动挖掘和利用时间常识以改善模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种时间常识提取管道，利用LLMs自动挖掘时间常识，并以此构建了TComQA数据集，该数据集由SAMSum和RealNews语料库生成，并经过众包验证确保精度超过80%。

Result: 使用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务中表现优于在已有时间问答数据集上微调的LLM。

Conclusion: 基于TComQA的数据集，证明了使用先进的时间常识提取方法能够增强LLMs在时间推理任务中的表现，这为时间信息建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE模型通过分析120毫秒的固定窗口来捕捉音素特征，具有较少参数且在跨语言任务中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音任务需要与语言上下文无关的纯音素表征，这推动了CUPE的开发。

Method: CUPE利用固定宽度的独立短窗口，学习跨语言共性的声学模式，同时保持模型轻量级。

Result: 实验在包括零次测试的多语言任务中显示出CUPE的强跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 有效的普适语音处理可通过在音素长度窗口内建模基本声学模式实现。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGC模型在多个数据集和评估指标上的性能难以直接比较，缺乏统一的评价框架。

Method: 提出新的元指标EDAS，该指标通过综合多个数据集和多种评估标准的表现，将模型性能归一化至一个范围值（0到1），以实现全局分析和比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，EDAS能够有效整合多个评估指标与数据集的性能表现，提供统一的排名框架。

Conclusion: EDAS以其统一性、鲁棒性和普适性，为KGC模型的比较分析和选择提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法受限于静态生成长度和僵化的验证标准，无法适应不同的不确定性和输入复杂性。

Method: 引入基于信息熵和边际不确定性度量的框架，动态调整每次迭代生成的tokens数量，并利用同样的不确定性信号改进验证过程，增强自适应性和灵活性。

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要生成任务中证明相比标准推测解码方法具有显著加速效果，同时BLEU和ROUGE得分保持或提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种针对大模型不确定性情况下高效且鲁棒的解码机制，能在多种条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视大型语言模型中词汇表规模扩大的益处，探索其根本来源。

Method: 通过控制变量实验，将语言模型的词汇表规模从24K扩展到196K，同时保持数据、计算和优化的固定。采用Kolmogorov复杂性量化文本复杂性，并分解词级损失以分析影响。

Result: 发现更大的词汇表主要降低了文本中最频繁出现的2500个词的不确定性，尽管对稀有词的损失有所增加。实验还证明模型利用了令牌频率失衡这一特性，而非因其受损。

Conclusion: 结果重新定义了更大词汇表可以提升表现的观点，归因于降低被标记文本复杂性。同时提出了词表与模型协调设计的新的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出MCR-BENCH基准，用于评估大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在面对音频与文本信息冲突时的优先级处理能力，研究发现这些模型严重偏向文本输入，忽视音频证据，导致性能下降及可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型音频语言模型在多模态输入中，面对音频和文本信息冲突时的表现和可靠性问题。

Method: 提出了MCR-BENCH基准，通过多种音频理解任务，对LALMs在冲突输入情境下的信息优先级处理能力进行全面评估，研究影响文本偏向的因素，并尝试通过监督微调和模型信心分析来探索解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，LALMs在音频与文本冲突时，对文本输入存在显著偏向，导致音频相关任务性能下降，同时模型对冲突输入仍表现出过度自信。

Conclusion: 当前LALMs在多模态冲突处理上存在缺陷，需要改进模态平衡训练和设计更加复杂的融合机制以提升模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaSO是一种针对情感化观测活动 (LSLMs) 开发的开源、端到端框架，提供数据、训练指标及模型实现以弥补现有领域透明度不足和架构碎片化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语音语言模型（LSLM）研究由于模型架构分散及透明度不足，研究难以复现，也无法系统性评估和比较，同时模型通常只发布权重而无训练数据及运行配置，极大限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出了LLaSO框架，包含三个核心资源：LLaSO-Align（语音文本对齐语料库）、LLaSO-Instruct（多任务指令调优数据集）和LLaSO-Eval（标准化评估基准），并验证了其性能与广泛性。

Result: 培训并发布了基于LLaSO的模型LLaSO-Base，达到0.72的归一化评分，性能超越可对比模型。同时分析发现，尽管更广泛的训练覆盖增强了性能，但针对未见任务尤其是纯音频场景仍存在重大泛化问题。

Conclusion: LLaSO通过提供全套公开数据、基准和模型，为LSLM领域奠定了统一的开放标准，加速了社区驱动的研究进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Result: 成功翻译了25个非对等词汇至目标语言，并总结了翻译的方法和规则。

Conclusion: 提出了针对非对等词汇的翻译方法并验证其有效性，为翻译工作提供了可参考的路径。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 解决面向任务的对话代理对话状态跟踪的准确性问题，使得语言模型能够更好地遵循API模式并高效修正错误。

Method: 使用语言模型生成可执行代码跟踪对话状态，并通过一个简单的约束解码方法替代传统的语法规则，结合政策和执行反馈进行错误修正。

Result: 在SGD基准测试中取得了最新的对话状态跟踪性能，且在对话进行中对用户目标的估计表现优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: PyTOD通过结合语言模型和约束解码方法增强了对话状态跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，证明了基于执行感知状态跟踪的有效性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为RadReason的辐射报告评估框架，通过细粒度评分和可解释的理由实现更精确的自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统辐射报告评估中缺乏临床基础、解释性和细粒度指标的问题，开发一种更有效的评价体系。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的技术，提出了两大创新：(1) 子评分动态加权，用以自适应优先较具临床挑战的错误类型；(2) 多数引导的优势缩放，通过评分一致性调整策略梯度更新以优化性能。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有的离线指标，并达到了与GPT-4评估相当的水平，同时具有可解释性、成本效益性和临床可用性。

Conclusion: RadReason有效提高了辐射报告评估的准确性和实用性，可以为临床工作流提供支持，其代码将在公开发布后可用。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为SLM4Offer的生成式AI模型，用于通过生成个性化优惠提高客户参与度并推动业务增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销是提高客户满意度和转化率的重要策略，但现有方案的效果仍有提升空间。因此，研究团队旨在开发一种更智能的数据驱动方法以改进优惠生成。

Method: 论文提出了SLM4Offer模型，基于Google T5预训练语言模型进行微调，并利用对比学习中的InfoNCE损失函数，通过调整潜在空间来实现更准确的个性化匹配。训练和评估基于合成数据集。

Result: SLM4Offer的优惠接受率相比传统监督微调模型提高了17%，证明了采用对比学习目标的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过创新方法，SLM4Offer显著增强了个性化营销的能力，表明对比学习可以优化基于AI的优惠生成过程，实现更高的商业价值。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了一种针对主观行为的集群化语言模型训练方法HeTLM，证明了较小的语言模型在页面级数据上的表现可以优于大型语言模型，并且个性化集群训练能更好地捕捉用户的行为多样性与偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型强调多任务应用和广泛兼容性，但对于用户主观、异质化行为（如浏览行为）是否同样适用存疑。研究希望探索小型语言模型在这种场景下的表现，并评估单一模型是否能同时满足多样化的用户需求以及个性化表现。

Method: 提出了一种名为HeTLM（Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model）的集群化训练方法，基于用户行为的异质性为其设计不同的参数集，并通过页面级tokenizer提升数据处理的精细度。

Result: （i）小型语言模型在页面级tokenizer支持下优于大型模型；（ii）基于用户异质性的HeTLM在性能上超过单一的语言模型，且参数总量控制在同等水平；（iii）平均性能更高，生成质量具有更低的方差，从而更好地对齐用户需求。

Conclusion: 通过HeTLM的设计与验证，表明小型语言模型能够更有效地捕获用户主观行为与偏好。例如，通过为不同的用户群体定制参数集，既能提高性能均值，也能减少变异，实现更好的用户层面对齐。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 研究引入基于训练数据影响的课程学习，提升语言模型预训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人类定义难度的课程学习在预训练语言模型中效果有限，因此尝试更好地理解如何定义训练实例的难度以改进课程学习。

Method: 通过训练数据影响评分，重新定义训练实例的难度，并采用这种模型中心的评分标准排序训练数据进行课程学习。

Result: 采用这种基于训练数据影响的课程学习比随机训练顺序在基准测试中提升了超过10个百分点的表现。

Conclusion: 课程学习对于语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要基于模型中心的难度定义才能充分发挥其作用。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Result: 揭示不同SLM在准确性和能源效率上的权衡差异，为后续研究和应用提供了重要数据支持。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，有助于推动SLM在有效性与资源效率间的实践应用。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: 引入HebID，一个新的希伯来语多标签语料库，用于社会身份检测，并展示其在政治语言分析中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的身份检测数据集主要集中在英语，单标签以及粗略身份类别，缺乏对特定文化语境或语言表达独特性的考虑。

Method: 开发了HebID语料库，包括以色列政治家的Facebook帖子内容，手动标注了细化的12种社会身份类别，并采用多种模型进行基准测试。

Result: 希伯来语调优的大规模语言模型表现最佳，宏平均$F_1$得分达到0.74，同时在多种维度上分析了数据，包括流行度、时间趋势和性别相关的身份表达。

Conclusion: HebID提供了一个研究希伯来语语境下社会身份的综合基础，并为在其他非英语政治语境中开展类似研究提供了范例。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training

1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafetyFlow 系统通过七个特定代理，首次实现了全自动化大型语言模型（LLMs）安全基准测试的构建，仅需四天时间生成23,446条低冗余的测试数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全基准需大量人工参与，耗时耗资，且存在过度冗余和不足难度的问题，急需有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出SafetyFlow系统，整合了七个专门化代理，能够在无人工干预的情况下构建安全基准，并提供灵活的流程和成本控制能力。

Result: 生成了安全基准数据集SafetyFlowBench，包含23,446个高质量问询，并对49种先进LLM进行了安全性评估，实验验证了系统的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: 研发了首个完全自动化的安全基准测试系统，为LLM安全性研究提供了工具化和全面化的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these
creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep
cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing
outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SDGO，一种通过利用模型自身的辨别能力作为奖励信号来提高生成安全性的强化学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在作为辨别器方面比作为生成器更能有效识别有害请求，因此需要将辨别与生成能力对齐以提高安全性。

Method: 提出SDGO框架，该框架利用模型自我辨别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我优化提高生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。

Result: SDGO显著提升了模型的安全性，对抗分布外的jailbreaking攻击表现出强大的鲁棒性，同时保持在通用基准任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过对齐模型的辨别和生成能力，SDGO有效提高了模型的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SurGE，一种用于评估计算机科学领域科学综述生成的新基准，并提供自动化评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术文献的快速增长，人工撰写科学综述变得不可行，而目前缺乏标准化基准和评估协议限制了自动化进展。

Method: 引入SurGE基准，包括测试实例（主题描述、专家撰写的综述及参考文献）和一百万篇论文的检索池，并设计自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖、引用准确性、结构组织及内容质量四方面评价生成的综述。

Result: 评估结果表明，即使先进的自反性框架也难以高效生成综述，反映出任务的复杂性及研究继续的必要性。

Conclusion: SurGE的提出填补了标准化基准的空白，其开源资源能促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Pos2Distill的新框架，通过知识蒸馏减轻位置偏差，提高了长文本检索与推理任务的性能与一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以彻底解决由位置偏差引起的长情境理解与处理问题。

Method: 提出了Pos2Distill框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移至不利位置，设计了适用于检索和推理的两种细化版本：Pos2Distill-R1与Pos2Distill-R2。

Result: 通过使用Pos2Distill，在所有位置上实现了一致性增强和显著性能提升，并展现了在跨任务中的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill有效降低位置偏差，优化长情境检索与推理任务表现，同时具备良好的跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

TL;DR: 探讨Bangla语言的词干提取现状，指出研究与资源缺乏的挑战，提出开发更强大的词干提取器的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源有限和缺乏标注数据集，Bangla这种世界上第七大使用人数最多的语言在数字世界中代表性不足，因此需要改进其语言分析和处理能力。

Method: 对现有的词干提取方法进行全面综述，评估Bangla语言处理在形态复杂性和方言多样性下的挑战，分析已有研究的不足之处，同时提出改进建议。

Result: 发现Bangla词干提取领域的文献存在较大空白，易复现的实现稀缺，评价方法需要改进，并建议制定更加有效的Bangla词干提取解决方案。

Conclusion: 强调开发强健的Bangla词干提取工具以及持续推动该领域研究的重要性，为Bangla语言分析和处理提供高效且适用的技术支持。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商平台中的图片在提高产品理解方面可能不一致，但现有数据集规模和设计有限，无法系统性研究多图片的影响。

Method: 引入大规模多模态、多任务数据集EcomMMMU并提出SUMEI方法，通过预测图像效用来优化多图片在下游任务中的使用。

Result: 实验表明EcomMMMU揭示图片在多模态任务中的双刃剑效应，而SUMEI有效减少图片对任务性能的负面影响并提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态大语言模型在电商任务中的图片利用提供了新视角，并通过SUMEI方法显著改善了任务表现。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Deep-DxSearch的增强检索生成（RAG）系统，用于改善医学大语言模型诊断中知识空白和幻觉的问题，通过强化学习实现可控的检索增强推理，并在多项实验中验证其有效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学大语言模型在诊断中存在知识空白和幻觉，其利用外部知识的方式较弱且反馈推理的可追溯性较差，极大限制了诊断能力的提高。

Method: 提出Deep-DxSearch系统，构建大规模医学检索语料库，包括病历数据和可靠医学知识。将大语言模型（LLM）作为核心代理，以检索语料库为环境，通过强化学习和特殊奖励（包括格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性）训练出可控的检索增强推理策略。

Result: 实验表明，Deep-DxSearch超越了GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1等强大诊断基线，在多中心数据、常见疾病和罕见疾病的诊断中表现优异。消融研究证实了奖励设计和检索语料库的关键作用，案例研究和解释性分析展示了性能改进。

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch通过强化学习实现了可控、可追溯的检索增强推理框架，为提供可靠精准的医学诊断奠定了基础，并为临床医生决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 探索TIR是否能够普适性地提高LLM在不同任务中的推理能力，并评估其是否帮助模型优化推理行为。

Method: 引入ReasonZoo基准，涵盖9个不同的推理类别，同时提出PAC和AUC-PCC两种新评估指标，用于衡量推理效率和性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，启用了TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务上均优于对照组，并改善了推理效率，减少了过度推理行为。

Conclusion: TIR方法在多个领域具有广泛适用性，可显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的能力，推动了这一领域的进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型仅将光谱图方法作为辅助工具，缺乏一种在谱域内全面展开推理流程的理论框架。

Method: 逻辑实体和关系被编码为图信号，通过可学习的光谱滤波器处理，实现多尺度信息传播，最后映射为符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。提出了数学框架包括图傅里叶变换、带限注意力和光谱规则着陆。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge）上实验，展示了较现有神经符号模型的逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率改进。

Conclusion: GSP方法为构建健壮且可解释推理系统提供了数学支持和计算高效的基础。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

Motivation: 探索自然与人工智能的目标性行为形成机制，质疑传统强化学习模型中状态表示和奖励函数的独立假设，提出两者从与环境互动中共同涌现的可能性。

Method: 引入基于佛教认识论的目标状态概念，定义为目标等效的经验分布类别，从统计上用行为策略与目标体验特征的偏差衡量目标导向学习。

Result: 该理论框架能够解析目标导向行为的行为、现象和神经维度，为不同系统的目的性行为提供统一的解释。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的目标导向状态表征计算框架，有望扩展对行为与学习机制的理解。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Collab-REC的多代理框架，通过整合多种角度改善旅游推荐的多样性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决旅游推荐中因流行度偏差导致的低多样性问题，为用户提供更加全面的选择，特别关注过度旅游和环境可持续性问题。

Method: 框架包含三种基于LLM的代理（个性化、流行度和可持续性），通过非LLM的协调者进行多轮协商，综合各代理的推荐并避免重复或虚假的结果。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，Collab-REC较单代理基线模型显著提升多样性和整体相关性，同时推荐了较少被关注的地点。

Conclusion: 此框架证明了多方协作在LLM推荐系统中的潜力，能够提供更加平衡、上下文感知的旅游推荐，并更好地符合用户约束。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

Conclusion: 框架显著提高了群体动画的逼真度，使群体行为与环境的互动更加自然并具有现实感。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [125] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，增强推理能力和推理预算并不能改善大型语言模型在回答问题时的信心校准，而利用搜索增强生成的方式能显著提高校准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在回答问题时的信心校准问题，尤其是在处理知识密集型任务时的表现。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集进行实验，并扩展到人类与地球健康领域，评估推理能力与推理预算对信心校准的影响，同时测试搜索增强生成方法。

Result: 增强推理预算导致了模型的过度自信，而搜索增强生成的方式显著提高了校准精度，达到89.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 信息访问能力可能比推理深度或推理预算更为关键，是改进知识密集型任务信心校准的瓶颈因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出S3LoRA框架，通过仅检查LoRA微调的权重更新来减少潜在的安全风险，同时保持或提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM微调方法可能导致安全对齐问题，尤其是在代理规划任务中，这是由于现有安全意识适配方法对基础模型和指令调谐模型的依赖限制了其实际应用的可能性。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架，包括MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性并保持全局幅度信息，以及用于检测具有浓缩和潜在不安全更新的层的SSI指标，最终对这些层进行后处理剪枝以降低风险。

Result: 大量实验显示，S3LoRA能在提高安全指标的同时，维持或改善任务性能，显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在实际中安全部署LLM提供了一种轻量化、可扩展且实用的方案，尤其适用于资源受限和安全至关重要的环境。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够有效从人类交互中推断语言形式的目标，提供更丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大量离线数据。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家提供了开放的生态系统，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表与传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl在GUI代理领域取得了重大进展，通过多方面创新和改进的Mobile-Agent-v3框架，为多环境中的自动化表现设立了新标准。

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出了PuzzleClone框架，通过SMT生成大量可验证的数据集，用于增强大语言模型的推理能力，实验显示此方法显著提升了模型在逻辑和数学基准测试上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数据集在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性方面存在不足，需要一种能够生成高质量、可验证答案的数据集的方法以提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: 提出了PuzzleClone框架，包括将种子谜题编码为逻辑规范、通过变量与约束随机化生成多样化数据以及通过再现机制确保数据有效性，并构建了包含超8.3万经验证的谜题数据集。

Result: 模型在PuzzleClone测试集上的平均分从14.4提高到56.2，在其他7个逻辑和数学基准测试中表现也有显著提升（最高12.5个百分点）。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够可靠、高效地生成规模化、验证良好的数据集，显著增强大语言模型的逻辑和数学推理能力。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外科手术部位感染（SSI）是常见且费用高昂的医疗相关感染，而现有的伤口护理面临数据隐私和专家标注成本问题，同时缺乏公开的数据集和工具。

Method: 利用SurgWound数据集，提出涵盖视觉问答(VQA)和报告生成任务的诊断基准，以及一个三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，其中包括对伤口特性的多LLMs预测、基于知识输入的诊断、以及综合报告生成。

Result: 所提出的框架能够分析外科伤口特性，进而生成个性化伤口护理建议和干预措施。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了开放式外科伤口诊断工具的空白，为个性化伤口护理和患者结果改善提供了可能。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为LLM4Sweat的开源框架，以解决大语言模型（LLMs）在支持罕见疾病如多汗症领域的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多汗症是一种罕见但严重影响身体舒适度和心理健康的疾病，目前缺乏针对性治疗或诊断的方法。此外，LLMs在罕见疾病中的应用受到数据稀缺的限制。

Method: 提出了LLM4Sweat框架，分三阶段进行：（1）数据增强阶段，通过前沿LLM生成医学合理的合成数据集，（2）微调阶段，在基础模型上进行针对性微调，（3）推断与专家评估阶段，确保模型的准确性、适用性和共情能力进行评估与优化。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4Sweat在诊断与支持多汗症方面的表现优于基线模型，同时也示范了一种可以泛化到其他罕见疾病的解决思路。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat为罕见疾病提供了可信赖的诊疗支持，其开源和扩展性为未来领域研究提供参考。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个名为R-ConstraintBench的框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在资源受限项目调度问题（RCPSP）下的表现，发现LLM在复杂约束交互下表现不佳，并存在领域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估大型语言模型在高约束环境下的可靠性，特别是在NP完全问题类别中的资源受限项目调度问题（RCPSP）。

Method: 提出了R-ConstraintBench框架，通过对有向无环图（DAG）逐步增加先序约束，添加停机时间、时间窗和排他性约束来评估模型的能力。以数据中心迁移为例进行实证评估，并对多种LLM的可行性和错误进行了分析。

Result: LLM在仅含先序约束的DAG上表现接近满分，但当涉及更多复杂约束（如停机时间、时间窗、排他性约束）时，其可行性表现急剧下降，暴露了约束交互而非图深度为主要瓶颈。同时，模型在合成数据上的表现也无法保证在实际领域情境中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 指出现有LLM在复杂约束交互中的显著性能下降，需要进一步提高其在资源受限和实际场景下的推理能力。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Conclusion: 提出的优化工具为城市规划者和平衡竞争目标提供了重要的依据，支持快速城市化地区的更有效发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，名为Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory （\Ours{}），能通过粗到细的记忆增强LLM进行复杂规划任务的适应性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单一粒度的记忆机制，受经验质量的限制，导致知识多样性和规划灵活性不足。

Method: \Ours{}框架通过在任务环境中收集粗粒度信息指导经验收集，并从经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示，最终通过LLM在推理中检索相关经验和提示以支持规划。

Result: 当环境发生异常时，通过细粒度信息的自我问答与反思，能够灵活调整计划，实现对多样化场景的适应。

Conclusion: \Ours{}框架显著提升了LLM的知识多样性和规划灵活性，实现了复杂任务环境下的高效规划。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种离线强化学习的方法，通过结合人类偏好和专家示范数据，提高了信任分配和政策学习的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线强化学习通常依赖复杂的奖励函数设计，而人类反馈中的专家示范和偏好收集各有不足。亟需一种方法能够结合两者的优势以提高学习效果。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于搜索的偏好加权（SPW）机制，通过搜索专家示范中与偏好轨迹相似的状态-动作对，根据相似性分数导出重要性权重，并利用这些权重引导偏好学习。

Result: 实验结果显示，SPW能够有效结合偏好和专家示范数据，在机器人操作任务中性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPW方法解决了偏好学习中信用分配的问题，实现了从人类反馈的联合学习，具有提升离线强化学习效果的潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 作者提出大语言模型在实际旅行规划中存在问题，并以新数据集RETAIL和全新框架TGMA改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在旅行规划中存在:假设用户具有明确需求、忽视环境因素及用户偏好、生成简单计划等缺陷。

Method: 构建RETAIL数据集支持隐式及显式查询，并提出主题引导多代理框架（TGMA），兼顾环境意识和细节丰富的旅行规划。

Result: 实验表明现有最强模型通过率仅为1.0%，而TGMA显著提升到2.72%。

Conclusion: TGMA框架在真实世界旅行规划上表现出改善潜力，标志着研究的方向性进展。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 由于现有的自动化方法在跨任务泛化和开放式推理支持方面的局限性，该研究旨在提升心电图自动诊断的性能，同时扩展模型的泛化能力和医学推理能力。

Method: DiagECG通过一个独立于导联的编码器和量化模块，将连续的ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，以扩展LLM的词汇表，使模型能够统一处理ECG和自然语言输入。同时，模型被预训练于自回归ECG预测任务上，并针对ECG问答及诊断报告生成进行了指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在无需修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务中表现出色，且在分布外的设置上也展现了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 符号化的ECG表示在LLM中融合，为医学推理提供了新的潜力，而本文提出的方法展示了其在心电图分析中的有效性与创新性。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

benchmarks show that the reformulated task can be effectively solved in
practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and

automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为“Think in Blocks”的框架，旨在使大语言模型根据任务复杂性动态调整推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在复杂逻辑推理任务表现出色，但冗长的推理链可能导致过度计算和响应时间延长，推动了根据任务复杂性动态调整推理深度的需求。

Method: 提出Think in Blocks框架，通过分区推理为可调节块数，并由三阶段训练流程（监督微调、直接偏好优化和强化学习）来动态调整模型推理深度。

Result: 可以动态控制推理深度，提高不同任务的响应效率，并在部署过程中灵活调整推理链长度。

Conclusion: 该框架可以根据任务需求灵活调整推理深度，是一种有效应对复杂性和效率需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: 研究展示了大语言模型在复杂社交场景中制定策略的新框架，证明了组间竞争反直觉地提高合作性的可能性，对未来多智能体设计及与人类价值的对齐具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Motivation: 现有LLMs在3D场景中的工具使用面临问题，尤其是由于问题过于简单导致生成的推理链较短。

Result: 实验表明，经过优化后，LLMs在复杂3D推理任务上的能力大幅提升。

Conclusion: 在复杂3D推理任务中，优化的工具链策略显著提高了LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Motivation: 现有强化学习策略缺乏正式的方法来验证其在安全关键系统中的鲁棒性与安全性。

Method: 通过动力系统理论（尤其是FTLE）与LCS进行分析，并引入三种定量度量指标（MBR, ASAS, TASAS）和局部稳定性保证以评估策略行为。

Result: 实验证明，该框架能全面解读和评估策略行为，并识别基于回报判断成功策略中的关键缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为基于强化学习的策略提供了安全性和鲁棒性评估，同时可辅助改进策略设计与实施。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM)的向量符号系统，用于替代ACT-R的声明性记忆系统，并进行了与Lisp ACT-R的适配，使得现有基于ACT-R的模型可以轻松使用HDM模块运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进ACT-R的声明性记忆系统，以引入更好的可扩展性和基于架构定义的相似性能力。

Method: 开发了基于HDM的各类ACT-R功能，包括一个用于添加大文档内容的文本处理流程，以及基于向量表征的记忆检索机制的设计。同时进行与Lisp ACT-R的适配。

Result: 初步实验结果表明HDM可以维持其向量符号的优越性（如无需储存完整块即可进行记忆召回），且现有的ACT-R模型可以基本无变化地运行在新系统上。

Conclusion: HDM实现了ACT-R声明性记忆的替代方案，在保持其现有能力基础上提升了系统扩展性，下一步将进一步改进其时间上下文表征，并在决策建模上进行更深入应用测试。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体强化学习中，理解团队中各成员的个体行为对于可靠部署系统至关重要。然而，在缺乏价值反馈的情况下，推断个体智能体的贡献具有挑战性。

Method: 采用基于信息理论 Shapley 值的“预期合作值（ICVs）”方法，通过评估智能体对队友策略的不确定性及偏好对齐产生的影响来量化其对团队任务成功的因果影响。

Result: 在协作与竞争的 MARL 环境中，分析揭示了智能体采用的策略是更趋向类似还是多样化，并确定了哪些行为通过决策的确定性或灵活性增加了团队成功的可能性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法首次实现了通过策略分布数据来分析团队合作动态，并增强了 MARL 系统的可解释性。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and

TL;DR: 本论文提出并实施了一种方法，用于测量大规模AI推理任务中能耗、碳排放和耗水量，结果表明Gemini AI的能耗和环境影响远低于公众预估的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI的应用加速普及，但尚无人研究其在实际生产环境中的环境影响指标，需要弥补该研究空白。

Method: 设计并执行测量AI推理任务能耗、碳排放和耗水量的综合方法，覆盖AI推理基础设施全栈，并在谷歌Gemini AI智能助手服务中进行详细分析。

Result: 结果显示，Gemini Apps中位文本请求消耗0.24瓦时能量，碳足迹和能耗较之前分别减少44倍和33倍，用水量仅为五滴水的水平。

Conclusion: 尽管AI服务的环境影响相较于其他日常活动较低，但环境指标的全面测量对模型比较和效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种框架，通过实时评估对话中的指标以识别是否存在寄生社会信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决寄生社会关系对人类福祉的负面影响，并提出方法防止其出现。

Method: 利用当前语言模型，构建了一个对话评估框架，并测试了这一框架在合成数据集中识别寄生社会信号的能力。

Result: 框架能够成功识别出所有寄生社会对话，同时避免了假阳性，检测通常发生在对话前几轮交换中。

Conclusion: 结果表明，评估代理可以成为防止寄生社会关系的可行解决方案。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法缺乏对配置优化的动态适应性和语义推理能力，需解决模型架构、训练策略、特征工程和超参数的综合协调优化问题。

Method: 通过多代理大型语言模型（LLM），引入文本梯度作为补充信号，采用三代理协同方式：Advisor建议配置变更，Evaluator评估改进情况，Optimizer优化决策过程。

Result: 在六个多样数据集上的全面评估显示，LGT在性能和可解释性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LGT框架有效地提升了机器学习配置优化的动态适应性能和语义推理能力，在多种场景下体现了其广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: 首次展示了在真实场景中使用安全强化学习技术进行伦理决策的潜力，有望推动混合交通环境中伦理负责的自动驾驶发展。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种个性化肺癌风险预测模型，通过动态选择最适合患者的预测模型来提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的肺癌风险预测模型由于患者群体和临床设定的多样性，表现不具普适性。需要一种能够结合群体特异性知识的个性化预测模型。

Method: 提出一种两阶段的预测代理：首先通过FAISS进行相似性搜索检索与患者最相关的群体；然后使用大型语言模型（LLM）根据检索结果和性能指标推荐最佳预测算法。

Result: 新方法能够实现动态、基于群体的个性化风险预测，通过九个现实世界数据集验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: 此方法为实现个体化风险评估提供了可行的方案，特别适用于肺癌筛查中的多样化临床人群。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Motivation: 研究帕金森病症状复杂演变模型不足的现状，开发一种更有效的方法以捕获时间依赖性和结构关系，从而精确预测疾病进展。

Method: 利用图神经网络表现多模态临床症状间的结构关系，引入Transformer模型刻画病程中的动态时间特征，并通过结构感知门控机制动态调整结构编码与时间特征的融合权重；多组件建模模块协同运作完成预测。

Result: 实验表明提出的方法在AUC、RMSE和IPW-F1指标上优于现有模型，同时能够有效区分病程阶段并捕捉个性化症状轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架具有良好的泛化性及结构扩展能力，对帕金森病及其他慢性进展性疾病的智能建模提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Motivation: 现有的文本分类NAS模型因搜索空间过大且无序，导致现有强化学习方法难以高效优化。

Method: 提出基于分层混合结构的架构搜索方法，设计特定的结构模板以组织搜索空间，并利用Q学习引导自适应变异策略进行搜索。

Result: 在Spider数据集上，本方法相比基准模型在测试准确率上提升了8%。

Conclusion: 新方法能够有效探索搜索空间，发现高性能架构，显示了在文本分类任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Method: 提出LPO框架，创新地实现梯度解耦、质量稳定性提升以及可控拒绝抑制。

Result: LPO提升了文本、数学及语音等任务的性能，实验结果稳定出色。

Conclusion: LPO是一种稳定且可调的偏好对齐方法，相关代码、模型和数据已开源。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了广告推荐领域中基于大规模预训练模型的局限性，并提出了LFM4Ads框架，通过全表现和多粒度机制提升推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在广告推荐中仅提取用户表示（URs），忽视了物品表示（IRs）和用户-物品交互表示（CRs）；此外，简单使用URs作为下游特征也存有不足。

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架，全面转移URs、IRs和CRs，并通过非线性适配器、同构交互模块以及独立检索实现多粒度传输机制。

Result: LFM4Ads在腾讯广告平台成功部署，每日处理数十亿样本，实现GMV提升2.45%，估算年增收达数亿美元。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads展示了全面表示和多粒度方法对广告推荐系统的显著影响，并在实际部署中取得盈利提升。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

TL;DR: 本文提出CuMoLoS-MAE，一种基于深度学习的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自动编码器，用于修复遥感仪器中因低信噪比、折叠范围和不连续点造成的大气数据缺失并量化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高大气遥感数据的准确性，解决传统方法模糊细节和深度模型缺乏置信度估计的问题。

Method: 通过制定掩码比率课程训练，利用ViT解码器从稀疏上下文重构，通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码实现后验预测，以获得高置信重建和像素级不确定性图。

Result: 有效恢复包括上升气流和下降气流核心、切变线和小涡流的细节特征，并为对流诊断、数据同化和长时间气候再分析提供支持。

Conclusion: CuMoLoS-MAE显著提高了遥感仪器数据还原的精度，并提供了在实时诊断和气候研究中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible

### [168] [Generative Neural Operators of Log-Complexity Can Simultaneously Solve Infinitely Many Convex Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14995)
*Anastasis Kratsios,Ariel Neufeld,Philipp Schmocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究生成平衡算子 (GEO) 在解决凸优化问题族时的理论和实践表现，证明了其参数需求可随着逼近误差的倒数成对数增长，验证了其在多个实际应用中的有效性和可训练性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算子在无限维度空间中操作，虽理论上需大量参数支持，但实验表现却相反，研究者意在弥合理论与实践上的巨大差距。

Method: 设计了一种生成的平衡算子 (GEO)，结合有限维深度平衡层，应用于可分希尔伯特空间问题，输入为光滑凸函数，输出为其优化问题的近似解。

Result: 证明了对于输入损失函数落于特定紧集的情况，GEO能以对数增长的参数需求达至任意逼近精度，并在三个领域应用中验证了其有效性：非线性偏微分方程问题、随机最优控制问题以及具流动性约束的金融对冲问题。

Conclusion: GEO不仅理论上展示了对凸优化问题族的有效解决能力，且实际在多应用场景中表现出高效的训练能力，为神经算子理论和应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动分区方法在探索分区空间时要么因内存不足失败，要么过于缓慢，需要高效、自动化的新方法解决此问题。

Method: 通过静态编译器分析构建高效的决策空间，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索算法解决分区冲突和优化问题。

Result: 该系统在多种硬件平台和模型架构上表现超过现有方法，能发现新的、更优的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的方法加速了自动分区过程，适用于复杂和大型模型部署，实现了全面自动化并能提升性能。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEAL（Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning）的新型图神经网络，用于通过归因学习解释分子图中的子结构对模型预测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在预测分子属性方面表现优异，但由于其“黑箱”特性，缺乏可解释性，限制了其在例如药物研发等关键领域的信任与应用。同时，现有的解释技术在量化单个原子或子结构贡献方面存在不足。

Method: SEAL通过将输入分子图分解为化学上有意义的片段，并通过减少片段间的信息传递来估计这些片段对模型输出的因果影响，从而对模型预测进行更清晰的归因。

Result: 在多种综合基准测试和真实分子数据集上的实验表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类一致性解释方面都优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SEAL实现了预测性能与可解释性的平衡，提供了一种更透明且可操作的分子建模方法，为分子建模的实际应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot)，一种将不确定性估计集成到优化过程的新方法，以改善过度参数化和数据匮乏情况下的模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度下降方法无法提供不确定性的度量，尤其在过度参数化和数据匮乏的情况下，容易导致模型过拟合。

Method: 提出了一种称为Twin-Boot的新方法，通过在独立的Bootstrap样本上以并行方式训练两个相同的模型，并通过周期性均值重置让两者保持在同一优化盆地内，从而估计局部（盆地内）的不确定性。同时，利用这个不确定性估计自适应地调整权重采样以实现正则化，偏向于更平坦的解。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法提高了模型的校准能力和泛化能力，同时生成了可解释的不确定性地图。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot方法成功将不确定性估计与优化结合，在复杂问题中改善了模型性能，并提供了更好的校准和可解释性。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Method: 通过理论分析和实验结合，探讨了非线性系统中特征映射设计对激励性能的影响，并在物理系统中通过引入i.i.d控制输入和随机扰动政策确保非主动探索，验证理论。

Result: 实验显示，联邦学习方法下，当参与客户数量增加时，个体客户的收敛性得到显著提升，且方法对非线性动力学系统表现出良好的性能。

Conclusion: 联邦学习可以在分布式环境下有效用于非线性系统识别，参与的客户越多，整体性能越优。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究在异质性腐败率下的稳健估计问题，提出了在各种分布和模型中具有最优速率的估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式学习、联邦学习等应用中，样本可能以不同的概率被破坏。现有方法通常假设腐败是均匀分布或最坏情况，没有考虑异质性结构。为了应对这一现实场景的挑战，本文提出研究这一问题。

Method: 分析了多元有限分布和高斯分布的均值估计，得到所有异质腐败模式下的紧确最小最大速率。同时，在多元高斯均值估计和线性回归中，获得了平方误差最小最大速率，误差与维度$d$相关。

Result: 发现最优估计器可能会丢弃超过某一腐败阈值的样本，而该阈值由腐败率的经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 论文在异构腐败率场景下提供了稳健估计的理论基础和最优速率，对现实问题中的鲁棒学习提供了重要的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Result: 实验结果表明，NGN步长与动量结合后，优化器在步长选择上的鲁棒性显著提升，性能可与当前最优优化器媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: 通过创新性的方法，本文改善了优化器对超参数的稳定性，同时兼具高性能，为深度学习优化器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Method: 提出一种不依赖梯度优化和显式标签的基于最大似然估计的分析框架，分析过参条件下输出特征坍塌现象，并通过“虫洞”解决方案重新定义欺骗样本的输出。

Result: 发现DNN过参情况下输出特征坍塌会提升泛化能力，但过多层数会导致退化，可通过“虫洞”解决方法避免这种退化并统一随机标签与有意义标签。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的理论框架揭示DNN的泛化动态，为研究无监督学习设置下的学习行为提供了新方向，同时也在理论与实际应用间搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型面临多语义性问题，限制了解释性。本文旨在研究稀疏自编码器是否能通过稀疏化改善逻辑解释能力，并首次对其效果进行定量评估。

Method: 引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念分离度量，系统分析Gemma-2-2B模型及多个SAE变体在五个基准上的表现，评估其多语义性减弱和概念分离性，以及提出新的干预方法APP。

Result: 结果表明，SAEs能够减弱多语义性并提高概念分离性。在部分压制策略下，SAEs显示出更精确的概念控制能力，且APP方法在概念移除任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 虽然SAEs在解释性上展现潜力，但稀疏性与下游任务性能存在权衡，强调了针对性干预方法如APP的实际应用价值。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

<details>

Motivation: 通过整合多种先进技术，设计一种高效、模块化、适应输入的长上下文语言模型，以刺激后续研究。

Method: Hydra架构集成了Mamba式结构化状态空间模型（SSM）作为基础，间歇性稀疏全局注意力，基于块的MoE前馈路由及双记忆模块，并制定了分阶段的训练策略。

Result: 初步实验在原型级别（数千万参数，使用合成数据）证明了这一架构实现的可行性以及其可控的专家路由和长上下文处理能力等质性行为。

Conclusion: Hydra提供了一种设计蓝图，结合了多种技术，展示了构建模块化、输入自适应长上下文语言模型的潜力，但在目标规模上的端任务验证尚需未来研究。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Motivation: 因T2I生成模型可能侵犯隐私、版权和安全，研究者希望开发有效的概念消除技术以阻止生成指定的“不需要”的目标概念。

Method: 提出了一个新的评估基准Side Effect Evaluation（SEE），包括分层和组合提示，并通过自动化管线从概念邻近性、目标规避及属性泄漏等方面量化CETs的副作用。

Result: 研究表明，CETs容易被通过超类-子类层级及语义相似提示绕过，还表现出属性泄漏及注意力异常分散等现象。

Conclusion: 当前概念消除技术存在明显缺陷，需更深入研究以提升其鲁棒性。研究公开了相关数据集、代码和评估工具，以推动后续发展。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了该方法能有效遗忘指定数据，同时保持其他数据的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种创新性方法，应对“源数据不可得”条件下的遗忘需求，不仅高效且具有理论可靠性。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Motivation: 目前关于差分隐私机器学习(DPML)的研究中，虽然提出了许多全新技术并声称达到了新的最先进水平，但在不同代码库、数据集和方法学之间缺乏一致的有效性评估。

Method: 通过对最近研究文献中11种最新DPML技术进行可重现性和可重复性实验(R+R)，以评估它们在不同条件下的表现。

Result: 发现一些技术经得起验证，而另一些方法在初始实验条件之外表现不佳，同时探讨了差分隐私机制中额外随机性带来的可重复性问题。

Conclusion: 文章提出了如何解决DPML独特挑战的见解和最佳实践，为获得科学可靠的研究结果提供指导。

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SafeLLM的新型防御框架，通过去遗忘机制减少大型语言模型（LLMs）的有害知识生成，同时保留语言流畅性和通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能通过被绕过的对齐机制生成有害内容，现有方法难以精确控制有害行为并对未知攻击不够鲁棒，因此需要一个既能保证安全性又能维持模型性能的解决方案。

Method: SafeLLM采用三阶段流程：(1) 使用外部分类器与内部评估结合的方法检测不安全输出；(2) 通过前馈网络（FFN）激活追踪有害内容；(3) 采用约束优化压制不安全行为，并采用目标和不可逆的遗忘方法。

Result: 实验表明，SafeLLM能够显著减少攻击成功率，并在多个大型语言模型和基准测试上保持高性能，与现有方法相比具有更强的安全保障和对有害行为的精确控制，同时对未知攻击具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SafeLLM展示了去遗忘机制在提高LLM安全性方面的潜力，是一种可扩展且有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保机器学习算法在高风险决策中结果的公平性，同时弥补当前公平性预处理方法研究和工具标准化的不足。

Method: 开发一个名为FairPrep的模块化基准框架，集成数据集、公平性干预和预测模型，支持批量处理和自动报告公平性与效用指标。

Result: FairPrep通过标准化管道实现了高效试验和可重复评估，填补了数据层面公平性研究的空白。

Conclusion: FairPrep为数据层公平性研究提供了一个实用基础，有助于推动公平性预处理方法的研究和应用。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Motivation: 张量神经网络尽管在高维问题中表现优异，但其表达复杂高频特征的能力受到频率原理的限制。

Method: 通过傅里叶分析研究训练动态，引入随机傅里叶特征，并结合张量结构使用离散傅里叶变换提取高维函数的频率特征，从而提出了频率自适应的张量神经网络算法。

Result: 实验验证了所提出频率自适应算法在处理复杂多尺度问题中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了张量神经网络在高维复杂问题中的表达能力，为频率特征分析提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多归因学习（MAL）框架，用于提升转化率（CVR）预测，通过结合多种归因机制信号，改进用户转化模式的捕获能力，并在实验中证明了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在线广告系统中，CVR预测多使用单一归因机制标签进行训练，忽略了不同归因机制信号的互补性，这限制了预测性能的提升。

Method: 提出了一种多归因学习框架（MAL），包括归因知识聚合器（AKA）和主目标预测器（PTP）。AKA通过多任务学习整合多种归因标签的知识，而PTP则对系统优化的归因指标（如最后点击归因下的CVR）生成可直接部署的预测概率。此外，引入了一种名为CAT的训练策略，通过笛卡尔积生成增强的监督信号，大幅提升归因知识聚合性能。

Result: 在离线实验中，MAL实现了GAUC指标提升0.51%，在线实验中，ROI提升了2.6%。

Conclusion: 通过结合多样的归因视角和创新的训练策略，MAL有效增强了CVR预测性能，同时满足工业环境的部署要求。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: 本文的方法在准确性与可解释性两个目标上提供了局部最优性保障，提高了解释生成的扩展能力，可作为帕累托最优探索的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多窗口对比学习框架来提高心电图（ECG）分析模型的表现，同时减少训练时间和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习在心电图分析中的表现受限于标注数据的匮乏，而现有对比学习方法通常仅构建两视角，不充分利用ECG的丰富时间结构特性。

Method: 设计了一个多窗口对比学习框架，从每个心电图数据中提取多个时间窗口以构建正样本对，通过最大化它们的一致性来学习时间不变且生理上有意义的特征。该方法基于慢特征分析原则，强化模型对时间维度的特定特征学习能力。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上的实验结果显示：相比传统两视角方法，本文提出的多窗口方法在多标签分类任务中表现更优，AUROC从0.888提升至0.891，F1从0.679提升至0.680，同时显著减少了训练周期（128减少到32）和总计算开销（减少14.8%）。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习框架被证明是一种高效且可扩展的心电图分析方法，也为生物医学时间序列数据的自监督表示学习提供了新的通用方法框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

Motivation: 探讨数据集复杂性，并评估CSG指标在知识图谱多关系链接预测中的适用性及其与模型性能的相关性。

Method: 通过引入基于变换器的嵌入表示，分析CSG指标在知识图谱中的表现，并对一系列结构性和语义性复杂性指标进行基准测试。

Result: CSG不仅对参数敏感且无法稳健地与类数量成比例，其与标准性能指标（如MRR和Hit@1）的相关性较弱。同时，提出的其他复杂性指标如关系熵等，与任务难度有更强的相关性。

Conclusion: CSG作为复杂性指标在知识图谱背景下的稳定性和推广预测能力未能成立，亟需开发更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的复杂性度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Motivation: 解决训练数据中的偏见导致机器学习模型在少数群体中产生不公平的问题，通过用户侧方法而非依赖组织实现公平性。

Method: 提出三种与具体模型无关的近似理想重新标注的方法，并通过真实世界数据集进行验证。

Result: 验证实验显示少数群体中的一个子群可以大幅减少不公平性，同时对整体预测误差影响较小。

Conclusion: 用户协作重新标注数据是一种可行且有效的降低算法不公平性的途径，不损害模型整体性能。

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

TL;DR: EvoFormer为动态图表示学习引入一个进化感知的Transformer框架，通过解决结构访问偏差和突变进化失明问题，实现了在多个基准任务上的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图嵌入方法在应对高出度节点偏重采样导致的冗余表征（结构访问偏差）以及对结构突变感知不足（突变进化失明）方面存在不足。

Method: EvoFormer引入结构感知Transformer模块和进化敏感时间模块，分别通过基于节点结构角色的定位编码和三步时间演进建模策略优化图嵌入的空间和时间表征。

Result: EvoFormer在五个基准数据集上表现出色，在图相似性排名、时间异常检测和时间分段任务中实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过解决传统方法中的结构与时间偏差，EvoFormer证明了其在捕捉动态图多维特性上的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Result: CITE数据集成为首个且规模最大的异质TAG基准，验证了其在节点分类任务中对多种模型评价的实用性。

Conclusion: CITE填补了异质TAG领域大规模基准数据集的空白，为研究提供了重要资源，助推了方法开发和跨模型公平比较。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Conclusion: 该方法在处理分布式数据时具有显著优势，尽管计算成本相对较高。

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

TL;DR: 提出一种混合最小二乘法/梯度下降法加速DeepONet训练，主要通过将输出参数分成两部分分别优化，同时利用分解法降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepONet训练方法可能效率低下，特别是在处理大规模系统时，提出本方法旨在加速训练过程并使其更加高效。

Method: 将DeepONet最后一层参数通过最小二乘法优化，其余隐藏层参数用梯度下降法更新。同时利用分解策略将大的最小二乘系统分解为更小的子问题，从而降低计算规模和复杂性。

Result: 实现了对大规模输入的训练加速，且方法可推广至带正则化项或无监督学习的L^2损失优化中。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了DeepONet的训练效率，并可推广应用于其他类型的优化问题。

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前人类活动识别（HAR）模型在应对不同用户时表现一般，性能下降主要因用户引起的概念漂移（UICD）。因此，研究提出了一种能够快速高效实现个性化的方案。

Method: 研究提出一种结合跨用户通用化与基于少样本学习的用户个性化适应的混合框架。在RISC-V架构的GAP9微控制器上运行，仅更新分类器层以实现高效的个性化适应。

Result: 在三种不同的HAR场景（RecGym、QVAR-Gesture、Ultrasound-Gesture）中进行验证，部署后分别实现了3.73%、17.38%和3.70%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 验证结果表明，在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量化的个性化是可行的，为规模化和用户感知的HAR系统的实践应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Method: 设计了一种专注于检测重叠的分布衡量方法，特别针对高斯分布簇，克服了现有方法对于簇的形状和计算效率的不足。

Result: 该方法比现有方法计算更快数倍，能够有效检测重叠簇，并避免正交簇的合并。

Conclusion: 新方法高效弥补了传统技术缺陷，为在线学习中处理流数据提供了有力工具，可提升簇优化效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: MRP方法在提高机器遗忘的有效性和安全性方面取得突破，同时维持模型的自然性能，展现了很有前景的应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 该模型为动态分子开关作为计算单元在神经形态计算中的使用提供支持，也启发了可用来稳定处理输入信号的其他可精确求解的生物启发模型开发。

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Conclusion: BaVerLy显著提升了神经网络局部稳健性验证的效率，为安全关键应用的稳健性分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Conclusion: 双曲几何可作为蛋白质-配体建模的有效偏导向，表明其在虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is

computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为SPOF的差分隐私训练机制，适用于多用户本地差分隐私，重点在于通过多项式近似扰动来替代传统的梯度噪声注入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私机制（如DP-SGD）在稳定性和计算效率上存在不足，尤其在多用户环境下。研究旨在引入一种支持多用户隐私保护且更高效稳定的算法。

Method: 提出一种基于稳定化的泰勒展开多项式近似的损失函数扰动方法，将噪声加入多项式系数，以替代梯度噪声注入模式。

Result: 在无线环境下与改进版DP-SGD进行对比实验（含异质用户数据与环境噪声），SPOF在重构精度上平均提升3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%。

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户差分隐私场景中展示了更优的隐私与效用平衡，同时具备计算效率和训练稳定性上的显著提升。

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

*Xin Du,Sikun Yang,Wouter Duivesteijn,Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合保序预测和特殊模型挖掘的新框架，用于评估机器学习模型性能在数据子群中的异常表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗、金融），精确了解机器学习模型性能至关重要，以确保其负责任的部署。

Method: 引入了保序化特殊模型挖掘框架（Conformalized Exceptional Model Mining），利用更严格的保序预测和解释性的特殊模型挖掘，开发了mSMoPE（多通道软模型性能评估）模型并定义质量评估指标RAUL来分析子群性能模式。

Result: 通过分析多分类和回归任务中的不同数据集，框架成功识别出可解释的子群，这些子群提供了模型行为的关键见解。

Conclusion: 此方法为模型解释性和可靠性提升奠定了基础，推进了解释性AI和不确定性量化的研究前沿。

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

*Ortal Senouf,Antoine Wehenkel,Cédric Vincent-Cuaz,Emmanuel Abbé,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全新的全归纳和摊销式基于模拟推断(SBI)方法，通过整合校准和分布对齐，提供单一端到端可训练模型，以应对模型设定错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SBI如RoPE方法虽然处理模型设定错误有效，但需要在推断时预先访问一批测试样本，限制了其可扩展性与泛化能力。

Method: 利用小批量的最优传输(OT)对齐真实和模拟数据分布，并通过条件正态流训练近似OT推导的后验分布，无需在推断时访问仿真模型。

Result: 与现有的RoPE和其他标准SBI方法相比，该方法在多个合成和真实基准测试中表现出色，尤其在复杂医学生物标记估计中具有更优越的性能，同时增强了可扩展性和适用性。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅匹配甚至超越RoPE性能，同时克服了其可扩展性与环境适配性挑战，是更高效的SBI解决方案。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的连续神经主题模型(CoNTM)，能够在不遗忘已学主题的情况下持续学习新主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的动态主题模型无法动态更新，而在线主题模型缺乏长期记忆，因此需要一种能够持续学习且具备长期记忆的主题模型。

Method: 使用全局先验分布的持续更新以实现不遗忘已学内容的连续学习。

Result: 实验表明，CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面优于动态主题模型，并且在线捕捉主题变化的能力更强。

Conclusion: CoNTM能学习更多样的主题，且较现有方法能更好地捕捉时间上的变化，证明了其在连续学习中的有效性。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种旨在提高机器学习中个体公平性的框架，其在训练过程中确保公平性并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习算法难以实现个体公平性，同时缺乏能够保证公平性的训练方法，因此需要一个既能提升公平性又带有正式保证的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架，包含两个部分：公平模型初始化和公平性维持的训练算法，同时采用随机化响应机制来保护敏感属性并保证公平性。

Result: 实验验证表明，所提方法生成的模型在公平性和准确性上均表现良好，且效率高于基于认证训练的替代方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够正式保证个体公平性，同时具备良好的实际效果和更高的训练效率，具有潜在的实践价值。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物治疗中，在稀疏采样数据下准确预测药物剂量-反应是实现精确治疗的核心需求。为解决这一挑战，研究旨在开发更高效的预测模型。

Method: 研究提出了基于Transformer的AICMET模型，结合了机械隔室先验和贝叶斯推理，并通过大量仿真药代动力学数据进行预训练，从而在推理时利用先验知识实现零样本适应新药物。

Result: 实验表明，AICMET在公开数据集中超越了传统的非线性混合效应模型和最新的神经ODE模型，不仅在预测精确度上表现出色，还能精准量化患者之间的变异性。

Conclusion: AICMET为基于Transformer的个性化药代动力学建模提供了一条新路径，为实现真正基于人群的个性化剂量方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Conclusion: 本文开发的环境为研究开放式多智能体社会智能的AI提供了平台，证明了社会学习和合作对智能体训练的重要性。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Motivation: 提升PECANN在求解复杂科学计算问题中的稳健性、效率和适用性。

Method: 提出多种改进方法，包括支持多独立惩罚参数的ALM推广、通过期望约束降低内存开销、引入傅里叶特征映射、时间窗口技术以及条件自适应处罚更新策略（CAPU）。

Conclusion: 这些改进方法集体提高了PECANN的稳健性、效率和适用性，使其适合解决高难度的科学计算问题。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Motivation: 研究旨在解释量子退火采样在过去研究中未能显著提升RBM训练性能的原因，同时探讨混合采样策略是否能弥补这些不足。

Method: 研究对比了量子退火器与经典MCMC采样性能，并提出一种混合采样方法，将两者结合应用于RBM训练中。同时探讨了量子退火生成样本在缓解灾难性遗忘中的潜力。

Result: 量子退火采样在训练RBM中未带来显著提升。研究表明，量子退火器在较低概率区域的采样优势，并未在提高样本质量方面表现出决定性作用，但在缓解灾难性遗忘任务中体现了一定前景。

Conclusion: 虽然量子退火采样对RBM训练的贡献有限，但其在生成多样化样本方面表现出的潜力，或可应用于如缓解灾难性遗忘等机器学习任务中，在进一步优化后预计具有更广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在带宽受限的环境中训练大型语言模型（LLM）时，现有方法通常需要通信完整的模型梯度，导致通信瓶颈。同时，现有方法在量化上受限，无法利用稀疏化，这限制了效率提升空间。

Method: SparseLoCo结合了Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，并使用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈来实现通信效率的提升，同时优化模型性能。

Result: SparseLoCo在多种受限通信的LLM训练环境中表现出色，在通信成本和模型性能上都具有显著优越性。

Conclusion: 通过利用稀疏化和量化技术，SparseLoCo能够在带宽受限的环境中有效训练LLM，显著降低通信成本，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

### [225] [Tutorial on the Probabilistic Unification of Estimation Theory, Machine Learning, and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15719)
*Mohammed Elmusrati*

Conclusion: 这项工作总结了统计和机器学习领域的理论和实践，为学生和研究人员提供了关于机器学习不断发展的全景视角。

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

### [226] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas Järve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成模型中的数据似然性作为OOD检测的有效性，并通过在更高层次的表示空间进行实验验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型中的数据似然性被认为是最自然的OOD得分，但其其实效性在实践中受质疑，因此探索其在不同表示空间中对OOD检测的表现至关重要。

Method: 本文训练了一个基于表示空间（而非像素空间）的变分扩散模型，通过对比OpenOOD方法评估其基于数据似然性的检测能力。

Result: 结果显示在使用ResNet-18预训练的表示空间时，基于数据似然性的方法有可能表现良好，潜在克服了像素空间中的弱点。

Conclusion: 表示空间可能是改进OOD检测性能的关键，数据似然性在特定条件下仍有较好的效果。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种有效的实时检测工具，可在多智能体强化学习系统中显著提升针对对抗攻击的检测能力，尤其在连续动作空间中效果卓越。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

*John E. Hummel,Rachel F. Heaton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 研究探讨人类大脑如何实现象征性思维，提出动态绑定、多位置谓词和结构映射是其基本要求，并通过17个模拟实验验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何人类能够进行象征性思维，而大多数动物无法做到，以及象征性思维所需的基本条件。

Method: 设计并执行17个系统性模拟，测试具有或不具有多位置谓词和结构映射能力的认知架构在完成各种任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对人类大脑实现象征性思维的理解，并为仿生人工智能领域提供了重要的启示。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.
