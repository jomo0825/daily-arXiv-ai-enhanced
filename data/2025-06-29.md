### [1] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OTSurv的新方法，基于最佳传输（OT）理论，解决数字病理领域生存预测中的病理异质性问题，并在多项基准上取得最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多示例学习（MIL）方法难以在全局和局部层次上捕捉WSI中的病理异质性，作者希望引入更精准的建模方法优化生存预测。

Method: 基于最佳传输理论，提出OTSurv框架。通过设定两种限制（全局长尾限制与局部不确定性限制）来解决病理异质性问题，并通过矩阵缩放算法解决不平衡的最佳传输问题。

Result: 在六个流行基准上设立新的最佳结果，并在平均C-index上取得3.6%的绝对提升，同时在log-rank测试中表现出统计显著性。

Conclusion: OTSurv不仅在预测性能上表现卓越，还具有高解释性，是数字病理领域生存预测的有力工具。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

### [2] [StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20756)
*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了StereoDiff，一个结合了立体匹配与视频深度扩散的两阶段视频深度估计模型，解决了动态和静态区域的一致性要求问题，并在多种基准测试上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频深度估计方法受到图像深度估计方法的影响，但尚未充分考虑到视频中特定要求，例如动态与静态区域的时序一致性，这需要更专业的解决方法。

Method: 提出了StereoDiff，该方法分两阶段：1.对静态区域采用立体匹配获取更强的全局3D信息；2.对动态区域利用视频深度扩散模型学习一致的深度过渡，确保平滑性。同时，利用频域分析验证了两部分协同的互补性。

Result: 实验证明StereoDiff在室内和室外动态视频深度估计基准测试中，都实现了零样本状态下的最先进表现，具备优秀的一致性与精确度。

Conclusion: 这种结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散方法的创新策略能够更好地满足动态和静态区域的不同需求，在视频深度估计领域树立了新标杆。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [3] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ConViTac网络，通过对比学习增强视觉与触觉的特征融合，显著提升材料分类和抓取预测任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-触觉联合学习方法对信息融合处理不足，特征集成效果差。

Method: 通过一种自监督对比学习预训练的编码器将视觉和触觉输入投射为统一的潜在嵌入，并结合跨模态注意力机制对特征进行高效融合。

Result: 在多项实际任务中，相较于现有方法，显示出更好表现，材料分类及抓取预测任务精度提升了最高12.0%。

Conclusion: 通过自监督对比学习和跨模态融合，ConViTac显著提升了机器人视觉与触觉任务的表现。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

### [4] [AI-Driven MRI-based Brain Tumour Segmentation Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20786)
*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了多种分割模型在BraTS 2023数据集上的表现，指出虽然SAM等模型在高质量提示下超越nnU-Net，但总体实用性不如nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来大量医疗图像分割模型被引入，但缺乏系统比较各模型在不同提示条件下表现的研究。

Method: 选用SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net，在BraTS 2023数据集上对多种提示设计进行零样本推断，并进一步通过微调模型扩展比较。

Result: SAM和SAM 2在高质量框选提示下表现出优异Dice分数（分别达0.894和0.893），但nnU-Net仍在实际操作中占优。此外，微调提升了点提示性能，但未能超越nnU-Net。

Conclusion: 尽管新型模型在高质量提示条件下表现良好，但由于提示不可行性，nnU-Net仍是当前最佳医疗分割网络。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

### [5] [How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795)
*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究对动态全身手势识别进行比较，提出了一个新的数据集NUGGET，最终发现HD-GCN表现最好，但V-JEPA表现接近，有潜力简化系统复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何使用视觉基础模型（VFMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）替代传统手势识别中的专用任务模块，以减少系统复杂性。

Method: 引入一个新的数据集NUGGET，用于在人机通信环境中评估不同的手势识别方法；测试了V-JEPA、Gemini Flash 2.0和HD-GCN，并比较其性能。

Result: HD-GCN表现最佳；V-JEPA在加上简单的分类头后表现接近；Gemini在基于文本描述进行零样本手势识别时表现较差。

Conclusion: HD-GCN继续领先于手势识别领域，但V-JEPA显示出通过共享多任务模型来简化系统的潜力，而Gemini需要进一步研究以优化其输入表示。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [6] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过视觉-语言模型 (VLMs) 选择扩散生成超分辨率 (SR) 图像中最可信样本的方法，并使用新的可信度分数 (TWS) 验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超分辨率问题中，现有方法在平衡清晰度与感知质量上存在局限，扩散模型虽然可以生成多样化的解决方案，但缺乏可靠性评估机制。为此，该论文旨在开发一种自动、鲁棒的系统以选择最可信的超分辨率结果。

Method: 论文利用视觉-语言模型 (如BLIP-2, GPT-4o等) 通过结构化查询评估语义正确性、视觉质量和伪影存在。基于此选择的高质量样本进行集成输出，并提出结合语义相似性、结构完整性与伪影敏感性的可信度分数 (TWS) 作为验证指标。

Result: 实验表明，TWS 与人类偏好高度相关，且VLM指导的样本选择能够 consistently 产出高可信度的超分辨率结果，与传统指标相比更符合语义与信息保真性要求。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散超分辨率问题提供了可靠性验证的新基准，通过与人类期望与语义正确性对齐，提高了生成超分辨率图像的可信度和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [7] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的半监督域泛化方法FixCLR，旨在通过对比学习实现领域不变性正则化，并在多个实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督域泛化中标签稀缺时的表现不佳问题，重点在于学习跨所有域的领域不变表示。

Method: 设计FixCLR，借鉴自监督学习中的成功方法，利用伪标签中的类别信息并仅使用排斥项进行对比学习正则化。FixCLR可与现有方法结合提升表现。

Result: 实验表明，FixCLR在半监督方法改进、预训练模型评估以及多域数据集测试中表现卓越。

Conclusion: FixCLR是一个有效的半监督域泛化方法，尤其在与其他半监督方法结合时表现出色。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [8] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的对比学习方法COVER，用于解决像素级表示学习中的过分散问题，从而改善医疗视觉基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的对比学习在扩展到像素级表示学习时存在问题，例如过分散问题会破坏像素间的特征相关性，从而影响类内分布。

Method: 提出了COVER框架，将对比学习从二值优化问题重新构建为向量回归问题，通过回归位移向量量化像素级特征分布，并采用向量金字塔架构实现粒度自适应。

Result: 在不同维度和不同模式下的8个任务上验证了COVER框架的有效性，显著提升了像素级自监督学习的表现。

Conclusion: COVER通过改进的向量回归方法用在像素级预训练中，成功改善了医疗视觉基础模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

### [9] [Enhancing Ambiguous Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with Soft Label-based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20867)
*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MIDAS的数据增强方法，通过对含有模糊情绪标签的面部表情视频序列进行增强，以提升动态面部表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，准确识别含糊的面部表情是一个关键挑战，特别是在野外数据中这种情形经常出现。

Method: 提出了一种通过对视频帧和相应情绪类别软标签进行凸组合的数据增强方法（基于mixup），以处理动态面部表情识别中的模糊性问题。

Result: 实验表明，与仅在原始数据集上训练的最先进方法相比，使用MIDAS增强数据训练的模型性能更优。

Conclusion: MIDAS是一种简单但高效的动态面部表情识别数据增强方法，能够有效应对含糊的面部表情数据。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [10] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为ThirdEye的深度估计方法，通过融合多种单目线索（如遮挡边界、阴影和透视）来提升深度估计结果的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目深度估计方法忽略了人类视觉系统依赖的重要线索，本研究旨在显式引入这些线索来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出一个名为ThirdEye的框架，使用多个预训练网络提取不同单目线索，通过一个三级皮层层次结构进行融合，并引入自适应bin的变换器头部来生成高分辨率视差图。

Result: 该方法提供了更具解释性的架构设计和实验协议，但具体的定量结果将在后续研究中提供。

Conclusion: ThirdEye方法允许引入大量的外部监督信号，在保持较少微调的情况下改进单目深度估计，并具有较强的生物学启发性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决生成多个人类图像时在身份保留和动作复杂性方面的挑战，作者提出了一个标准化的测试基准来填补这一领域的空白。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和发现为多个人类图像生成领域的研究提供了重要的工具和方向。

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model

discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FaSTA$^*$的高效神经符号化代理，用于多回合图像编辑任务，其核心是结合快速高层任务规划和精准工具路径搜索策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多回合图像编辑中成本高昂的问题，通过更智能的规划减少计算资源消耗。

Method: 结合大型语言模型（LLM）进行高层规划，以及针对具体任务的工具使用和局部A$^*$搜索。通过归纳推理提取常用子例程，在任务失败时触发低层搜索，实现了效率与准确性的折中。

Result: 实验表明，FaSTA$^*$在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，并在任务成功率上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过快速任务规划和子例程重用，在高效解决复杂图像编辑任务方面展现了巨大潜力，其人类般快慢结合的规划框架具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

TL;DR: 該研究提出M2SFormer，一種基於Transformer編碼器的新框架來有效偵測與定位圖像偽造，特別是在面對複雜篡改時表現卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基於深度學習的圖像偽造定位方法具有高準確性，但在計算開銷和表現力上存在局限性，尤其對於微弱或複雜的偽造效果難以處理。

Method: M2SFormer框架結合多頻多尺度注意力與難度指導的注意模塊，改善對篡改細節的捕捉與重建性能，並引入曲率指標作為全局先驗圖引導。

Result: 在多個基準數據集上的實驗證明，M2SFormer在檢測和定位跨域偽造圖像時優於現有的最新模型。

Conclusion: M2SFormer方法不僅有效提升了圖像偽造定位的準確性，還具備更好的泛化能力，有助於應用於各種偽造場景。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations

Conclusion: PhysRig成功克服LBS局限性，表现出更高的真实度和多任务适应性，如姿态转移等，为动画制作和建模领域提供了新路径。

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个分层子动作树（HST-CSLR）方法，用于更高效地结合手语的视觉表示学习与文字知识表征，从而提升连续手语识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究中，由于大数据集和精确标注的缺失，影响了连续手语识别的效果，成为其发展瓶颈。同时，已有工作在结合不同模态时，对文字知识的利用不够深度。

Method: 利用大语言模型引入文字模态的知识，提出分层子动作树（HST）用于更高效地表征文字信息，同时通过分步方法对齐视觉与文字模态，并设置对比对齐增强机制以进一步弥补模态间的差距。

Conclusion: HST-CSLR方法通过结合分层文字知识与视觉学习，不仅提升了手语识别性能，还在计算复杂度上获得了优化，为解决标注数据不足问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种高效的零样本视频编辑方法DFVEdit，解决了视频生成模型Video DiTs在编辑时的计算资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video DiTs在直接用于视频编辑时需要大量计算资源，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: DFVEdit通过流变换直接操作于隐藏变量而无需注意力修改和微调，同时结合了条件增量流矢量(CDFV)、隐含交叉注意(ICA)以及嵌入增强(ER)。

Result: 相比基于注意力工程的编辑方法，DFVEdit推理速度提高至少20倍，内存使用减少85%。

Conclusion: DFVEdit不仅高效且具有极佳编辑效果，能够与流行的Video DiTs模型无缝结合并达到结构保真度、时空一致性及编辑质量的先进水平。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了Cradle2Cane，一个基于文本到图像扩散模型的双阶段面部年龄转换框架，解决了年龄准确性和身份一致性之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 致力于解决现有方法在大年龄差距或极端头部姿态下难以实现真实无缝年龄转换的问题，同时平衡年龄准确性与身份保护的矛盾。

Method: 采用了基于文本到图像扩散模型的双阶段框架：第一阶段通过自适应噪声注入机制（AdaNI）实现年龄准确性，第二阶段通过双身份感知嵌入（SVR-ArcFace和Rotate-CLIP）提升身份一致性。这两个阶段为端到端联合训练。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试集上的实验表明，Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane提供了一种有效的面部年龄转换方案，成功解决了年龄准确性与身份保护之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合相机光度优化的3D场景-相机新表征方法，通过分离与场景无关的信息来提升3D场景表示质量，即使在成像退化条件下（如暗角、污迹）仍然表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对多视角图像的场景表示是计算机视觉中的关键任务，但相机成像中的光度失真会降低场景表示质量，因此需要处理这些失真以提升结果。

Method: 引入内部和外部光度模型，提出完整的光度模型及相机表征，通过联合优化相机表征参数分离与场景无关的信息，整合光度模型与深度正则化提升优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，即便在暗角、污迹等成像退化条件下，该方法仍能生成高质量的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: 该方法通过包含场景辐射场和相机光度模型的完整地图构建，提升了3D场景表示的质量，同时解决了成像失真引起的问题。

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Motivation: 现有基于密集信号的姿势引导图像生成方法存在编辑困难和与文本提示不一致等问题，因此探索更加简单、形状无关的稀疏信号具有潜力。

Method: 提出了Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl)，通过扩展 OpenPose 为一种可学习的空间表示，并引入关键点概念学习，以提升姿势对齐和图像生成的精确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SP-Ctrl在动物和人类中心的图像生成任务中优于基于稀疏姿态引导的现有方法，并与基于密集信号的方法表现相当。

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl 不仅展示了稀疏信号在姿势引导图像生成中的潜力，还证明其在跨物种生成任务中的多样性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

Motivation: 探索CZSL中更高效的组合泛化能力，克服现有方法在语义子集分割和细粒度成分对齐上的不足。

Method: 提出了一个基于专家混合模型的框架EVA，包含领域专家适应方案和语义变体对齐策略，用以提高原始概念表示质量和实现更准确的组合泛化。

Result: 方法在三大热门基准测试的闭合和开放世界场景下均显著超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: EVA框架有效提升了CZSL领域的组合泛化能力，验证了新方法的高效性。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Conclusion: TSDASeg模型能够有效解决交互式3D点云任务中的对齐问题，显著提升不同场景下的分割一致性和性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法无需专用数据集即可生成高质量、语义丰富的音频，是视频到音频生成领域的一项重要进展。

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高分辨率图像或静态几何结构假设，无法有效处理动态物体和相机运动场景，因此需要一种鲁棒的新视角生成方法。

Method: 利用稀疏控制高斯点技术（Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting），从单目模糊视频中生成高密度的3D高斯点，恢复视频中的清晰场景，并重建动态运动变化中受影响的3D几何细节。

Result: 提出的方法在动态模糊场景下实现了鲁棒表现，并在单目模糊视频的新视角生成任务中树立了新的标杆。

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS方法提升了动态模糊视频下的新视角生成质量，为理论和实际场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

TL;DR: 本文研究了逆向场景文本移除(ISTR)，即判断图像是否经过场景文本移除，以及本地化被移除的文本区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最初的场景文本移除(STR)旨在删除图片上的敏感或不需要的文本，但随着其应用范围的扩展，误用风险也增加，因而需要开发一种方法来检测和应对这些风险。

Method: 文章提出了一种方法，通过对场景文本移除后的图像进行二分类(是否进行过STR)和被移除文本区域的定位，同时尝试使用文本识别技术恢复文本内容。

Result: 实验表明所提方法在二分类和文本区域定位任务中都取得了高精度，为检测潜在的误用和改进STR提供了可能。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测潜在的STR误用中表现出色，同时还进一步尝试了解恢复文本内容的难度，展示了对STR技术的改进潜力。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对摩托车头盔检测中环境多样性、摄像头角度和数据不一致性等挑战，提出一种改进方法以提高检测的稳定性和可靠性。

Method: 提出VisionGuard框架，包括两个核心模块：1. 自适应标注模块，利用跟踪算法精确修正跨帧分类的一致性。2. 上下文扩展模块，通过生成虚拟框和置信度来解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，VisionGuard在整体mAP指标上相比基线检测器提高了3.1%。

Conclusion: VisionGuard框架在交通监管系统中展现出可行性与有效性，有助于促进交通安全与法规合规性。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前乳腺肿瘤切除术中边缘检测方法存在准确性不足的问题，导致高额的二次手术率。

Method: 作者结合前向-对比学习（FFCL）与Segment Anything Model (SAM)的方法，利用ResNet-18进行初始建模并生成粗略分割，随后借助SAM实现精细化分割。

Result: 该框架的诊断AUC达0.8455，相较于基线模型分割精度（Dice相似度）提升27.4%，推理时间缩短至47ms/图像。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM框架显著增强了乳腺癌中术中边缘检测的实时性和准确性，展示出在降低二次手术率和改善手术疗效方面的潜力。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往模型将衰老视为单一确定路径，而忽视了多样性和外部条件的影响。本研究旨在解决这个问题，提供更个性化和可控的衰老预测。

Method: 采用无训练的基于扩散的方法，结合注意力混合和模拟衰老正则策略，以实现身份保留、年龄准确性和条件控制的平衡。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份保留、衰老真实性和条件对齐方面达到了领先的性能，优于现有的编辑和年龄预测模型。

Conclusion: 通过将衰老转变为多维、可控且可解释的过程，该方法为数字叙事、健康教育和个性化可视化领域带来了创新潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法中3D标注和采样区域受限的问题，同时减轻用户心理负担，拓展场景探索可能性。

Method: 使用局部重建的光场和错误可视化技术，显示需要插入新视图的区域，从而引导用户进行数据采集。

Result: 所提方法通过减少最终结果的失望感和所需样本数量，改善了用户体验，并可应用于更大场景的辐射场重建。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了当前增强现实数据采集中的限制和问题，可为移动视图合成系统提供更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视频质量评估的新方法，通过指令微调大规模多模态模型来提高其视觉质量评估能力，同时用链式推理模型解释视频质量与整体感知的关系，生成具有扩展性和高效的数据集和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频质量评估方法多以数值评分为主，无法充分描述视频的复杂质量维度，同时受限于依赖人工标注和专有系统的数据生成方法，数据扩展性和效率不足。

Method: 提出了基于分数生成指令的SIG管道，评分视频多个质量维度并以文本定义水平表述，结合链式推理模型模拟人类视觉系统的推理过程，以自动化流程生成具有扩展性的数据集，同时设计了一种渐进微调策略提高模型性能。

Result: 生成的Score2Instruct (S2I) 数据集包含320K以上指令-响应对，结合S2I-Bench对方法进行了验证，实验结果表明比现有方法在视频质量评分和解释能力上均有一致改进。

Conclusion: 本文方法显著提升了多模态模型的视频质量评分和解释能力，为扩展性强的视频质量评估提供了数据和方法基础。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

Motivation: 现有基于VLM的FER方法难以捕获区分表情细微差别所需的细粒度文本-视觉关系。

Method: 提出MPA-FER框架，包括多粒度硬提示生成策略、原型引导的视觉特征对齐以及跨模态全局-局部对齐模块。

Result: 所提方法在三大FER基准数据集上性能优于现有技术，同时保留预训练模型的优势并降低计算成本。

Conclusion: MPA-FER框架通过引入细粒度语义和对齐策略，有效改进了VLM在FER任务上的表现。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Conclusion: FedSC通过语义感知的协作机制成功解决了联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，同时增强了收敛的稳定性与模型的性能，对相关领域问题的研究具有积极意义。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: 本研究证明经典-量子融合的图像生成为医学图像处理提供了新方向，且在真实量子硬件上展示了鲁棒性，揭示了量子硬件进步带来的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

Conclusion: LASFNet通过创新的模块设计实现了效率和准确性的良好权衡，有助于推动多模态目标检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

Motivation: 在图像编辑时，达到最佳的编辑性与信实性之间的平衡一直是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种信实性引导与调度方法（FGS），通过信实性引导增强输入图像信息的保留，并通过调度策略解决编辑性和信实性之间的错位问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，FGS在保持编辑性的同时显著提高了信实性。

Conclusion: FGS方法不仅提升了信实性，还能兼容多种编辑方法，实现高质量图像编辑，具有广泛实用性。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Motivation: 通过减少计算需求和存储空间的方式改进现有图像离散表示方法以应对高分辨率图像建模的挑战。

Method: 采用1D二进制向量代替传统的one-hot编码来描述每张图像，同时通过简单模型结构实现加速训练和推理速度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为图像处理提供了比传统标记方法更高效、可扩展的方案，减少计算成本并保持高质量生成。

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Motivation: 商业RGB-D摄像头在处理非朗伯对象时深度图通常包含噪声、不完整性，传统方法效果欠佳，需新的方法改进泛化能力。

Method: 提出DidSee框架，包含调整的噪声调度器、无噪声单步训练公式及语义增强器，并结合特定任务优化模型。

Result: DidSee在多个基准测试中实现了最先进性能，并改进了如姿态估计和机器人抓取等任务效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了训练推理不匹配和非朗伯区域视觉特性不足的问题，显著提升深度图预测精度。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.
Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,
EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 证明扩散模型在领域泛化与适应检测任务中的优越性，并为跨域视觉感知提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究探讨利用自监督学习和Transformer架构提升对抗样本的黑盒迁移能力，通过提出组合全局结构和局部纹理特征的生成模型dSVA，显著提升迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作中深度神经网络(DNN)对抗样本的生成大多依赖有监督学习的中间特征，然而，结合自监督学习与Transformer的优势或可以进一步改进对抗样本的迁移能力。

Method: 通过设计生成式的双重自监督ViT特征攻击系统dSVA，结合对比学习（CL）和掩码图像建模（MIM）的特征，生成黑盒对抗样本，并设计了利用这些特征的生成器和训练策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，利用CL和MIM特征的ViT展示出对不同架构的模型具有出色的对抗样本迁移性能，优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督ViT的双重特征（全球结构和局部纹理特征）的联合利用，可以极大提升对抗样本的迁移能力，并证明其超越现有技术的方法效力。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档分析方法仅适用于固定类别定义和粒度，缺乏灵活性，难以满足用户定制需求。

Method: 提出了"RoI-Matching"任务，构建RoI-Matching-Bench基准，设计了宏微观指标；并提出了RoI-Matcher框架，采用孪生网络提取特征，多层交叉注意力对齐语义。

Conclusion: 本文方法为文档匹配任务提供了新思路及基准，展现了灵活、高效的能力，可支持后续研究。

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的数据集MultiClip-Bench和一个视频大模型IPFormer-VideoLLM，用以解决现有视频大语言模型在多镜头场景下的表现不佳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型无法有效处理镜头变换或场景变化的多镜头视频，其主要问题包括实例身份信息丢失和关键帧忽视。

Method: 提出了新的数据集MultiClip-Bench，包含密集描述和基于指令的问题回答对。同时，提出了IPFormer-VideoLLM，通过高效的注意力连接器将实例级特征注入为提示，从而跨场景聚合实例信息。

Result: 实验表明，新数据集显著提升了模型多镜头场景下的表现，而新模型在多场景视频理解和其他视频基准测试中具有显著优势。

Conclusion: MultiClip-Bench数据集和IPFormer-VideoLLM模型有效增强了多镜头场景的视频理解能力，并且在多种基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为SAMURAI的混合检索框架，通过结合语言和形状特征实现高效的3D目标检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂室内环境中基于受限信息（如遮罩2D图像和自然语言描述）高效检索3D对象难度较大，为此提出改进解决方案。

Method: 提出SAMURAI框架，结合CLIP语义匹配、基于二值轮廓的重排序和多数投票机制，辅以针对遮罩质量的预处理流程。

Result: 在ROOMELSA数据集的私有测试集中取得了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 结合形状先验与语言理解是实现鲁棒3D对象开放世界检索的关键。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为PoseMaster的框架，用于端到端3D角色生成，通过整合姿态转换和3D生成，提高了建模的效率和精准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图像的3D角色建模因自遮挡和视角问题在姿态标准化过程中易产生图像失真，影响后续重建质量，需开发有效的端到端方案解决此问题。

Method: 提出PoseMaster框架，通过3D骨骼作为姿态条件，实现统一的姿态转换和3D生成；训练过程中随机丢弃姿态和图像条件以增强泛化性；并构建高质量的数据集来学习骨骼和蒙皮权重的隐式关系。

Result: PoseMaster在定量和定性评估中均优于现有技术，特别是在A-pose角色生成和精确姿态控制方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PoseMaster通过引入统一框架和高质量数据集，提升了3D角色建模的效果和灵活性，为角色生成和姿态控制提供了更强大的能力。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代自动化系统需要高准确性和实时性能的立体匹配模型，但现有方法在效率和准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: 通过增强的混合与特征融合方法，ESM恢复小规模代价体积的关键信息，并结合轻量级的引导式网络以提升精度。

Conclusion: ESM模型通过创新性方法解决了实时性能和准确性之间的矛盾，为领域带来了高效且具有实际应用价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

Conclusion: OracleFusion为解读甲骨文提供了一种有效工具，通过语义和视觉增强助力提高字符的解读与研究效率。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习在变化检测中的复杂性与计算需求不断增加，但其精度提升有限，轻量化模型在资源有限的卫星环境下尤显重要。

Method: 引入增强差异模块（EDM）放大关键特征差异，结合局部与全局融合块（SWSA与EGSA）实现多尺度语义信息捕获，兼顾粗细粒度变化检测。

Conclusion: FlickCD在性能与资源效率之间取得了卓越平衡，为遥感变化检测提供了更优的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential

segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to

local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal

### [57] [Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21184)
*Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Peitian Zhang,Kun Lun,Huaying Yuan,Juenjie Zhou,Shitao Xiao,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Video-X^2L的方法，通过双层KV压缩和选择性KV重加载解决了长视频理解中因高压缩率带来的信息损失问题，同时提高了多模态大模型的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解任务中面临计算成本高的问题，而现有的KV压缩方法在高压缩率下往往信息丢失严重，需要一种新的方法来平衡信息保留和计算成本。

Method: 提出了Video-X^2L方法，其中包含双层KV压缩和选择性KV重加载两部分：双层KV压缩生成低压缩细节KV（L-KVs）和高压缩简化KV（H-KVs）；而选择性KV重加载在解码阶段选择性加载L-KVs以保留任务关键信息，同时使用H-KVs降低计算负担。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU、LongVideoBench和VNBench等长视频理解基准上，Video-X^2L大幅优于现有KV压缩方法，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L方法简单高效，不需要额外训练，能直接兼容现有KV压缩模型，是一种在解析长视频任务中平衡信息保留与压缩性能的优选方案。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Conclusion: GoIRL框架通过整合逆强化学习与分层规划方法，有效解决轨迹预测的挑战，表现出了优越的性能与通用性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

TL;DR: HalluSegBench是一种新基准，用于评估视觉和语言分割中的幻觉现象，特别是通过视觉反事实推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言分割模型在视觉内容没有对应时会生成错误的分割结果，但现有评估方法主要集中在文本或标签层面，缺乏对视觉场景的深度鉴别，导致关键失败现象未被识别。

Method: 提出了HalluSegBench基准，包括一个1340个反事实实例配对的新数据集、涵盖281种独特对象类别，以及用于量化幻觉敏感性的创新指标。

Result: 通过对HalluSegBench的实验，发现当前先进的视觉-语言分割模型在面对视觉诱导的幻觉时表现不佳，错误分割现象远高于标签驱动的幻觉。

Conclusion: 基准研究表明利用反事实推理能够更有效地诊断模型的视觉和语言结合能力的不足，强调了该评估领域的必要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇文章介绍了一种新型的水印技术BitMark，可以在人类难以察觉的情况下在生成图像的比特级别嵌入水印标记，并且这些标记在经过多次模型微调后仍可检测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着先进的文本生成图像模型的广泛应用，其生成的内容可能被反复用来训练模型，导致模型性能逐步下降的问题（即所谓的模型坍塌）。

Method: 文中提出了一种比特级水印框架BitMark，通过在生成图像的比特流中嵌入不可见但可检测的水印，并确保视觉质量和生成速度不受影响，同时增强水印在应对移除技术时的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该技术不仅能有效标记单次生成的图像，还能在多次模型微调过程中保留标识，具备高放射性特性使水印可被继续检测。

Conclusion: BitMark为识别生成内容提供了强有力的技术手段，从而为防止生成模型坍塌问题提供了一个重要解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有学习方法中，低光照RAW图像增强虽有进展，但在极低照明条件下（低至0.0001lux）效果较差，部分原因是缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 设计了一条成对数据合成流程，用于生成可校准的极低光照RAW数据集SIED，并提出基于扩散模型的框架，结合自适应光照校正模块和颜色一致性损失提升增强效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过构建数据集及提出改进框架，为极低光照RAW图像的增强任务提供了有效基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前表面缺陷检测方法存在特征冗余、细节敏感性不足以及多尺度条件下鲁棒性较差的问题。

Method: 提出了YOLO-FDA框架，采用BiFPN样式架构进行多层特征融合，引入DDFM模块增强空间细节，通过AC和CAF策略提升上下文表示及减少特征噪声。

Result: 实验表明，YOLO-FDA在不同类型和尺度的缺陷检测任务中准确性和鲁棒性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA框架有效解决了当前表面缺陷检测中的主要技术挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

Method: 提出两种基于树结构的语义损失函数，并结合稀疏、无背景注释的训练方法优化模型。

Result: 新方法在由107个类组成的高光谱成像数据集上达到了最先进的性能，同时提升了异类像素检测能力。

Conclusion: 基于树的语义损失方法在不牺牲分类性能的情况下，显著提高了分割和异类像素检测效果，适用于生物医学领域。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Motivation: 目前从单视图图像生成3D对象的技术经常受制于多视图一致性差和几何细节不足的问题。

Method: 方法结合几何先验、感知先验和高斯噪声三种分支，通过互相作用和基于重投影的深度一致策略进行优化，提升了细节表现和视图一致性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过无额外训练模型地结合几何与感知先验，实现了从单视图生成高质量3D对象的目标，具有较大的技术优势。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

Conclusion: 该模型通过有效结合局部与全局信息，在长时间手术视频分析中表现出色，且开源代码可供研究者使用。

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Conclusion: TAM框架通过利用全局拓扑信息，缓解了Sim2Real域间差距问题，为点云数据无监督领域适配提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes数据集上验证了方法的优越性，实现了先进的配准性能。

Conclusion: 本文方法通过解决跨模态配准中的关键问题，提高了图像到点云配准的精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing

To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic

injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion

We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D

Result: GroundFlow模块使3DVG基线方法的准确率提升了7.5%和10.2%，在SG3D基准测试中表现优异，超越了预训练的大型3D语言模型。

Conclusion: GroundFlow为现有3DVG模型引入了时序推理能力，并在SG3D基准中的五个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

*Shadman Sobhan,Kazi Abrar Mahmud,Abduz Zami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一个名为MedPrompt的框架，将大型语言模型和模块化卷积神经网络结合，用于灵活处理多种医疗成像任务，且具有高效性和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的医学图像分析系统通常是任务专用，缺乏灵活性，难以支持用户自定义工作流程。该研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MedPrompt框架，结合提示式大型语言模型（Llama-4-17B）进行高层次的任务规划，并通过模块化卷积神经网络（DeepFusionLab）处理低层次的图像任务。通过动态路由任务相关权重避免重新训练框架，从而增强扩展性。

Result: MedPrompt在19个公共数据集上测试，涵盖12个任务和5种成像方式，实现了97%的端到端正确率和较高的分割及分类性能。

Conclusion: MedPrompt框架通过结合LLMs的解释能力和模块化CNNs的效率，实现了可扩展的提示驱动医疗成像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

*Xiwei Xuan,Ziquan Deng,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个数据质量导向的框架来提升无训练开放词汇语义分割（OVS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于依赖模型的能力或参考集质量不足，本文研究提升参考集质量对OVS的意义。

Method: 设计数据流水线和基于相似性的简单检索方法，构建高质量的参考集。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的评估表明该方法优于现有的所有无训练 OVS 方法。

Conclusion: 数据导向设计对提升无训练的开放词汇语义分割至关重要。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

*Tajamul Ashraf,Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法TITAN，旨在解决无源域自适应目标检测问题，尤其是在源数据不可用时进行模型调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无源域自适应目标检测方法存在模型性能下降的问题，主要由于教师模型崩溃，这归因于伪标签中的高噪声和领域偏差等问题。

Method: 提出了TITAN方法，将目标域图像分为相似和不相似两个子集，根据估计的检测方差来划分。同时在学生-教师架构中加入基于查询-标记的对抗模块，减小两个特征表示之间的领域差异。

Result: 在四个自然图像数据集和两个医疗数据集上的实验显示，TITAN显著优于现有方法。在C2F、C2B、S2C和K2C基准上分别带来了+22.7%、+22.2%、+21.1%和+3.7%的mAP提升。

Conclusion: TITAN方法通过改进伪标签生成和融入对抗机制，有效解决了领域适应问题，展示了优越的性能提升潜力。

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

*Umaima Rahman,Mohammad Yaqub,Dwarikanath Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为DiMPLe的新方法，通过多模态引导学习分离视觉和语言模态中的不变特征和虚假特征，从而增强泛化能力及对分布变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态学习中多仅关注图像特征，忽略了不同模态之间的特征分离，导致对分布外样本（OOD）的表现不足。

Method: DiMPLe通过三个关键目标达成目的：一、不变特征与虚假特征间的互信息最小化；二、对虚假特征的正则化；三、对不变特征的对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，DiMPLe相比现有方法CoOp-OOD在11个多样数据集上的平均表现更优，并在基础类别和新类别的准确率上分别取得了15.27和44.31的绝对改进。

Conclusion: DiMPLe能在保持模态特征一致性的同时，有效分离不变与虚假特征，实现更好的泛化性和对分布变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

TL;DR: 通过引入新的方法TR²C，将高维时间序列视频分割为非重叠的人类动作段，并在5个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的HMS方法大多基于子空间聚类，假设高维视频数据符合子空间联合分布（UoS），但复杂人类动作和杂乱背景的视频往往不满足这一假设。

Method: 提出了一种名为TR²C的新方法，结合结构化表示学习和相似度计算，将视频帧序列分割为动作段。所学习的表示具有时间一致性且符合UoS结构。

Result: 在五个HMS基准数据集上进行了广泛实验，结合不同特征提取器，达到了当前最优效果。

Conclusion: TR²C方法有效改进了HMS任务，能够更好地处理复杂背景和人类动作的视频分割问题。

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在应对自动驾驶及监控等实际场景需求时，分别处理分类增量检测和领域增量检测，但无法同时兼顾，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 引入DuET框架和全新Directional Consistency Loss，允许跨类和域变动条件下的稳定学习，同时通过开发Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI)评估模型的记忆保留和环境适应能力。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series实验中表现优异，分别在RAI提升中实现+13.12%和+11.39%的改进，且Avg RI保持在89.3%和88.57%。

Conclusion: DuET模型无需依赖具体检测器，能有效支持实时增量对象检测，是更具现实价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 针对现有视频虚拟试衣方法存在的时空一致性问题，作者考虑从视频生成的角度入手，重新定义任务以获得更好的结果。

Method: 采用扩散变换器框架，结合全3D时空注意力机制、遮罩策略及多阶段训练，逐步适配为视频服装修复任务，最终结合服装条件确保细节和外观。

Result: 通过定量和定性实验验证，ViTI在时空一致性和服装细节保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViTI提出了一种新颖且有效的建模方式，将视频虚拟试衣任务转变为条件视频修复问题，为未来的研究提供了启示。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效增强了生成图像中文字排版的控制能力，相关数据集与代码将公开以供学术使用。

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Motivation: 现有手术视频生成方法缺乏对手术动作和阶段的理解以及细粒度引导，无法实现基于事实的模拟。

Method: HieraSurg框架中，利用两个扩散模型：第一个模型预测语义分割图反映语义变化，第二个模型利用这些分割图生成融合语义信息的细节丰富视频。多层抽象（手术阶段、动作三元组、全景分割映射）信息被整合。

Conclusion: 提出的方法展示了对细粒度语义的高度遵从，表明其在实际手术应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新设计的两个模块显著提高了基于 MAE 的连续学习性能，有效降低灾难性遗忘风险，并提供公开代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种生成包含人体关键点与传统视觉特征（如字幕、边框）结合的数据集的新方法，用于优化多模态模型在人类姿势和动作认知上的能力。

Conclusion: 结合关键点的数据对增强多模态模型在处理人类中心视觉任务中的能力很有效。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

Conclusion: PanSt3R是一种概念简洁且高效的3D全景分割新方法，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Conclusion: 该工作通过构建数据集和设计新模型，为AI在电影语言理解领域开拓了新方向，并显著推动了性能的提升。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Result: 利用CoPa-SG数据集测试了多种场景图生成模型的性能，并证明新关系类型可应用于增强规划和推理过程。

Conclusion: CoPa-SG为场景图研究提供了高质量的基础数据，并通过新型关系类型提升了场景理解及应用的潜力。

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ToosiCubix 提供了一种通过单目图像和相机内参数高效添加3D注释的方法，大幅降低依赖昂贵设备的需要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D立方体注释方法过于依赖复杂昂贵的相机-LiDAR或立体成像设备，限制了大规模数据收集的可能性。

Method: ToosiCubix 通过单目图像和标准相机参数，仅需约10次用户点击对车辆进行注释，设计了一种几何约束的优化问题，通过坐标下降策略结合PnP和最小二乘求解，并利用概率大小先验处理尺度和维度模糊。

Result: 验证表明该方法在KITTI和Cityscapes3D等数据集上能够低成本生成高质量3D立方体注释。

Conclusion: ToosiCubix 是一种实用且高效的解决方案，适合无需专用设备情况下的大规模3D注释任务。

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Motivation: 现有FS-IAD方法主要利用少量正常样本构建原型，但较少系统性地结合查询图像统计信息，导致原型代表性不足。

Method: 提出FastRef框架，分为两个阶段：通过优化的变换矩阵实现查询特征到原型的特性传递；采用最优传输方法对非高斯分布中采样的特征进行原型对齐以抑制异常。

Result: FastRef被整合至三种竞争性原型方法并在四个基准数据集上进行评估，证明了在1/2/4-shot设置下方法的有效性和计算效率。

Conclusion: FastRef在资源受限情况下提高了异常检测精度，是一种高效的原型精炼解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Conclusion: 该方法以单阶段框架克服了两阶段方法的优化缺陷，通过创新性曲线表示和拓扑优化实现了较高质量的3D重建，展示了良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Motivation: 识别异常有丝分裂困难，但它在肿瘤恶性评估中具有重要意义，因此需要更好的自动化分类方法。

Method: 研究比较了基于深度学习的多种方法，包括线性探测基础模型与基于LoRA进行微调的基础模型，并引入了两个新数据集进行评估。

Result: 最佳方法在AMi-Br数据集的平衡准确率达0.8135，在新数据集AtNorm-Br和AtNorm-MD分别为0.7696和0.7705，LoRA微调模型表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 异常有丝分裂分类虽有挑战，但通过迁移学习与模型微调技术能显著提升分类效果，并提供了公开代码和数据供进一步研究。

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Result: 所提方法在MS-COCO和Flickr30k数据集上实现了无外部数据情况下的同类领先表现。

Conclusion: 集合方法虽有潜力但存在不足，本文方法提供了一种多样性保留和抗坍缩的新视角，并证明了其实用性。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类器无引导算法在使用高引导尺度时容易出现过饱和和不真实伪影现象。本文通过研究发现低频信号中多余信息的积累是问题的主要原因。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于低频信号改进的分类器无引导算法（LF-CFG），包括一种自适应阈值的测量方法，用于定位低频信号中的多余信息，并通过分析前后步骤中的信息变化率确定合理阈值，采用下权重策略减弱其对模型的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，LF-CFG有效缓解了Stable Diffusion-XL、Stable Diffusion 2.1、3.0、3.5以及SiT-XL等扩散模型中的过饱和和不真实伪影问题。

Conclusion: 改进后的算法能够更好地平衡条件与无条件扩散模型的影响，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Motivation: 学习视觉语言模型中的数据层次结构是一个重大挑战，但现有方法未能显式建模蕴含关系的传递性。

Method: 提出RCME框架，显式建模传递性蕴含关系，通过优化概念的部分顺序开发具有层次表现力的视觉语言模型。

Result: 在层次化生物种分类和层次化检索任务中，RCME模型性能优于现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: RCME框架显著提高了视觉语言模型处理层次结构任务的能力，为层次化学习提供了新的可能。

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动态逻辑校准 (DLC) 的新型方法来减少大规模视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉生成，并提升推理阶段的文本与视觉输入的对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无训练解码策略难以动态应对生成过程中的语义漂移，通常效率低下且容易导致细节信息丢失。本文的目标是设计一种能动态调整的解码框架，解决文本生成与视觉输入不符的问题。

Method: 提出了DLC框架，利用CLIP在解码过程中实时评估图像与文本的语义一致性，再基于动态的上下文基线计算候选词的相对视觉优势（RVA），自适应地调整输出概率。此外，通过实时上下文对齐分数的自适应加权机制平衡视觉指导及文本输出质量。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和不同LVLM架构（如LLaVA、InstructBLIP、MiniGPT-4）上进行实验，结果显示DLC显著减少了幻觉生成，同时避免多次前向传播，保持高效的推理性能。

Conclusion: DLC提供了一种高效且无需训练的解码方案，有效缓解了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了其可靠性，适用于更广泛的实际场景。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Conclusion: 结合通用先验与身份适应的策略，GGTalker在泛化性和视觉质量上突破了现有方法的局限性，表现优秀。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G$^{2}$D框架可以有效优化多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提供表现优于目前技术水平的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

Conclusion: StruMamba3D成功解决了现有SSM方法的不足，显著提高了点云表示学习的性能，展示了高效建模3D点结构的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without

Conclusion: 此方法有效克服部分遮挡问题，显著提升了基于单图像的3D重建质量，为未来遮挡场景的研究提供了标准化评估方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

*Alex Costanzino,Pierluigi Zama Ramirez,Luigi Lella,Matteo Ragaglia,Alessandro Oliva,Giuseppe Lisanti,Luigi Di Stefano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SiM3D，这是首个结合多视角和多模态信息用于3D异常检测与分割的基准，注重应对从合成训练数据到实际测试数据的泛化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏关注多视角、多模态信息整合的3D异常检测基准方法，尤其是在制造领域单个实例异常检测以及从合成到真实数据的泛化问题上。

Method: 引入一个多模态多视角数据集，包括高分辨率图像和点云，以及CAD模型，提供人工注释的3D分割GT，并将已有单视角方法适配到多视角3D任务中，使用新指标进行性能评估。

Result: 数据集包含多种设备采集的高质量多视角图像与点云数据，共333个实例和8种对象类型。研究验证了适配后的单视角方法和新指标在任务中的表现。

Conclusion: SiM3D为多视角多模态下的3D异常检测与分割奠定了基础， 数据集和方法提供了可行的基准，并推进了从合成到真实数据的泛化研究。

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

### [114] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架和基准，用于基于大规模表格数据的概率性问题解答，提高了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL系统对事实性问题表现良好，但无法有效处理需要在不确定性下推理的概率性问题。

Method: 通过从表格中构造贝叶斯网络，将自然语言查询转化为概率查询，并利用大型语言模型生成答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基准相比显著提高了性能，展示混合符号-神经推理的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了概率性问题解答的挑战，对未来研究具有借鉴意义。

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [115] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型的多语言能力，提出跨语言功能性基准CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval，发现多语言模型的功能性表现和不同测试基准的收敛性有显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对大语言模型的多语言能力评估主要依赖静态数据基准，难以充分理解其实用表现和鲁棒性，因此需要构建新的功能性基准进行评估。

Method: 通过将现有功能性基准模板从英语翻译为法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语，构建多语言功能性基准CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval。

Result: 研究结果表明，不同静态基准与功能性表现的相关性差异显著，且性能在不同语言间的下降幅度存在明显变化。例如，M-GSM与CL-GSM Symbolic的性能差异在英语、法语和西班牙语中分别为24%、17%和18%；而M-MMLU与CL-IFEval的性能差距仅0.5%到3%。此外，模型在语言间的鲁棒性差异明显，阿拉伯语和英语表现最为稳定。

Conclusion: 传统多语言基准在捕捉功能性表现上具有局限性，新的跨语言功能性基准能更精确评估大语言模型的实际能力和跨语言鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了由大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的研究创意的执行有效性，发现其创意在实施后的得分显著下降，甚至低于人类专家的创意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs生成的科学研究创意是否能够在被执行后产生更优的研究成果，从而检验其真实的科研潜力。

Method: 随机分配43位研究专家执行由LLMs生成或人类专家撰写的创意，执行完成后撰写并提交4页短文，然后由专家盲审评价成果。

Result: LLMs生成的创意在实施后的得分在多项指标上显著下降，并在部分指标上被人类创意超越，揭示了LLMs生成创意的实效性不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在生成真正有效的研究创意方面存在局限，研究创意评价须考虑其执行后的结果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MultiFinRAG框架，以解决财务文件问答中跨模态推理带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM和RAG管线在处理财务文件中的跨模态推理时，由于Token限制、布局丢失和上下文碎片化面临困难，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: MultiFinRAG采用多模态抽取和索引方法，结合轻量化量化LLM进行数据处理和上下文检索，同时动态调整推理策略以提高跨模态推理性能。

Result: MultiFinRAG在涉及复杂财务QA任务的准确性上相比免费版ChatGPT-4o提高了19个百分点，且可在普通硬件上运行。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG框架证明了在有限资源条件下，有效改善跨模态推理的可行性，并提高了处理复杂财务问答任务的效果。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在处理道德复杂的现实场景中的表现，发现它们的暴力倾向因人口统计因素而异，并常与社会科学的已知研究相悖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在道德模棱两可的实际场景中是否能够准确识别和应对暴力内容。

Method: 利用社会科学验证工具VBVQ问卷测量LLMs对日常冲突的反应，同时引入基于种族、年龄和地区的角色设定来观察偏差。六种不同背景的LLMs在零样本设定下被统一测试。

Result: 发现LLMs的文本生成表面倾向与其内在对暴力的偏好存在分歧，且其暴力倾向因人口统计特征有显著差异，并常与社会科学研究发现相矛盾。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理社会道德冲突场景时表现出显著的偏差，需谨慎用于解决线上暴力内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将自动事实核查系统应用于医学领域的可能性和挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学决策的高风险性和庞杂文献的评估困难，使得自动事实核查成为需求。然而，医学术语的专业性与用户医学素养的不足之间的矛盾，限制了该技术的普及应用。

Method: 作者通过研究临床专家如何将医学证据与社交媒体中的实际声明联系起来，揭示了事实核查在医学领域的基本挑战。

Result: 研究发现，医学事实核查的主要难点在于：将“野生”声明与科学证据（如临床试验）联系起来的困难、不充分定义的声明引发的歧义和意图错配、以及主观的真实性标签问题。

Conclusion: 医学领域的事实核查应被视为一个交互式沟通问题，而非简单的端到端过程，因此需要开发新的评估和应用方法。

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望改进现有LM在适应特定任务中的效率和鲁棒性问题，克服小数据集过拟合及未充分利用无标签数据等挑战。

Method: 提出了任务相关知识抽取技术、参数高效的微调方法、改进的监督微调技术，并设计了新的评估方法和基准。

Result: 这些方法显著提高了LM的鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力，经实验证明广泛适用于多种NLP任务。

Conclusion: 本研究为开发更高效、鲁棒的LM迈出了重要一步，向人工通用智能目标更进一步。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

Motivation: 当前多语言大模型的训练面临高质量、多样化数据收集的挑战，尤其是难以为多语言定制过滤和去重流程。

Method: 提出自动适配不同语言的数据集生成管道，设计了一种新的评估任务选择流程，优化了数据平衡策略，并扩展到处理超过1000种语言的数据。

Result: 实验表明，新生成的数据集能创建比之前更高性能的多语言模型，同时提供了新的数据重平衡方法来进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: FineWeb2成为一个高容量、高质量的多语言数据集，并为多语言大模型开发提供了更优的支持。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B

*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种方法，使语言模型（LM）的梯度更新能够模拟基于提示的推理效果，同时无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过修改语言模型的训练方式，使微调（fine-tuning）的效果接近基于提示（prompting）的效果。

Method: 利用基于梯度的元学习技术，通过模型自身的提示预测作为目标，而非依赖真实标签进行训练。

Result: 通过单次梯度更新恢复部分甚至全部的基于提示的模型性能，特别是在“逆转诅咒”任务及文本问题上表现出改进。

Conclusion: 适当的初始化条件下，梯度下降具有超出预期的表达能力，为长文本建模和梯度学习的泛化能力提供新的研究方向。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于块的自动流利度评估方法，融合多种自监督学习模型，显著提高在不同数据集上的评估表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动流利度评估在捕捉非母语者的语音节奏、停顿和不流利现象方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 引入基于块的分析方法，通过Silero语音活动检测对语音进行分块，并融合多种SSL模型生成的嵌入特征。使用CNN-BiLSTM框架建模局部及长期依赖关系，并加入块级流利性标记。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上，评价方法的F1和Pearson相关性分数均显著高于单一SSL模型和其他基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于块的多SSL融合方法能有效评估流利度，但需进一步验证其对不规则韵律方言的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: 本研究改进现有语言模型的个性表现方法，从粗粒度的OCEAN模型扩展到16PF模型，同时引入特定属性控制框架（SAC），实现个性强度的动态调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前研究中，以OCEAN模型为基础的个性建模方法过于粗糙，且缺乏对个性特质强度的控制。

Method: 扩展Machine Personality Inventory（MPI）方法，将16种人格特质纳入，同时使用形容词语义锚定和行为问题框架，动态调整特质强度，并引入连续光谱化的强度调节方式。

Result: 实验表明，与二进制特质切换相比，特质强度的连续光谱化显著增强了人格表现的稳定性和可控性，并且特质强度变化能够系统性地影响相关特质。

Conclusion: 本研究为实现具有细腻和可控个性的人机交互提供了新途径，推动了类人社交机器的发展，对医疗、教育及面试等领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

### [127] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型半监督统一框架(SSUF)，通过多模块增强统一处理查询分类任务，并显示出显著优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商查询分类方法存在信息不足、依赖点击后行为构造训练样本且缺乏统一框架的问题，导致效率低下。

Method: 设计了SSUF框架，包括知识增强模块（提升查询表示）、标签增强模块（利用标签语义和半监督信号）以及结构增强模块（基于标签关系增强表示）。

Result: SSUF在离线和在线A/B实验中均显著优于最先进模型。

Conclusion: SSUF通过多模块增强有效解决了查询分类任务中的多项问题，为电商场景提供了高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 提出了用于多目标、多轮对话立场检测的MT2-CSD数据集及其更优的LLM-CRAN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法局限于单实例建模，无法适应社交媒体中的多方对话场景，而缺乏真实互动数据集进一步制约了对话立场检测的研究进展。

Method: 设计了包含24,457个标注实例的MT2-CSD数据集，以及结合大语言模型推理能力的对话关系注意力网络模型LLM-CRAN。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-CRAN在新数据集上的性能明显优于现有基准模型。

Conclusion: MT2-CSD数据集丰富了对话立场检测领域，LLM-CRAN验证了其有效性，并提供对多目标对话场景立场检测的新解决思路。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态句子表示学习方法DALR，通过双层对齐学习解决跨模态错位偏差和内模态语义分歧问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在粗粒度对齐中表现有限，跨模态错位和内模态语义差异影响表示质量。

Method: 通过一致性学习模块进行细粒度跨模态对齐，结合排序蒸馏与全局内模态对齐学习提升句子表示质量。

Result: 实验表明DALR在语义文本相似性和传递任务中明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALR有效解决了现有多模态表示学习的关键挑战，实现更优句子表示效果。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: 在三个工业CQA数据集上，ComRAG在向量相似度、延迟和存储增长率三个指标上超越所有基线方法，分别提升了25.9%、减少8.7%-23.3%和降低20.23%-2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG通过整合知识与动态记忆机制有效提升了CQA系统的实时性能和效率，适合工业部署。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

Motivation: 传统的微调方法在处理越来越大的模型时存在资源分配不均的问题，提高资源使用效率是这一研究的核心动机。

Method: 提出了Progtuning框架，该方法基于Transformer块的贡献逐步减少更新的块数量，从而实现了更高效的资源分配和参数更新。

Result: Progtuning减少了约25%的参数更新量，同时在多个适配场景中展现了卓越的性能，且具备高适应性。

Conclusion: Progtuning是一种创新的微调方法，将逐步学习与参数高效微调方法结合，优化了资源利用并维持了强劲的模型表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Cosmos的新方法，通过压缩的潜在空间应用扩散模型进行文本生成，突破了现有自回归语言模型的生成局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归语言模型受限于序列生成的本质问题（如解码速度慢和全局一致性难以维持），扩散模型虽然具有并行生成和灵活控制的潜力，但受限于高维度的token级表示。

Method: 设计了一种基于压缩平滑潜在空间的扩散模型，用于文本生成。通过联合训练自编码器实现token级重构及与预训练语言编码器的语义对齐，从而确保语义稳定性，并利用扰动增强生成效果。

Result: 实验表明，在保持生成质量的同时，可将文本表示压缩8倍。此外，增加潜在序列长度后，Cosmos的性能优于扩散和自回归基础模型。同时在多种生成任务（如故事生成、问题生成、摘要和去毒化）中展现出卓越表现，生成质量优于或相当于基线模型，推理速度快2倍以上。

Conclusion: Cosmos以创新的扩散模型引入了高效文本生成方法，展现出在生成质量和效率上的显著优势，具有重要的研究意义。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过语法相似性检索提示策略（syntactic retrieval prompting）提升自动术语抽取（ATE）性能的大型语言模型（LLM）的潜力，结果表明该方法在术语边界识别方面效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了探索大型语言模型在自动术语抽取（ATE）任务中的潜力，以及通过语法相似性提示是否能提升其性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于语法相似性而非语义相似性的检索提示策略（syntactic retrieval prompting），用于从少量样例中选择演示例子，以提供更可靠的术语边界识别指导。

Result: 该方法在三种专业ATE基准数据集上均表现出F1分数的提升，并表明语法线索对于术语抽取任务适应LLM的重要性。

Conclusion: 语法相似性检索方法在领域内和跨领域设置中均提升了术语抽取表现，突出了语法线索在提升LLM术语抽取任务中的重要角色。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态代理由于缺乏外部反馈，无法进行自我纠正和泛化，急需构建针对代理的奖励基准以提升其表现。

Method: 提出Agent-RewardBench，通过三个主要特性——多维度场景评估、步骤级奖励评估以及适当的难度与高质量数据，全面评估代理的奖励建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，即便是最先进的多模态模型其奖励建模能力仍有限，证明在该领域需要进一步的专门训练。

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench为评估和改进多模态代理的奖励建模体系提供了一个新的框架和工具，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at
github.

TL;DR: 本文探讨大语言模型生成的虚假文本以及其检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的不断发展，其生成的虚假文本越来越真实，研究是否有可能通过较简单的分类器仍然检测这些文本具有意义。

Method: 使用统计分类器分析经典侦探小说风格的虚假文本，比较不同版本模型的生成能力。

Result: 在对比中发现，Gemini模型在版本升级后生成虚假文本能力增强，而GPT模型则没有显著变化。

Conclusion: 尽管模型规模越来越大，但有效检测虚假文本仍是可能的，而新的模型架构可能提升其欺骗性。

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢思维LLMs的推理能力局限于生成批判性意见和优化先前解决方案，为解决这一约束，提出一种能促进自我批判和迭代优化的框架。

Method: 利用精心设计的1,730个自我批评实例微调LLMs，通过框架实现输出的自我批评和多次迭代优化，直至在自我生成批评中的评估结果为正确。

Result: 在推理基准测试中验证了其有效性，特别是在AIME基准测试中的通过率从4.4%提升至18.2%。

Conclusion: Double-Checker显示出使LLMs成为更可靠有效工具的潜力，代表了迈向结构化自我批评发展的有前景方向。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Motivation: 在自然语言处理任务中，大语言模型受益于外部上下文，但当上下文缺乏信息时，模型容易出现猜测性或与事实不符的响应。本研究旨在确保生成的内容基于上下文，提升一致性和可信度。

Method: 利用轻量级的任务专用编码器模型（如RoBERTa和NomicBERT），通过在精选数据集上微调来检测查询是否基于上下文，从而避免耗时的LLM生成过程。

Result: 微调后的轻量级模型在准确性上与最先进的大型语言模型（如Llama3 8B和GPT4o）相当，但推理延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: 通过结合轻量编码器和合理的检测策略，可以有效减少大语言模型的计算成本，同时保证回答的可信度。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索了使用仅基于文本的自回归语言模型从视觉语境对话中提取指称表达的可能性，并发现即使使用适中的语言模型，仅靠语言背景也可以在某种程度上有效完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在视觉语境对话中，通过仅依赖语言上下文检测带有视觉参照物的指称表达的可能性和效果。

Method: 通过对一个预训练的大型语言模型进行适配、使用小型数据集和参数高效的微调，利用下一词预测的方式，在对话中标注提及片段的边界。

Result: 结果表明，即使是中等规模的语言模型与小型数据集的结合，基于语言的单模态方法可以在一定程度上有效识别指称表达。

Conclusion: 尽管语言上下文对任务有重要作用，但作者认为该任务本质上是多模态性质，仅靠单模态方法仍有局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

### [142] [Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384)
*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Omni-RAG的新框架，旨在提升RAG系统在处理复杂和嘈杂用户查询时的鲁棒性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在面对现实世界中嘈杂、含混和多意图的用户查询时表现不佳，需要更强的鲁棒性来满足实际应用需求。

Method: Omni-RAG框架包括三个关键模块：(1) 深度查询理解与分解，使用LLM定制提示清除噪声并结构化分解多意图查询；(2) 意图感知的知识检索，从语料库中为每个子查询检索信息并聚合结果；(3) 重排序与生成，使用重排器优化文档选择，最终通过LLM生成响应。

Result: Omni-RAG在复杂、嘈杂的查询情况下表现出强大的能力，能够显著改善RAG系统的实际应用效果。

Conclusion: Omni-RAG通过显著提升RAG系统的鲁棒性和处理复杂查询的能力，为实际应用场景（如SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge）提供了强有力的支持。

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [143] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 該研究提出了結合預訓練大型語言模型(LLM)與結構化、特定任務洞見的框架，用於欺詐和概念漂移(CD)的檢測，並且在多回合對話數據集SEConvo上證明了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隨著語言模式和概念漂移（CD）的演變，揭露欺詐性的對話越發困難，傳統方法及LLM在上下文的歧義性和高風險場景下表現有限，因此需要提出更有效且可靠的解決方案。

Method: 作者提出了一種基於領域知識（DK）增強的LLM框架，分為三個組件：DK-LLM模塊檢測欺詐；漂移檢測單元(OCDD)判定語義漂移；再由另一DK-LLM模塊分類漂移性質。

Result: 在假評論數據集上的驗證顯示領域知識的價值，並在SEConvo數據集上以LLaMA為基礎的實現達到98%的分類準確率，明顯優於零樣本（zero-shot）基線。

Conclusion: 結合領域知識和漂移意識的框架在高風險的NLP應用中顯著提升了性能、可解釋性和穩健性，為欺詐對話檢測提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文评估了大型语言模型在多语言环境下执行Text2Cypher任务的表现，结果显示其性能在英语最好，西班牙语次之，土耳其语最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对语言模型的研究主要集中在英语环境，缺乏对其他语言的深入研究，因此作者希望通过多语言测试集和跨语言比较来填补这一空缺。

Method: 通过创建多语言测试集（将英文问题翻译为西班牙语和土耳其语，同时保留Cypher查询）进行公平的跨语言比较，并用统一的提示和指标对多种预训练模型进行评估。

Result: 评估显示，语言模型在英语性能最佳，西班牙语次之，土耳其语最差。任务提示的翻译对评估指标的影响微乎其微。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在多语言查询生成中的语言差异问题，强调需要更具包容性的评估与开发。未来的工作计划包括多语言下的架构本地化及微调。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过用户交互提升实时语音对话模型的表现，应用于多轮语音对话，整合语言内容和时间上下文的调整，显著提升对话的准确性、安全性和上下文适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的偏好学习方法主要针对文本语言模型，对语音交互的复杂性支持有限。实时语音会话具有更多动态特征（如打断、插话）和对话无明确分段的特性，迫切需要新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含超过15万组偏好配对的多轮语音对话数据集，通过AI反馈进行标注；使用离线对齐方法微调全双工自回归语音转语音模型；结合实验和人类评估，测试了优化的模型。

Result: 实验证明，对常规语音对话的反馈显著提升了模型在事实性、安全性和上下文对齐程度上的表现。优化后的模型在超越单轮对话交互的场景中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 平衡多种动态特性对自然的实时语音对话系统至关重要，该框架进一步表明了实现这种平衡的重要性。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [146] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种修改transformer架构的新方法，通过在特定层加入TopK激活函数，使模型的隐藏状态等同于TopK稀疏自动编码器的潜在特征，从而提高了语言模型的可解释性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏自动编码器存在后处理训练引发的概念探测失效问题，且训练条件和架构选择对特征学习的影响会阻碍分析语言模型学习过程中概念的形成。

Method: 将TopK激活函数直接集成到transformer架构的特定层，移除传统SAE的后处理训练步骤，让模型的隐藏状态成为直接可解释的潜在特征。

Result: 实验表明，基于TopK激活的语言模型在无需后处理训练的情况下，仍保持原本的能力，同时获得更稳定的特征表示，支持针对特定神经元的干预，促进跨层和检查点的神经元特性分析。

Conclusion: 引入TopK激活的语言模型实现了较优的体积、效率与可解释性平衡，为未来模型的可解释性和可控性研究提供了稳定且可靠的工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探索强化学习方法在不同训练状态下如何优化大型语言模型的性能。

Method: 采用可验证数学与不可验证任务的数据集，通过在线和半在线直接偏好优化、群体奖励策略优化目标进行对比实验。

Result: 发现在线和半在线优化方法表现和收敛情况相似，且显著优于离线方法。此外，多任务学习可以提升两种任务类型的性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在语言模型微调中表现出色，且多任务学习能进一步改进性能，为未来的实验设计提供指导。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过利用对话未来发展的信号，优化交互式大语言模型（LLMs）的用户参与度，采用用户模拟器与改进的蒙特卡罗树搜索（i×MCTS）收集交互数据并优化模型实现了更高用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在优化知识推理或对话行为规划方面有所进展，但无法直接保证用户在以社交为驱动的对话中的参与度，需进一步探索用户参与度提升的方法。

Method: 开发用户模拟器，利用改进的蒙特卡罗树搜索（i×MCTS）与交互式LLMs进行交互，生成高低质量经验对，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）使模型倾向于高用户参与度的交互。

Result: 在情感支持对话和劝说型对话两个场景中，方法有效提升了交互式LLMs的用户参与度。

Conclusion: 通过结合未来对话发展的用户反应信号，提出的优化方法显著改善了社会化驱动对话中的用户参与度，验证了其在不同场景下的效果。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）能力的正式框架，探讨基准测试是否真正能反映模型理解力，并展示了LLMs中普遍存在的“伪理解”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数LLMs的评估依赖于基准数据集，但其测试是否能够反映模型能力尚未明确。研究动机在于探讨模型是否能真正理解概念，还是仅仅展示出了表面理解。

Method: 提出了两个量化伪理解的程序：一个使用专门设计的跨三大领域的基准测试，另一个是通用方法，用于评估伪理解的最低界限。

Result: 结果表明，伪理解在模型、任务和领域中普遍存在，并揭示了模型概念表征的深层内在不一致性。

Conclusion: 通过研究发现，现有基准测试可能无法准确衡量LLMs的真正理解力，模型的表现可能仅是表现出表面上的错误理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种注重训练数据组织的新范式DELT，包括数据评分、选择和排序三个模块，并通过实验验证了其在语言模型训练中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关注数据效率的研究主要集中在通过数据筛选、抽样等手段减少训练数据量，而数据组织优化(Data Efficacy)方面的探索相对较少，因此提出了新的训练范式以提升数据使用效率。

Method: 提出了DELT范式，包括数据评分(Learnability-Quality Scoring，LQS)，数据选择，以及数据排序(Folding Ordering)，分别从数据学习性与质量，以及缓解遗忘和分布偏差的角度优化训练数据的使用。

Result: 实验表明，DELT框架下的不同实例可以在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下提高语言模型性能，且LQS结合Folding排序的组合效果最优。此外，数据效率与数据组织优化可协同发挥作用。

Conclusion: 数据组织优化(Data Efficacy)是语言模型训练中的一个潜在重要方向，未来可以结合数据效率进一步深入研究。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Method: 会议组织了全球AI科学家，采用纵深防御模型，将AI安全研究分为三大领域：开发阶段的可信度挑战、风险评估挑战以及部署后的监控和干预挑战。

Result: 报告整合了AI安全的主要研究方向，并基于2025年新加坡AI科学交流会议和多国政府的合作，为相关研究提供了框架和指导。

Conclusion: 提出了一个基于纵深防御策略的框架，以推动AI安全领域的研究发展，同时加强全球协作。

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM代理的使用增加，多智能体合作任务（如调度、谈判、资源分配等）对隐私保护的需求变得更加迫切。这是因为这些代理常常需要访问需要保密的专有工具和领域数据库。作者提出探索当前LLM是否能够识别并遵守上下文的隐私规则。

Method: 建立了MAGPIE基准，由158个跨越15个领域的高风险场景组成，用于衡量LLM代理对上下文隐私数据的理解能力及多轮对话中保护用户隐私的能力，并使用GPT-4o和Claude-2.7-Sonnet等模型进行评价。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型在隐私数据分类和保护上表现不佳：非敏感数据错分类率分别为25.2%和43.6%；多轮对话中泄露隐私信息的概率分别为59.9%和50.5%；同时，多智能体系统在71%的场景中未能完成任务。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的模型在识别和维护上下文隐私以及确保任务协作性方面能力不足，突显了需要更先进的隐私保护方法和训练技术。

inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge

few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个框架来模拟语言模型生成建议在社会系统中的长期传播效应，并构建了一个新数据集以评估模型的长期安全意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型对公共政策和医疗等高风险社会决策的影响不断增加，因此需要确保其建议的正面影响，并理解其广泛的社会影响。

Method: 提出了一个概念验证框架，展示模型生成建议在社会系统中的长期传播过程。同时，创建了一个包含100个间接危害场景的数据集，用于测试模型预测看似无害提示可能导致的不利后果的能力。

Result: 研究中的方法在新数据集上提高了20%以上的表现，在现有安全基准上的平均胜率超过70%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为开发更安全的语言模型代理提供了富有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究揭示了当前大型语言模型（LLMs）仅能进行初级因果推理（Level-1），缺乏类人真正因果推理（Level-2）的能力，并提出了一种名为G^2-Reasoner的新方法提升其因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs因果推理能力的局限性，并改进其推理能力以接近人类水准。

Method: 提出一个新的因果问答基准CausalProbe-2024，并设计了G^2-Reasoner方法，它结合了通用知识和目标导向的提示来改进因果推理能力。

Result: LLMs在CausalProbe-2024上的表现显著下降，证明其主要依赖Level-1因果推理。G^2-Reasoner有效提升了LLMs在新颖及反事实场景中的因果推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前的LLMs受限于其Level-1因果推理能力，提出的G^2-Reasoner方法为迈向Level-2因果推理提供了可能路径。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

TL;DR: 本文提出了WAP框架，通过增强LVLMs的环境理解能力，提高了其在复杂场景和长期目标规划任务中的表现，特别是在EB-ALFRED基准测试中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs无法有效处理复杂场景及长期规划任务，缺乏对环境上下文的充分理解，影响其视觉推理和任务执行能力。

Method: 提出了WAP框架，包含视觉外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和句法落地四种认知能力，并通过课程学习仅用原始视觉观察开发与评估模型。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试上，模型任务成功率显著提升，Qwen2.5-VL在常识推理和长远规划上分别提高了60.0和70.0个百分点，并超越了GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet等专有系统。

Conclusion: 通过引入WAP框架，LVLMs获得了显著增强的环境理解和规划能力，为复杂任务的解决提供了有效途径，也验证了开放式增强模型的优越性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Conclusion: IXAII通过结合多种可解释AI方法、提供多种可视化选项和交互功能，为AI解释实践和人机交互提供了一种新颖的视角。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨人工智能在科学发现中的局限性，提出需要弥合三大差距——抽象差距、推理差距和现实差距，并提出一种基于主动推理的AI系统架构，用于推动科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能系统的操作架构、脆弱的推理机制及其与实验现实的脱节严重限制了科学发现的潜力，本研究旨在解决这些根本性问题。

Method: 作者提出了一种主动推理AI系统，包括因果自监督基础模型的研究记忆、具备贝叶斯约束的符号或神经符号规划器、可成长的知识图谱，以及通过高保真模拟器和自动化实验室进行互动以强化内部表征。

Result: 该系统通过内部模型与外部验证的结合，在模拟行动与反馈校准中提升科学发现能力，并通过互动调整模型以适应实验现实的复杂性和不确定性。

Conclusion: 科学发现需要在内部模型的反事实推理与外部验证的交互中进行，同时保留人类判断作为永久性的架构组件，以应对现实反馈的模糊性和不确定性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE是一种解决现实复杂表格理解问题的新方法，通过Neuro-Symbolic Routing和多专家策略显著提升性能并取得了前沿效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在复杂表格理解及WildStruct环境（如结构复杂性、多层次嵌套布局等）下表现有限，需要一种更强大的方法应对结构推理及多模态表格分析。

Method: 提出TableMoE框架，核心为Neuro-Symbolic Routing机制，能预测语义角色并通过Table-to-HTML、JSON及代码等专家动态路由表格元素，并借助包含多行业数据的TableMoE-Align大规模预训练数据集进行优化。

Result: 模型在四个新WildStruct基准测试中表现优异，显著超越现有最先进模型，并通过消融研究验证了各核心组件的重要性。

Conclusion: TableMoE成功整合了神经符号推理和结构专家，对多模态表格数据的理解展现出强大的表现力和解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是探索现有视觉语言模型在空间心理模型构建方面的不足，填补它们在认知映射、视角转换及动态模拟等方面的关键性能差距。

Method: 提出MindCube评测基准，设计三种方法改进模型性能，包括：增加未见中间视图、自然语言推理链和认知地图，并创新组合出“绘制认知地图后推理”的训练策略，同时加入强化学习增加效果。

Result: 采用新方法后，模型准确率提升显著，从37.8%提升到60.8%，加入强化学习后进一步提升到70.7%。

Conclusion: 通过构建和利用内部结构化空间表征并结合灵活的推理过程，这种方法显著提升了视觉语言模型对不可见空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI代理与人类在复杂环境中的无缝协作仍是一个重要的开放问题，需要更高效的研究工具和方法。

Method: 通过在人类游戏数据集上开发‘人类代理’，这些‘代理’可作为评价AH2AC2的廉价、可重复的人类行为仿真模型，同时限定了数据规模以推动高效算法开发。

Result: 基于这套评价方法，提供了Hanabi游戏中基线性能结果，并利用受控环境进行了细致衡量。

Conclusion: 新提出的AH2AC2和‘人类代理’方法为人类与AI的交互评估提供了创新的解决方案，同时公开代码促进社区进一步研究。

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为下一代代理搜索系统的开发和评估提供了坚实基础，并展示了通过提升效率与准确性的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

Motivation: 现有心理咨询AI模型在对话安全、场景处理及硬件部署方面存在缺陷，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 通过两阶段训练（混合蒸馏数据微调和ORPO偏好优化）提升模型能力，并结合量化技术实现低硬件部署需求，同时采用条件RAG设计引入幽默元素并提升对话安全性。

Result: PsyLite在CEval、CPsyCounE和SafeDialBench评估指标上均优于基线模型，特别是在心理咨询专业性和对话安全性上有显著提升，同时实现了低内存运行（仅需5GB）。

Conclusion: PsyLite为在资源有限环境中开展AI心理咨询提供了一种有效的解决方案，在专业性和安全性上表现优秀，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了基于数据集大小特性的自适应联邦学习框架SAFL，分别验证了数据大小及种类对联邦学习性能的影响，并提出了相关结果与改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的联邦学习多注重模型异质性与聚合技术，忽视了数据集大小对训练动态的潜在影响，而本文希望系统性探讨这一影响关系。

Method: 引入Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL)框架，利用13个数据集（7种模态）进行实验分析数据大小特性对联邦学习性能的影响。

Result: 1）联邦学习的最佳数据集样本范围为1000-1500；2）结构化数据（如时间序列、传感器）明显优于非结构化数据（如文本、多模态）；3）超出2000样本的大数据集性能会下降。总平均精度达87.68%，结构化模态最高可达99%以上，同时显著提升通信效率，总通信数据仅7.38GB（558次交互）。

Conclusion: 本文分析了数据大小特性对联邦学习的关键影响，提出高效框架SAFL，在实际应用中具有显著理论价值和实践意义。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial

distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了上下文-内容不确定性原则(CCUP)，用于描述在不确定性条件下注释的熵不对称特性，并建立了基于层次化计算框架的推导操作理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解在不确定条件下如何通过上下文与内容的结构特性减少不确定性，同时为脑功能和机器学习提供统一的理论框架。

Method: 提出了方向性熵最小化模型（内容优先结构化）和四个分层操作原则，从核心约束到空间层次自组织，实现了理论与实验的结合，包括相关等价性定理、依赖性格架和计算模拟。

Result: 表明CCUP对齐的推理方法能够显著提升推理效率，提供脑部与机器推理中不确定性处理的理论支持。

Conclusion: 人脑和机器不仅是推理工具，更是熵梯度解析循环系统，通过内容驱动的模拟对齐结构与特异性，同时最小化不确定性。

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) 和其贪婪变体DTS$^\star$的新方法，用于推导时间内对扩散模型进行目标调整，同时大幅节省计算资源并提高样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对现有扩散模型在推导时间目标调整中的低效性和错误引导问题，作者希望利用过去的计算信息，提高计算效率和样本质量。

Method: 提出了基于树的Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS)，通过传播终端奖赏和迭代更新价值估计，以准确采样目标密度，同时利用过去生成信息增强推导过程。其贪婪变体DTS$^\star$则专注寻找高奖赏样本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等生成任务中，DTS在最多节省10倍计算的情况下达到最佳的FID指标；在文本到图像生成和语言完成任务中，DTS$^\star$在最多节省5倍计算的情况下同样找到高奖励样本。

Conclusion: 新方法DTS及其变体有效优化了推导时间扩散模型的目标调整过程，不仅提高样本质量，还大幅减低计算需求，能够扩展性地持续优化结果。

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

TL;DR: 研究证明了FLIPD在现实假设下的正确性，并探讨了类似于FLIPD的理论拓展。


<details>

Motivation: 填补FLIPD理论依据的不完整性，特别是在更现实的背景下验证其正确性。

Method: 通过数学证明形式，从理论上验证FLIPD的方法，并讨论使用不同卷积类型的类似方法的效果。

Result: 完善了FLIPD的理论基础，证明了其设计在更通用假设下的正确性，同时提出一种替代的卷积操作（均匀卷积）的理论适用性。

Conclusion: FLIPD在估计局部内在维度方面是有效的，并可在更广泛的假设下推广应用。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

Motivation: 研究微调过程中学习到的关系信息如何被存储并用于预测，以及模型不同层次如何协同作用来支持信息处理。

Method: 提出动态权重嫁接技术，用于分析预训练和微调语言模型中信息的提取和回忆路径及其在不同层次的作用。

Result: 发现微调后模型在处理实体时提取关系信息，并在预测阶段晚些时候通过注意力机制和前馈网络回忆这些信息。这些路径有时需协同作用，有时单独足够。

Conclusion: 语言模型在微调中通过双路径整合和利用学习信息，动态权重嫁接技术为深入理解其机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

Conclusion: 尽管MX格式引入了计算效率提升，但存在不稳定风险。通过精度动态调整技术，可以缓解或避免这些问题，从而实现与全精度相当的性能表现。

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Result: 数值结果表明，联合训练可以发现适当的潜在空间，不仅减少了重构误差，还确保了在潜在空间中扩散模型的良好表现。

Conclusion: 提出的基于潜在条件扩散模型的随机建模框架在数值模拟中显著提高了计算速度，同时保持了与空间物理领域标准扩散模型相当的预测精度。

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: SPD方法拓宽了线性参数分解方法在大规模模型上的应用，为机械化可解释性研究打开了新的可能性，并提供了开源实现库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，为在FPGA上部署资源高效的RNN加速器设计提供了可能性。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Conclusion: 文章提出的检测对抗样本方法是一种普适性强且高效的防御机制，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

Result: 发现LoRA微调显著降低了记忆风险，相较全量微调对模型规模和数据重复的敏感性差异显著，同时保持了较强的任务性能。

Conclusion: LoRA是一种比全量微调更安全有效的方法，可大幅降低记忆化风险，适用于对数据安全有较高要求的任务场景。

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented
capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing complex data. These
powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and

inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

Result: 实验显示该方法在现有常用度量中比最佳现有方法提升2.79%，在新提出的TV度量中提升111.45%。

Conclusion: RWFT方法不仅能有效匹配完全重新训练的效果，还能显著降低数据泄露风险，是现有机器学习遗忘领域中的突破。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Conclusion: 算法确保了有效的覆盖率和次线性遗憾，并通过实验验证了其有效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Conclusion: 本文方法有效突破了单策略复杂性测量中的局限，提出了更普适的理论框架，并在平均奖励离线强化学习领域取得了重要进展。

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Conclusion: DL-LIME既提升了性能，也增强了模型可解释性，可为雷达资源管理中的决策提供更多洞察。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Conclusion: 该框架在操作约束不明确或缺乏时表现优越，适用于新兴过程和改造应用，展示了其在复杂问题中推理和优化的潜力。

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

Motivation: 传统的规则集依赖于手工设计的输入特征，当特征不够准确或独立时，需要更复杂的规则，降低了模型的可解释性。因此，提出更为灵活的规则形式来平衡模型准确性与可解释性。

Method: 通过引入基于稀疏线性变换的逻辑命题（如 $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$），结合一种迭代加权的逻辑回归方法，顺序贪婪优化规则集的学习过程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集中，该方法不仅达到了与先进方法相同的测试风险，还显著降低了模型复杂性。

Conclusion: 引入可学习的稀疏逻辑命题能够提升规则集的表达能力，既保证预测性能又提高了模型简洁性与可解释性。

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MSA是一种低成本且有效的方法，为建立能够进行数据删除的灵活大语言模型提供了可能。

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

Conclusion: AbMEGD在维持抗体结构完整性的同时，提高了功能性，树立了序列结构共设计和亲和力优化的新标杆。

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MoRA的自激活稀疏秩激活方法，解决了现有LoRA-MoE在CL中存在的干扰、冗余和歧义问题，从而提升了CL在预训练模型上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LoRA-MoE在持续学习中的重大遗留问题，如干扰、冗余和路由歧义。

Method: 通过将每个秩分解为多个秩-1的独立组件，并基于中间激活推断其相关性，提出稀疏混合秩激活的方法，并结合秩剪枝和激活预算，优化稀疏选择。

Result: MoRA显著提升了CL在预训练模型上的表现，包括域内学习和域外遗忘/泛化问题。

Conclusion: MoRA显著减轻了遗忘问题，提高了泛化能力，是CL领域在PTMs上的有效改进。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

Motivation: 现实中的数据常以流形式到达，并伴有分布变化，这些变化会导致联邦学习模型性能下降。如何在存在概念漂移的情况下优化模型表现是本文的主要动机。

Method: 使用信息论对概念漂移下的联邦学习性能进行分析。将漂移建模为马尔可夫链，定义并推导模型的“平稳泛化误差”。根据KL散度和互信息的理论基础提出一种正则化算法以增强长期性能。此外，还通过Pareto前沿分析性能与成本的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法可以有效适应联邦学习中的概念漂移情境，实验结果支持理论发现。

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Motivation: 现有大规模数据集中的冗余数据导致训练效率低下，亟需更高效的数据选择方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了ε样本覆盖率(ε-sample cover)的概念，以量化样本冗余，并将数据选择过程重新表述为强化学习问题，通过轻量化的RL代理，基于ε-sample cover动态调整选择策略。

Result: 在基准数据集和多种架构上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，显著提高了训练效率，同时模型的泛化能力也得到了提升。

Conclusion: 利用强化学习结合数据冗余量化指标，可有效减少训练数据的冗余，提高深度学习模型的训练效率和性能，展现了巨大的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Result: 在各种长期基准测试中，SSE在效率和成功率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSE显著提升了长时间跨度的强化学习任务性能，表明结构化的子目标执行和智能路径优化的有效性。

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅提高了技能发现的效率和多样性，还在高维环境中展示了显著优势，验证了其实用性和创新性。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedDAA的动态聚类联邦学习框架，以应对多源概念漂移并保留有价值的历史知识，实验显示模型在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的概念漂移问题尚未充分解决，特别是虚拟漂移和标签漂移时现有方法会导致知识遗忘，因此需要一种新方法来区分漂移来源并采取相应的适配策略。

Method: 设计了FedDAA框架，整合了簇数量确定模块、真实漂移检测模块和概念漂移适配模块，提供了理论收敛性保证，并利用实验验证其有效性。

Result: FedDAA在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上相比于现有方法提升了7.84%到8.52%的准确率。

Conclusion: FedDAA在概念漂移的处理上表现出色，能够有效区分漂移来源并适配，显著改善了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Motivation: 提升LLMs的问题解决能力并扩大其应用范围，尤其在工具使用的理解与意图把握上存在挑战。

Method: 通过从知识图谱提取查询路径，将关系转化为工具可操作的步骤，并生成高质量指令数据，最后使用这些数据对模型进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，即使仅用少量合成数据微调，也能显著提升LLMs的工具使用能力及整体性能。

Conclusion: 利用知识图谱生成高质量指令数据是改善LLMs工具使用能力的一种有效方法。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

Conclusion: CHOOSE展现了在计算资源受限的无线设备中应用轻量Transformer算法的潜力，降低了部署成本，并未牺牲性能。

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: 此研究为公平性增强方法评估提供了标准化工具，有助于联邦学习领域的公平性研究。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Conclusion: 新提案的H-CMR模型不仅在任务预测上有效，还大大改善了概念和训练过程的可解释性，提升了数据使用效率。

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

Motivation: 现有方法在提升Transformer效率时往往仅针对特定模块或独立跳过某些层，未充分利用中层的冗余性和信息聚合特性。

Method: 通过学习的门控机制动态跳过Transformer中间对称层，同时由门控注意力机制阻止后续token关注跳过的token位置，并使用'三明治'归一化控制残差和正则化损失控制稀疏性。

Result: 在模型规模受限的实验中，对于验证交叉熵和计算开销的平衡表现未优于更少层的密集模型基线。

Conclusion: 该方法未在效率-性能权衡中显著改善，但提出的动态跳跃架构具有启发性，可供后续研究探索。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

### [211] [NaLaFormer: Norm-Aware Linear Attention for Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21137)
*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种全新的Norm-Aware线性注意力机制，旨在解决目前线性注意力中的熵降缺陷与点积交互缺失问题，提升表达能力与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力算法在熵降和点积交互方面存在不足，具体表现为忽略了Query范数在熵降中的作用以及禁止负值所导致的内积交互缺失问题。

Method: 首先通过范数和方向将Query和Key分解以实现动态熵降控制和范数一致性。然后设计Query范数感知的核函数，并采用范数保持映射将角度矩阵元素投影为非负值，同时抑制方向相反的维度。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上提升了性能和效率，表现提升达4.2%。

Conclusion: Norm-Aware线性注意力机制不仅解决了熵降问题，还优化了点积交互，增强了模型的表达能力，证明了其在多任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过基于熵的复杂数据进行高效微调的方法，显著提升了训练效果，同时大幅减少了数据使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少模型微调所需的数据量和调用成本，同时维持甚至提升训练效果。

Method: 利用单一答案熵指标将训练数据分类为不同的复杂性类别，对复杂数据使用推理策略，并结合监督微调（SFT）和蒸馏方法优化小型语言模型。

Result: 提出的流程相比传统SFT，在精度上有显著提升（0.55 比 0.43），并且在使用62%更少数据量的情况下，仍能达到与完整蒸馏类似的性能。

Conclusion: 基于熵的复杂性分类和推理策略是一种高效、低资源消耗的微调方式，具有广泛的推广前景和应用价值。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

*Ziwei Wang,Hongbin Wang,Tianwang Jia,Xingyi He,Siyang Li,Dongrui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DBConformer的双分支卷积Transformer网络，用于改进脑电图（EEG）解码，在多种任务中表现出色，且参数量较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流的卷积神经网络（CNNs）在脑电图解码中的短感受野限制了其捕获长时间依赖和全局跨通道关系的能力。虽然混合CNN-Transformer模型部分缓解了这一问题，但其多采用串行设计，导致局部和全局特征的融合效果不佳，且通常忽视了对通道的显式建模。因此，提出新模型的目的是改进这些局限。

Method: 提出了一种双分支卷积Transformer网络（DBConformer），通过时间Conformer捕捉长时间依赖，空间Conformer捕捉通道间的交互。同时引入轻量级通道注意模块，对重要通道分配数据驱动的权重，以提炼空间表示。

Result: 在五个运动想象（MI）数据集和两个癫痫检测数据集上的广泛实验中，DBConformer在三种评估设置中均优于10种基线模型，并显著减少了参数量。此外，DBConformer提取的特征具有生理解释性，与MI任务中的传感运动相关性一致。

Conclusion: DBConformer不仅在性能上优于现有方法，还证明了其在结果解释性上的优势，使其成为可靠且可解释的EEG解码工具。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

Motivation: 现有大模型的分布式训练高度依赖于高速网络，限制了去中心化计算的能力。论文旨在探索如何在慢速网络环境下实现高效分布式训练，解锁去中心化集群的潜力。

Method: 提出DiLoCoX框架，结合管道并行、双优化策略、通信与本地训练的一步延迟重叠、以及自适应梯度压缩机制，同时通过理论分析证明其收敛性和实验证明其大规模模型训练能力。

Conclusion: DiLoCoX成功突破了去中心化分布式训练的限制，是首个能有效训练超过1000亿参数模型的去中心化框架，显著提升了慢速网络上的模型训练效率。

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)的框架，用于生成能逃避入侵检测系统(IDS)的隐匿性对抗攻击，同时利用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)检测此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法难以应对新型威胁，尤其是无法区分隐匿性攻击和OOD事件，因此需要更智能和高效的IDS。

Method: 设计一个多分类IDS分类器，结合cGAN生成隐匿性对抗样本，该样本可伪装为OOD分布。同时采用CVAE，通过负对数似然检测隐匿性扰动。

Result: CVAE基于遗憾分数的方法在检测隐匿性对抗威胁方面显著优于传统基于马氏距离的检测器。

Conclusion: 高阶概率建模对提升IDS抵御基于生成模型的适应性网络入侵能力至关重要。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Motivation: 联邦学习受数据、计算和通信的异质性限制，作者希望通过引入强泛化能力的预训练视觉-语言模型来优化联邦学习效果。

Method: 设计pFedDC框架，每个客户端拥有全球和本地提示，以捕获共享知识及客户端特定语义，通过交叉融合模块整合不同层次的提示，实现个性化表示生成。

Result: pFedDC在九个具有不同异质性的数据集上进行了实验，结果显示性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: pFedDC框架能有效应对异质性挑战，并通过个性化联邦学习优化模型表现。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

*Jiajie Yang*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的专家路由框架：Latent Prototype Routing (LPR)，解决了Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)架构中存在的负载不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MoE系统存在负载不平衡问题，导致模型容量和计算资源未被充分利用。本文通过重新审视专家路由问题，提出了一种更高效、更均衡的解决方法。

Method: 引入Latent Prototype Routing (LPR)框架，从聚类的视角来优化专家路由，提高专家的负载均衡性，同时不影响模型性能。

Result: 在多种开源MoE模型上的实验表明，LPR将专家负载的Gini系数从0.70降低到平均0.035，将最小-最大专家负载比率从1e-6提升至0.70，实现近乎完美的负载平衡。

Conclusion: LPR框架成功地实现了专家负载的均衡，同时保留了下游任务的性能优势，为MoE系统的进一步扩展提供了可能性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性的神经网络压缩方法，通过利用ReLU激活函数的特性实现模型权重的减少，并在实验中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络压缩方法已高度优化，但仍需进一步利用潜在特性来减少模型参数。

Method: 提出基于线性的压缩方法，利用ReLU激活函数几乎总被激活的线性行为特性来实现层合并。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在测试模型中可无损压缩至原模型大小的1/4。并且，与基于重要性方法的模型结合时干扰极小。

Conclusion: 本文奠定了一种新型神经网络压缩方法的基础，使模型更小且更高效，同时与其他方法兼容性良好。

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）存在信息错误和校准不足的问题，需要准确的不确定性量化方法，特别是在高风险领域如自主系统和医疗中。

Method: 提出ScalaBL方法，通过LoRA参数进行低秩的变分子空间推断，将子空间的采样映射到模型的完整权重空间，同时采用随机变分推断学习所有参数。

Result: ScalaBL仅需约1000个额外参数便取得了与现有最新方法相当的性能，还实现了当前规模最大的贝叶斯LLM，比之前的模型多了四倍参数。

Conclusion: ScalaBL方法在保有低维子空间的情况下，成功实现了大规模化，拓展了贝叶斯LLM在不确定性量化场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual

this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: 新方法有望成为新的标准技术，其提出的形式化框架也为理论分析提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

Motivation: 解决当前脑机接口系统对EEG信号复杂性和多样性表现不足的问题。

Method: 开发了一种基于注意力的图时空卷积网络（AGTCNet），结合图卷积注意网络以学习EEG信号的时空特征。

Result: AGTCNet在EEG数据集上的分类精度显著优于现有模型，同时模型更小，推理速度更快。

Conclusion: AGTCNet展示了为更高效和实用的BCI系统部署提供了可能性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV

*Jingyao Li,Hao Sun,Zile Qiao,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Hong Xu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DynamicBench，评估LLMs处理动态实时数据的能力，显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法有效评估LLMs实时信息处理需求，需更动态评测方法。

Method: 设计DynamicBench基准，结合网页搜索与本地报告数据库的双路径检索管道，评估领域知识的应用及动态信息处理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文方法在无文档和文档辅助两个场景分别超过GPT4o 7.0%和5.8%。

Conclusion: DynamicBench有效提升了LLMs对实时信息的处理与分析能力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

### [226] [Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21352)
*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出对上持久Laplacian特征值在插入单个单纯形（如顶点、边或三角形）时的变化进行了严格数学界定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具（如热核签名和光谱神经网络）严重依赖持久Laplacian的特征值变化，但缺乏这些特征值在局部修改数据时的稳定性分析。

Method: 通过推导并证明一个一致的Lipschitz界，表示持久Laplacian特征值变化与所插入单纯形边界的欧几里得范数成正比。

Result: 证明了在插入单一单纯形后，每个特征值最多变化不超过该单纯形边界欧几里得范数的两倍，与过滤尺度和复杂性无关。

Conclusion: 首次为谱拓扑数据分析中的特征值提供了鲁棒性保证，确保在动态数据场景下的稳定性和可靠误差控制。

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

TL;DR: 研究介绍了医学领域多模态语言模型(ICL)的挑战与能力测试，通过SMMILE基准评估当前模型的表现及其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学领域，医生需要从少量实例中学习任务，这凸显了多模态ICL的潜在价值。然而，目前MLLM在多模态任务上的适配能力尚不明确。

Method: 提出了SMMILE和SMMILE++测试集，由医学专家设计并涵盖多种医学任务，通过1138个问题-图像-答案组合和多模型测试，研究其对多模态ICL能力的影响。

Result: 15个MLLM中，多数表现较差，ICL仅比零样本学习提高8%-9.4%。对无关示例敏感，噪声可能使性能降低9.5%，而示例排序的优化可显著提升表现。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在多模态医学任务中存在显著局限，如对噪音敏感及排序偏倚，证明其需进一步优化以满足实际需求。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

Conclusion: rQdia显著提高了基于像素的无模型连续控制任务的表现，甚至超过了基于状态编码的基线模型。

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based
deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these
distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks
respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and
Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured
in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state
encoding baseline.

Motivation: 为了减少微调大规模预训练神经网络所需的内存和计算资源，探索利用权重和梯度关系优化微调过程。

Method: 通过分析梯度和权重间的关系，提出只动态更新小幅度权重的NANOADAM方法，且无需梯度计算、保留大幅度权重以减少遗忘风险，同时允许更高的学习率。

Result: 在多个NLP和视觉任务实验中，NANOADAM方法表现出一致且更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NANOADAM在减少资源消耗的同时实现了更优的微调效果，具有较强的实用性。

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Conclusion: 通过精细化的近似方法，可以在保证模型性能的同时实现显著的能效提升。

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Conclusion: 该方法验证了时序感知和三重注意力机制在图神经网络中的增强作用，可推广至其他时序图异常检测任务。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格模型通过上下文学习表现优异，但推理成本高，特别是在处理大数据集时，因此需要优化推理效率。

Method: 动态评估是否在每层Transformer编码器后停止上下文学习，并采用预训练解码器快速解码嵌入。

Result: 在34个小分类任务中推理速度提高至1.3倍，预测性能几乎不受影响，在5个大分类任务中推理速度提高至2.2倍。

Conclusion: 早停策略是一种有效且实用的方法，可以显著提高表格上下文学习的推理效率。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

Motivation: 当前在复杂计算问题如气象预测和空气动力分析中，平衡算法的精度、稳定性和计算效率仍具有挑战性，特别是对高阶低存储方案。

Method: 提出一种结合GA和RL的自动启发式发现框架，GA用于探索搜索空间，RL用于动态调整启发式选择，以优化ESRK的方法参数，同时减少参数数量并保持四阶精度。

Result: 在多个基准问题（如1D和2D Brusselator系统及稳态Navier-Stokes方程）测试中，最佳启发式方法使IPOPT运行时间减少25%，同时保持数值稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 本文所提出的框架展示了在高保真模拟中提高资源效率的潜力，并拓展了低存储Runge-Kutta方法的适用性，为基于深度强化学习和AutoML的启发式搜索方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

Method: 提出了一种分布式跨通道分层聚合方法（D-CHAG），与任意模型并行策略和视觉Transformer架构兼容，优化图像数据的令牌化和聚合过程。

Result: 在高光谱成像和天气预报任务中实现了高达75%的内存占用减少，效率翻倍，在Frontier超级计算机上使用最多1,024个AMD GPU测试取得显著性能改进。

Conclusion: D-CHAG方法证明了分布式情况下高效处理多通道图像数据的能力，为科学基础模型的性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Motivation: 生成式模型如扩散模型虽然能表达复杂动作分布，但在采样过程中具有高推理成本和训练不稳定性，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出SSCP，设计了一种增强的流匹配目标函数，使得生成策略能够直接从中间流样本预测动作完成矢量，配合脱机政策梯度框架提升效率和表达力。

Conclusion: SSCP是一种多样、表达力强且高效的深度RL与序列决策框架，并在目标导向的RL中展示了进一步的扩展性。

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法拓展了传统故障诊断的能力，可用于支持预测性维护和工业环境中的数字孪生开发，对于提升智能制造领域CPSs的可靠性和效率有重要意义。

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

### [241] [mTSBench: Benchmarking Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Model Selection at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21550)
*Xiaona Zhou,Constantin Brif,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为mTSBench的基准测试，用于多变量时间序列异常检测和无监督模型选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多变量时间序列异常检测方法面临复杂依赖关系、时序动态和稀疏异常标记等挑战，亟需统一评价工具。

Method: 构建了mTSBench基准测试，包含来自19个数据集的344个标记时间序列，测试了24种异常检测方法，并评估了无监督模型选择技术。

Result: 结果表明，没有单一检测器在所有数据集上表现优异，同时发现先进的模型选择方法仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: mTSBench在统一评估环境下推动了适应型异常检测和稳健模型选择的进一步研究。

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible
comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and
robust model selection.

### [242] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究首次在7B大语言模型(LLM)的预训练中验证了grokking现象，并开发了两种评估模型路径特性的新指标，可以有效预测模型在不同任务上的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究揭示grokking现象在大规模预训练中是否仍然存在，以及其泛化能力的内部机制。

Method: 在一个7B大语言模型(OLMoE)中分析预训练中的grokking现象，测量训练损失和在多种基准任务(如数学推理、代码生成等)上的泛化性能，用新指标量化模型路径特性和复杂度。同时探索样本路径从随机到结构化的动态变化规律。

Result: 观察到不同数据输入转向grokking阶段的时间不同，发现样本路径结构化与复杂性下降现象，为泛化能力建立机制性解释。新指标被验证能够高效预测泛化性能，且无需微调或额外测试。

Conclusion: grokking现象确实在大规模模型预训练中存在，其机制包括从记忆向泛化的转化。开发的新指标具有广泛应用价值，既能衡量路径复杂性，又能高效监测模型泛化性能。

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

### [243] [Spiking Neural Networks for SAR Interferometric Phase Unwrapping: A Theoretical Framework for Energy-Efficient Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20782)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量的爆炸式增长（如NISAR任务预计将在两年内生成100PB数据），高能效的数据处理变得至关重要。

Method: 本文设计了针对包裹相位数据的脉冲编码方案，提出了利用相位展开空间传播特性的SNN架构，并进行了计算复杂性和收敛性理论分析。

Result: 验证了SNN的时间动态特性能够自然建模用于相位展开的空间连续性约束，同时具备30-100倍的能效提升，准确性与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: 研究为神经形态计算与SAR干涉技术交叉领域提供了新方向，将有助于实现更可持续的大规模InSAR数据处理。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models
by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher
models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates
low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.
Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer
data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We
introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural
activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model
for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)
Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations
through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects
latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via
supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in
memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene
reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The
results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer
converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in
isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable
for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex
decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely
artificial training.

Conclusion: SQS神经网络模型为开发新一代量子尖峰神经网络提供了潜力，可实现节能高效的时间序列处理和量子计算的大规模特征探索。

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts
presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI
systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs
like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective
evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing
specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm
and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token
efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify
diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing
the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights
task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g.,
instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts
offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their
specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual
tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI
interaction patterns.
