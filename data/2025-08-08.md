### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual是一种基于Retinex理论的创新框架，提出了解决超高清图像修复任务的新方法，展示了在去雨、去模糊、去霾和低光增强四种任务上的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在超高清图像修复中存在固有缺陷：极端降采样会导致信息丢失，而纯频域方法无法解决图像局部退化问题。

Method: 提出RetinexDual框架，包括两个互补子网络：处理反射分量的SAMBA，利用由粗到细的机制减少伪影；以及处理彩色和光照失真的FIA，依靠频域全局上下文进行修正。

Result: RetinexDual在去雨、去模糊、去霾以及低光图像增强四项任务中，在定性和定量上均超越了近期方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual提供了超高清图像修复任务的新范式，验证了SAMBA和FIA的设计合理性及组件有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了用于ENT内窥镜图像分析的ENTRep挑战，包括分类与检索任务及双语支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ENT内窥镜的自动分析受设备与操作可变性、局部细微发现及精细差异限制，现有基准测试少支持分类及检索需求。

Method: 提出ENTRep挑战，包含精细分类、图像到图像检索和双语文本描述，提供专家标注数据集和公开测试基准。

Result: 对公开与私密测试数据集的性能进行评估，并报告优秀团队的结果及讨论。

Conclusion: ENTRep挑战填补了ENT内窥镜分析领域的空白，支持分类与案例检索的重要临床需求。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级框架，通过结合多种预训练Vision Transformers的知识来训练一个简洁的学生网络，实现了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自监督学习方法通常单独预训练，忽视了多方法的互补性，且需要大量计算资源。

Method: CoMAD从三个预训练的ViT-Base教师网络中提取知识，并通过非对称掩码、线性适配器、层归一化和共识门控等技术将其整合到学生网络中。学生使用KL散度在本地及全局结构上进行训练。

Result: CoMAD在ImageNet-1K上实现75.4%的Top-1准确率，比前沿提升0.4%；在ADE20K和MS-COCO数据集的密集预测任务中也刷新了紧凑型SSL蒸馏的表现。

Conclusion: CoMAD框架展示了通过多教师模型的有效融合可以在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RADAR的新方法，用以突破基于重建的异常检测方法的限制，并通过目标关注的扩散模型在实时生成异常地图方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的异常检测方法由于依赖重建过程而存在计算高昂、细节损失和参数选择难度大等问题，亟需一种无需依赖重建的高效异常检测方法。

Method: 提出RADAR方法，省略了重建过程，直接由扩散模型生成异常地图，以此提升检测准确率和计算效率。

Result: 在3D打印材料数据集和MVTec-AD数据集上显著优于现有的扩散模型和其他统计机器学习模型，F1分数分别提升7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR有效避免了基于重建的方法局限，不仅提升检测性能，还实现了更高效率，在实际应用尤其是实时场景中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究利用深度学习方法和事件相机输入定位眼睛中心位置，并通过CNN_LSTM模型达到约81%的准确率，同时提出未来研究方向以提升模型可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于人眼快速运动分析的高成本和复杂性，本研究旨在开发一种低成本且可解释的算法，应用于消费电子产品，尤其是增强VR和AR的用户体验。

Method: 采用事件相机作为输入数据，并利用深度学习中的CNN_LSTM模型预测人眼注意位置，同时提出可通过Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)进一步提升模型表现。

Result: 通过CNN_LSTM模型实验实现了约81%的预测准确率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合事件相机与深度学习方法可有效提高眼动追踪性能，未来通过LRP可以进一步提升模型的可解释性与性能，为消费电子产品优化提供重要的支持。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LuKAN的新模型，基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）和Lucas多项式，用于高效预测3D人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度与计算效率之间难以平衡，本文旨在改进这一问题。

Method: 模型利用离散小波变换编码时间信息，通过关节间空间投影层保持人体结构一致性，核心为包含Lucas多项式的KAN层用于高效函数逼近，最后通过逆小波变换生成时间域内的运动预测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，LuKAN的定量和定性性能优于强基线模型，同时其紧凑的架构和多项式的线性递推确保了计算效率。

Conclusion: LuKAN模型通过创新的时间和空间依赖学习方法，实现了3D运动预测的高性能和高效率。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VER-Bench的新基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉能力，特别是在细粒度视觉线索提取与复杂推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估基本感知能力或宏观推理能力，缺乏对细微视觉信息及深度分析的全面测评，限制了对模型真实视觉理解的评估。

Method: 构建VER-Bench，设计了包含374个问题的评估框架，问题覆盖地理空间、时间、情景、意图、系统状态及符号推理，且每个问题配有视觉线索及相关推理的结构化证据。

Result: VER-Bench揭示了目前模型在细微视觉证据提取及基于证据的推理能力上存在不足，呼吁提升模型在此方面的表现。

Conclusion: 需要加强MLLMs在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合及推理上的能力，以实现真实的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAMM框架，通过多模态查询和双流注意机制提升目标检测性能，针对遮挡、定位精度和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升Transformer目标检测器在遮挡、细粒度定位和计算效率上的性能。

Method: 引入三种查询方式（基于外观的查询、位置查询、多样化随机查询）和双流交叉注意模块，以独立优化语义和空间特征。

Result: 在四个数据集上达到了平均精度（AP）和召回率的最新水平。

Conclusion: 多模态查询自适应和双流注意能有效提升检测精度和效率，并改善复杂场景定位性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种细粒度方法，通过裁剪带有时间戳的仇恨视频数据，分析了时间戳噪声对模型表现的影响，并强调了开发时间感知模型的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态仇恨视频检测方法主要依赖粗粒度的视频级别标注，导致标签噪声和分类效果下降。需要更精确的方法来提高模型的鲁棒性和解释性。

Method: 通过使用HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集中的时间戳标注，对仇恨视频裁剪以提取明确的仇恨片段，随后进行探索性分析并设计对比实验分析时间戳噪声的影响。

Result: 实验表明，时间戳噪声显著改变了模型的决策边界并降低分类置信度，证明仇恨言论表达具有上下文依赖性和时间连续性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态仇恨视频的时间动态特性，强调了开发能够感知时间的模型和基准的必要性，以提高模型鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现有的视频高光检测方法在泛化到所有测试视频时表现不足，因为它们无法适应每个测试视频的独特特性。本文提出了Highlight-TTA，一个在测试时自适应的视频高光检测框架，通过动态调整模型来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有视频高光检测方法固定模型无法适应多样化视频导致性能不佳的问题，提出新方法来提高泛化能力和检测性能。

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，利用一个辅助任务（跨模态预测）与主要的高光检测任务联合优化，并通过元辅助训练方案实现有效测试时适配。

Result: 实验表明，在三个现有高光检测模型和三个基准数据集上，引入Highlight-TTA后性能得到显著提升，且结果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过在测试时动态适配模型，成功提升了视频高光检测的泛化能力与性能，可为未来研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于单目深度估计器（FMDE）的方法，使其能够处理鱼眼图像，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FMDE在面对摄像机校准参数变化（如内参和畸变）时表现欠佳，导致深度估计错误，需解决鱼眼图像的适配问题。

Method: 引入校准标记（Calibration Tokens），调节FMDE的潜在嵌入空间分布，使鱼眼图像的嵌入与透视图像对齐，方法为轻量级自监督学习，通过重新校准透视图像模拟鱼眼图像并确保一致性。

Result: 在室内外实验中，通过单一标记集改进了多种FMDE的性能，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过校准标记轻松适配鱼眼图像，无需重新训练FMDE，有效解决了摄像机校准参数变化引起的深度估计问题。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过解决当前数据集中存在的分类问题，旨在提升人工神经网络的分类性能。

Method: 利用一种新的方法对前馈神经网络进行训练，并分析了数据集中的重复标记问题对模型性能的影响。

Result: 模型使用322,430,160个参数，精度达到4位小数，可平均完美分类285.9个标签，并表现出较高的性能。

Conclusion: 作者推测模型未达到100%准确率的原因可能为数据集中存在重复标记的现象。这标明数据质量对模型性能的影响仍需关注。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ProMIM，一个整合了masked image modeling (MIM)的插件框架，用于增强现有条件式prompt学习方法，提高其在零样本和少样本任务中的广泛适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从零样本和少样本的任务出发，解决现有基于prompt学习方法对已知类别过拟合的问题，同时提高对未知类别的泛化能力。

Method: 通过在可见图像块上应用简单且高效的屏蔽策略，ProMIM生成稳健的、实例条件化的prompts，无需改变现有网络核心架构，并将MIM无缝应用于现有的CoOp和CoCoOp框架之中。

Result: 在零样本和少样本分类任务中，ProMIM显著提升了现有方法的泛化性能，同时引入的计算成本极低。

Conclusion: ProMIM是一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，能够在现有视觉-语言模型中有效提升其性能，适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的弱监督动态场景图生成方法（WS-DSGG）TRKT，通过分类特定注意力图和光流辅助提高检测精度，实现了最新的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用的静态图像训练的检测器在动态且关系感知的场景中表现不佳，导致定位不准和置信度低的问题。

Method: 提出了TRKT方法，包括关系感知知识挖掘和双流融合模块，利用光流生成动态增强的注意力图，并结合外部检测器进行细化，提高目标定位和置信度。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在Action Genome数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT通过引入关系和运动感知的知识挖掘以及双流融合设计，大幅提升了弱监督动态场景图生成的性能，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code

*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdvDINO，一种集成领域对抗机制的自监督学习框架，以解决领域间数据差异对模型的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自监督学习方法在领域迁移背景下的鲁棒性，尤其是在生物医学图像分析中减少批次效应的干扰。

Method: 将梯度反转层（gradient reversal layer）整合到DINOv2架构中，促进领域不变特征的学习。

Result: 模型成功减轻了样本特异性偏差，比非对抗性方法学到了更鲁棒且具有更深生物学意义的图像表示，并且在生存预测中表现更好。

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学图像，还可推广至远程感知、自动驾驶等其它领域，有助于解决领域迁移问题并提升模型解释性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为HOW-Seg的新颖人机互动框架，用于解决开放域点云语义分割，尤其在无需密集标注数据的情况下，实现对基类和新类的高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理开放域点云语义分割时依赖繁重的离线增量学习或密集标注数据，限制了其实用性，亟需一种高效且具有一定人机交互的分割框架。

Method: HOW-Seg通过直接在查询数据上构建类别原型，避免了因类内分布偏移引起的原型偏差；利用稀疏的人类标注指导，结合层次化原型消歧机制以及条件随机场优化标签分配；通过迭代式人机反馈不断优化预测。

Result: HOW-Seg 在仅需稀疏标注（如每类数据点击一次）的情况下，匹配或超过了当前最先进的方法；在采用更高性能模型和更多标注情况下，其在S3DIS和ScanNetv2数据集上的mIoU分别达到了85.27%和66.37%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg框架在开放域点云语义分割中的性能卓越，展示了稀疏标注结合人机交互的巨大潜力，开辟了高效处理复杂场景分割任务的新路径。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

*Zhihao Guo,Peng Wang,Zidong Chen,Xiangyu Kong,Yan Lyu,Guanyu Gao,Liangxiu Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进3D Gaussian Splatting的方法，通过引入学习的不确定性和软区分丢弃正则化来提升稀疏视图场景中的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数3D Gaussian Splatting方法在渲染中对所有高斯点赋予相同的权重，这在稀疏视图场景中容易导致过拟合问题，亟需改进其对高斯点权重分配的适应性。

Method: 方法通过引入学习的不确定性来引导高斯不透明度的微分更新并保持3DGS管道完整性，同时这些不确定性通过软区分丢弃正则化转化为连续丢弃概率，从而优化最终的高斯投影和混合过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在常用数据集上的表现优于现有稀疏视图方法，例如在MipNeRF 360数据集上相比DropGaussian提高了3.27%的PSNR，同时用更少的高斯点达到了更高质量的重建。

Conclusion: 引入学习的不确定性和软区分丢弃正则化，能够在稀疏视图场景下有效缓解过拟合问题，并显著提升渲染质量，是一种有效的3DGS改进方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种改进版的基于画布注意力调度方法，通过可变尺寸的画布框架和可选择的画布帧率提升实时高分辨率目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在资源受限的边缘平台上进行高分辨率目标检测时的延迟要求与计算资源之间的矛盾。

Method: 提出了一种扩展的画布注意力调度方法，允许可变尺寸画布框架，并通过可选择的画布帧率优化性能，对YOLOv11进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有技术相比，该方法获得更高的平均准确率（mAP）和召回率，提升了质量和成本的权衡。

Conclusion: 改进画布注意力调度方法能够在边缘设备上，实现更高效、高质量的目标检测。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

TL;DR: SODEC是一种单步扩散图像压缩模型，能够解决多步采样带来的解码延迟问题和生成式先验过度依赖导致的低保真度问题，同时大幅提升解码速度和率失真感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散式图像压缩中因多步采样导致的解码延迟和生成式先验过度依赖导致的低保真度问题。

Method: 提出SODEC模型，使用预训练的VAE模型生成高信息量的潜变量，用单步解码代替迭代去噪过程，加入保真度引导模块以提升输出的保真度，并设计率退火训练策略在极低比特率下实现有效训练。

Result: 实验表明，SODEC在率失真感知性能方面显著优于现有方法，并将解码速度提升了20倍以上。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步扩散和其他改进技术，实现了压缩性能和解码速度的突破，表明其在图像压缩领域中具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度补全在数据有限和分布外场景中表现较差的挑战。

Method: 利用深度基础模型从RGB图像中提取环境线索，结合无参数的双空间传播方法和可学习的校正模块改进预测深度。

Result: 模型在16个数据集上的分布外测试中表现优异，超过现有方法，并在NYUv2和KITTI上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过深度基础模型和创新传播方法改进深度补全的鲁棒性，展示了在多场景下的优异性能。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Motivation: 解决视觉-语言模型在无监督领域适应中存在的模态间差异问题，即模态间隙导致的目标域性能不佳。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理模态间隙问题，实现高效的模态适应能力，为无监督领域适应提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索早期视觉皮层如何通过快速学习熟悉的上下文，实现对全局图像语境的敏感性，并希望通过神经网络模型验证这些神经生物学发现。

Method: 使用基于Vision Transformer的自编码器，结合快速权重（Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA）技术，模拟快速学习熟悉上下文对自注意力和神经流形的影响。

Result: （1）自编码器自注意力电路的流形变换类似神经回路的熟悉效应。（2）熟悉训练使早期层表征与包含全局上下文信息的高级层对齐。（3）熟悉训练扩展了记忆图像上下文中的自注意力范围。（4）LoRA快速权重显著强化了上述效果。

Conclusion: 熟悉训练能够将全局敏感性引入分层网络的早期层次，表明快速与慢速权重结合的混合结构可作为研究大脑快速全局上下文学习的有效计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Motivation: 为了解决预训练视觉语言模型在遮挡场景下忽略细粒度属性信息的局限性，特别是行人部分遮挡或外观差异细微时的表现不足。

Method: 设计AG-ReID框架，通过两阶段流程：首先生成捕获细微视觉特征的属性伪标签；然后引入融合全局与细粒度属性信息的双重引导机制，提升图像特征提取能力。

Result: AG-ReID在多个广泛使用的Re-ID数据集中达到先进水平，尤其在遮挡和细微属性差异方面取得显著提升，同时在标准Re-ID场景中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID框架有效利用预训练模型的能力，无需额外数据和注释，显著提升了Re-ID任务的性能，对遮挡场景和细粒度属性差异有显著适应性。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种用于视频持续学习（CL）的新方法，称为CRAM，通过存储压缩的视频代码而非原始输入数据，解决了现有方法面临的内存限制问题，展示了其能够在更低的存储需求下取得更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频持续学习因长视频和内存限制面临挑战，研究旨在解决如何在内存有限情况下高效处理和学习从连续视频流中获得的信息。

Method: 提出了一种名为CRAM的持续学习方法，通过存储压缩的视频嵌入代替原始视频数据，并引入一种刷新机制来应对视频编码中的遗忘问题。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700的大规模基准测试中，CRAM存储了数千个长视频，总容量小于2GB，并显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAM提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过压缩存储和刷新机制，在内存占用小的前提下实现了持续学习的新进展。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Motivation: 利用Vision-Language Models在医学图像任务中的潜力，但需克服领域转变带来的泛化问题。

Method: 提出MCDRL框架，分两步：1）利用CLIP的跨模态能力，通过文本提示识别候选病变区域，构建表征领域特异性变化的混杂字典；2）训练因果干预网络，消除领域特异性变化的影响，同时保留重要的解剖结构信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，MCDRL相较于现有方法在分割精度和领域泛化能力上表现卓越。

Conclusion: MCDRL在处理复杂医学图像领域泛化问题上的有效性和鲁棒性得到了验证。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Method: 构建了一个包括三类典型增强类型（超分辨率、低光增强和去噪）的AI-UGC图像数据集（AU-IQA），并评估了多种现有感知质量评估模型的表现。

Result: 通过对AU-IQA数据集的实验分析，揭示了当前方法在评估AI-UGC感知质量上的能力与局限性。

Conclusion: AU-IQA填补了AI-UGC感知质量评估研究的空白，为改进质量评估方法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Method: 开发了一个弱监督多模态框架，名为skin-SOAP，基于有限的病灶图像和临床文本输入生成结构化SOAP笔记，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Result: 方法在与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro比较中表现优异，并提出了新的评估指标MedConceptEval和Clinical Coherence Score (CCS)。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架实现了自动化临床记笔记的创新，提升了医疗效率，减轻了手动记录带来的负担，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

TL;DR: 引入了一种无训练需求的指标 (SCSSIM)，专门评估生成图像的场景组成结构 (SCS)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像相似性指标在评价图像生成的结构保真度时存在不足，且迫切需要一个能更好评估场景组成的工具。

Method: 提出SCSSIM指标，通过图像的立方体分层分割统计信息，分析场景组成结构（SCS）的保留程度。

Result: 实验表明SCSSIM能够对非结构性失真具有高鲁棒性，并且在结构性失真中表现出单调的减弱趋势。

Conclusion: SCSSIM相比传统指标在结构评估中更具优势，可为生成模型的发展与评估提供新工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HAMoBE框架，利用多层特征并模仿人类感知机制，通过外观、静态体形和动态步态等特征的独立建模与自适应整合，提高视频重识别效果，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的视频ReID方法未充分考虑从查询-库视频对中选取最具判别力的特征。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入HAMoBE框架，包括两级结构：第一级从预训练大模型中提取低级特征，第二级通过专家机制关注长期、短期及时间特征，并使用双输入决策门控网络根据场景调整专家权重。

Result: 在MEVID等基准数据集上，HAMoBE显著提高了排名准确率，例如Rank-1准确率提高了13%。

Conclusion: HAMoBE框架通过多层次建模和动态调整优化匹配过程，为视频ReID提供了高性能和鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

TL;DR: 本文探讨多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂文档中的细粒度细节定位和推理能力，提出了NiM基准和Spot-IT方法来改进这方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂文档中的细节处理能力较少被研究，例如在餐馆菜单中找特定的营养信息或长篇文章中的免责声明。

Method: 提出了NiM基准测试，设计用于评估MLLMs的细粒度文档理解任务，并提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能补丁选择和高斯注意力机制提升细节处理能力。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在细粒度文档理解上有一定能力但仍存在限制，而Spot-IT在精确细节提取上比基线方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: Spot-IT方法有效提升了MLLMs在复杂布局中处理精确细节的能力，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的名为DualMat的双路径扩散框架，用于在复杂光照条件下从单图像估计物理渲染（PBR）材料，获得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在复杂光照条件下，从单图像准确估计PBR材料的问题。

Method: 引入DualMat双路径框架，一个路径利用预训练的RGB潜在空间进行反照率优化，另一个路径在紧凑的潜在空间中专注于金属度和粗糙度估计，并通过特征蒸馏确保两条路径间的输出一致性，同时采用修正流减少推理步骤以提高效率。

Result: 在Objaverse和实际数据上达到了最先进的性能表现，反照率估计提升达28%，金属粗糙度预测误差减少了39%。

Conclusion: DualMat框架在复杂光照条件下表现优秀，显著改善了PBR材料估计的准确性和效率，可无缝集成到图像到3D的流水线中。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS)框架——DecoupleCSS，该方法通过解耦分类检测与分割任务，解决了现有方法中旧类与新类学习干扰的问题，达到了最新的CSS任务性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSS任务中面临的核心挑战是灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法难以平衡旧类记忆和新类学习之间的关系。

Method: 提出了DecoupleCSS框架，通过使用两个阶段的架构：第一阶段利用预训练的文本和图像编码器捕捉分类信息，并生成定位提示；第二阶段采用Segment Anything Model (SAM)生成精确分割掩码，同时共享新旧类的分割知识。

Result: DecoupleCSS在多项具有挑战性的任务中取得了最新的性能水平，实现了更好的保留-适应平衡。

Conclusion: 通过将分类检测任务与分割任务解耦，DecoupleCSS有效解决了CSS任务中的灾难遗忘问题，并显著提高了性能。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 研究动机是解决灰阶图像自动上色问题，应用于颜色修复及动画自动着色任务。该问题具有多解性，因此需要场景语义及表面纹理作为关键线索。

Result: 研究通过探索自动化着色，提供有效的着色方法并进行模型对比分析。

Conclusion: 此方法有望提升图像自动上色的准确性，充分利用场景语义和纹理信息。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FLUX-Makeup的高保真、一致性强和鲁棒的妆容迁移框架，避免了现有方法中依赖辅助组件导致的误差问题，直接通过源-参考图像对实现优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的妆容迁移方法通常依赖复杂的损失函数或面部控制模块，增加了误差。为解决这一问题，作者希望开发无需这些模块且性能更优的方案。

Method: 建立基于FLUX-Kontext的框架，用源图像作为条件输入，设计RefLoRAInjector提取妆容特征，并开发一个新数据生成管道提供高质量的监督数据集。

Result: 实验表明，FLUX-Makeup在多个场景中均表现出色，性能优于现有方法，展现了强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup通过创新设计实现了高效的妆容迁移，消除了对辅助组件的需求，同时提高了效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有PFM预训练中存在潜在偏差，阻碍了下游任务中的泛化能力和透明性。

Method: 开发了一种提示引导的推理框架AdaFusion，利用轻量级注意力机制在不同PFM模型间根据组织表型上下文自适应融合特征。

Result: 在治疗反应预测、肿瘤分级、空间基因表达推断三项任务上，AdaFusion均优于单一PFM，并提供生物语义专长的解释性分析。

Conclusion: AdaFusion框架有效弥合了异构PFMs的差异，提高了模型性能与偏置的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen是一种生成长时间视频的新框架，能从单张图像和姿态序列生成保留身份和动作精确的视频，突破了现有扩散模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有扩散模型在生成长时间视频时的身份漂移问题和时长限制。

Method: PoseGen提出了一种基于LoRA的微调策略，将身份特征嵌入到token级别，同时在channel级别注入姿态信息，并采用视频片段拼接方式解决时长限制问题。

Result: PoseGen在33小时的视频数据集上训练，显著优于现有方法，在身份保真度、姿态准确度以及生成长时间无伪影视频方面表现突出。

Conclusion: PoseGen实现了从单张图像和任意姿态序列生成长时间、连续且身份保持的视频，为视频生成领域提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty）的新方法，用于解决Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL)中的数据隐私和稀少问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FSCIL方法难以在基础类别判别和新类别泛化之间取得平衡，同时增量任务中原始数据的访问受限导致分类边界模糊。

Method: 提出MIAM机制与MPCC策略，分别通过低秩适配器的训练和分类器校准，在基础任务和增量任务中优化分类决策与泛化能力。

Result: 实验在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200数据集上表明，SMP在保持基础类别与新类别平衡的同时达到了先进性能。

Conclusion: SMP提供了一种在有限数据情况下提升FSCIL性能的有效方案，通过优化基础类辨别力和新类的泛化能力，实现性能突破。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AHDMIL的多实例学习框架，通过两步训练过程消除不相关的病理图像补丁，从而实现高效准确的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多实例学习应用于病理图像分类时，面临需要处理高分辨率全幅图像中成千上万的补丁，导致推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包括动态多实例网络（DMIN）和双分支轻量实例筛选网络（DB-LIPN）。利用自蒸馏训练DMIN并生成注意力分数，通过非对称蒸馏使用低分辨率图像的相关性预测并进行高效推理。还设计了基于切比雪夫多项式的Kolmogorov-Arnold（CKA）分类器。

Result: AHDMIL在四个开放数据集上的分类性能和推理速度均优于此前方法。在Camelyon16数据集上，分类精度提高了5.3%，推理速度加快了1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL能够实现更高效、准确的病理图像分类，在大量性能指标上均展现出优势，其代码已公开。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Result: 实验结果表明，方法在多个基准上超越了最先进的RIS与REC方法，并在GRES基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法改进了视觉定位任务的文本与视觉信息对齐能力，对未来研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Motivation: 解决医疗图像分割中数据稀缺、模态间域移（如CT和MRI），以及隐私限制问题。

Method: 利用轻量级的全局强度非线性（GIN）增强模块，在本地训练期间调和模态特定特性，并通过联邦学习实现数据共享。

Result: 在有限数据场景下，FedGIN在MRI测试用例上3D Dice分数提升了12%-18%；在完整数据场景下，实现了接近集中化训练的性能，MRI和CT基线分别有30%和10%的提高。

Conclusion: FedGIN在多模态医疗图像分割中表现出色，能够在隐私限制下进行有效的跨模态泛化，并显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Conclusion: 提出的ASISR方法通过引入旋转等变性，改进了传统方法的几何模式恢复效果，是一种可扩展且有效的框架。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要分别对人类和动物的运动建模，而统一的跨物种方法可以提供统一的表示形式和更好的泛化能力。

Method: X-MoGen采用了两阶段架构，包括条件图变分自编码器学习规范化的T姿态先验，以及基于掩码运动建模的文本驱动运动生成。引入了一个大规模的数据集UniMo4D，涵盖115种物种和119k运动序列，用于训练。

Conclusion: X-MoGen实现了跨物种文本驱动运动生成的统一框架，展示了在不同物种间优良的泛化能力和运动生成质量。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: PhysPatch框架不仅增强了对抗性补丁在多模态大语言模型中的攻击效果与迁移能力，还确保其在真实场景中的实际应用与部署价值。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Conclusion: 提出了一种创新的方法，通过轨迹增强和多轨迹关联解决了多目标跟踪中的关键问题，在长时间关联及遮挡情况下效果显著。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SPA++有效平衡了跨域可迁移性与判别能力，理论和实验均验证了其在领域自适应中的优越性。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内镜图像匹配中因弱纹理效果、大视角变化和数据稀缺导致的泛化和准确性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了EndoMatcher，结合多尺度特征的双分支Vision Transformer，以增强特征提取；引入多域数据集Endo-Mix6，通过渐进多目标训练策略，提升跨域表征能力和学习稳定性。

Result: 在多个零样本测试中表现卓越，相比SOTA方法，在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集的匹配点数上分别提升140.69%和201.43%，并在Gastro-Matching数据集上提高了匹配方向预测准确率9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher成功实现了在未见器官和成像条件下的高效、精准匹配，为机器人辅助手术的3D重建和场景理解提供了更先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Motivation: 随着大规模多模态模型（LMMs）的发展，其视觉令牌冗余带来的计算开销问题亟待解决，现有方法在裁剪策略和框架上仍存在诸多不足。

Method: VFlowOpt引入基于注意力的上下文相关性和图像块信息熵生成重要性图，提出渐进式裁剪模块及令牌回收机制，并利用视觉信息流引导优化裁剪策略的超参数。

Result: 实验表明，VFlowOpt可在裁剪90%视觉令牌的情况下，保持性能不变，同时KV-Cache内存减少89%，推理速度提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt为不同LMM设计了更优的裁剪策略，显著降低了计算开销，同时维持了视觉-语言任务中的优异性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需源领域数据的情况下，有效解决了跨域少样本分割问题，且表现优于现有方法，为相关任务提供了新的研究思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack框架通过引入推理机制改进了视觉语言跟踪性能，并为任务提供了新数据集和基础实现，为该领域提供了可扩展的研究基础。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Conclusion: 证明了微调后的SAM v2.1在处理复杂形状气泡分割的有效性，是解决工业复杂多相流问题的有力工具。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen是首个支持多车辆配置下可控任意视角相机图像生成的方法。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Conclusion: 提出了混合防御、对抗性预训练等未来研究方向，同时指出了现有技术在对抗鲁棒性和零样本能力权衡中的挑战。

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法采用底层优化流程，效率较低且计算成本高，作者希望开发一种更高效的三维特征场构建方法。

Method: 提出了一种自顶向下的流程，基于预训练的高斯进行快速加权融合多视角2D特征，并为提升的特征训练每个高斯的自动编码器。此外，采用自适应稀疏化算法优化高斯特征场，同时合并和删减冗余高斯。

Result: 使用仅5%的高斯数量即可达到与Feature-3DGS相当的三维特征场性能。

Conclusion: CF3方法在保证几何细节的前提下，显著提升了高效性与稀疏性，为三维高斯特征场的构建提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多语言增强方法在低资源语言情况下表现受限，尤其是在文化信息性和语言能力上。这对于满足低资源语言用户的需求显得不够充分。

Method: 提出一种双源策略，通过使用本地网页的替代文本收集文化相关数据，并利用MLLM生成的字幕收集语言相关数据，从而实现文化认知和语言能力的双重目标。

Result: 实验表明，在MELLA数据集上微调后，模型在八种语言上的普遍性能有所提升，同时可生成更丰富的描述内容。

Conclusion: 通过文化知识和语言能力的提升，多模态大语言模型在低资源语言环境下的表现得到了优化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SGDFuse，一种由Segment Anything Model (SAM) 引导的条件扩散模型，用于高保真和语义感知的红外与可见光图像融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的红外与可见光图像融合方法由于场景深层语义理解的不足以及融合过程引入伪影和细节丢失，导致关键目标无法保留，图像质量和任务性能受损。

Method: 论文提出使用SAM生成的高质量语义掩码作为显式先验，通过条件扩散模型优化图像融合过程。框架包括两个阶段：首先进行初步的多模态特征融合，然后使用SAM生成的语义掩码与初步融合图像作为条件，驱动扩散模型的粗到细降噪生成。

Result: 实验表明，SGDFuse在主观、客观评价及其对下游任务的适应性方面达到了最新的技术水平。

Conclusion: SGDFuse提供了一种解决图像融合核心挑战的强有力方法，并展示出卓越的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D LiDAR数据具有捕捉动态环境中复杂物体交互和时空变化的潜力，但由于缺乏高质量的标注和合适的模型架构，其在多模态大语言模型领域中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入B4DL基准，设计了一个规模化的数据生成流水线，并提出了一种能直接处理4D LiDAR与语言结合的MLLM模型。

Result: 提供了一个统一的解决方案，用于动态户外环境中的时空推理，并在具体场景下生成了4D LiDAR视频、数据集和推理结果。

Conclusion: 通过B4DL基准、数据生成流程和新型MLLM模型，为4D LiDAR数据在多模态模型中的应用奠定了基础，实现了动态场景下更加精准的时空推理。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉-语言推理任务中因视觉状态过渡建模能力的限制以及架构分散性导致的视觉轨迹不连贯问题而面临挑战。提出统一的解决方案以改善推理的连贯性和效率。

Method: 提出了一个宏观-微观两级推理范式，通过宏观CoT进行高层任务规划，微观CoT进行子任务执行，同时采用了一种结构化学习范式，将交错图像-文本监督和多任务目标结合，降低计算开销。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为实现可扩展且连贯的多模态推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Motivation: 旨在解决现有基于空间域建模方法的局限性，特别是细微变化和边缘变化难以检测的问题。

Method: 通过离散小波变换将输入图像分解为高频和低频分量，高频分支强调边缘细节，低频分支捕捉全局语义关系，并通过模块融合这两者的特点，增强变化检测。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验显示，提出的 WGDF 方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面优于最先进的方法，有效缓解了边缘模糊问题。

Conclusion: 通过频域与空间域的协同建模，WGDF 在检测细微变化方面具有显著优势，为遥感图像变化检测提供了更加精准的解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法依赖大量标注数据，这种成本和获取难度制约了技术应用的范围。

Method: 提出GUI-RC方法，利用模型多次预测结果的空间一致性构建投票网格来定位，同时通过GUI-RCPO将一致性模式转化为自监督优化奖励进行迭代优化。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了测试时标度和强化学习的潜力，为实现更稳健且省数据的GUI代理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Motivation: 目前通过绘画投射测试（DPT）评估心理状态存在解释繁琐且依赖心理学家经验的问题。

Method: 提出了VS-LLM方法，使PPAT绘画测试实现自动化，通过视觉语义分析和实验环境设计改进对心理状态的评估。

Conclusion: 通过自动化分析PPAT绘画及VS-LLM方法显著改进心理状态评估的效率和准确性，为心理评估研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: 设计了一种鲁棒且高效的小型视觉骨干模型CoCAViT，在保证低延迟的同时显著提升了泛化能力与性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic

advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Textual Inversion（TI）的方法，用于开放词汇物体检测，通过少量样本学习新词或改进现有词汇，同时保持原始VLM能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来大规模预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在物体检测基准测试中表现优秀，但对于特定任务的优化仍需微调，且微调通常损失原始模型的零样本能力。因此提出一种保持原始性能的微调方法是本工作的动机。

Method: 借鉴Textual Inversion方法，作者提出了一种扩展VLM词汇的方法，通过学习新的或改进现有的token，仅利用少量样本即可识别细粒度目标，同时保持模型参数冻结。

Result: 这种方法在各种定量和定性实验中表现出与或优于存在遗忘问题的基线方法的性能，并且支持零样本领域转移。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地实现了个性化的开放词汇物体检测，无需全面微调，从而保留了原模型能力并降低计算需求。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Junyu Zhou,Yuyang Huang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Ziyang Zheng,Nuowen Kan,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为3D Gabor Splatting（3DGabSplat）的方法，以克服传统3D Gaussian Splatting的局限性，并在高效渲染的同时提升视角合成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D Gaussian Splatting由于高斯函数的低通本质，难以捕获高频细节，同时在训练、渲染效率以及内存占用方面存在不足。

Method: 提出基于3D Gabor核的新型3D Gabor-based原语，结合多频率的3D方向响应来表示辐射场，包括高效的CUDA光栅化器与频率自适应机制，以实现高效的新视角渲染及优化。该方法可以无缝整合到现有3DGS框架中。

Result: 3DGabSplat在真实与合成场景中实现了最先进的渲染质量，PSNR较传统3DGS提高了最多1.35 dB，并显著减少了原语数量和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了3D场景视角合成的质量与效率，为提升现有3DGS框架提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

*Kang Liu,Zhuoqi Ma,Zikang Fang,Yunan Li,Kun Xie,Qiguang Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorRG是一种针对胸部X射线报告生成的新框架，旨在通过两阶段训练方法结合患者特定的临床先验知识以改进报告生成的准确性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多忽略患者特定的临床背景（如症状、病史和先前图像），无法有效反映诊断意图和疾病进展。

Method: 提出PriorRG，以两阶段管道进行训练：第一阶段采用先验引导的对比预训练，从临床背景中提取时空特征；第二阶段利用先验信息进行粗到细解码，以增强报告生成模型的诊断聚焦能力和病程追踪能力。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和MIMIC-ABN数据集上的实验表明PriorRG优于当前最新方法，在BLEU-4、F1和BLEU-1等指标上分别提升了3.6%、3.8%和5.9%。

Conclusion: PriorRG框架通过整合患者特定的临床先验信息显著提高了胸部X射线报告生成的临床准确性和流畅度，具有实际临床应用价值。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

### [71] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc是一种创新的跨视图定位方法，通过将查询图像分割为子图并生成多个独立观测值，增强了可靠性和准确性，并显著降低了定位误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大多数跨视图定位方法仅提供单一的相机位姿数据，缺乏符合测量学基本原则的冗余观测，从而难以通过观测数据的互相验证来评估定位可靠性。

Method: Slice-Loc采用两阶段方法。首先，将查询图像切分为子图像，为每个子图像估算3-DoF位姿，形成冗余和独立的观测值；其次，提出几何刚性公式过滤掉错误的位姿，并整合内点生成最终相机位姿，同时通过估计误报数量（NFA）来量化定位的有效性。

Result: Slice-Loc有效地减少了大量定位误差，例如将10米以上的大误差比例降低到3%以下。在DReSS数据集的跨城市测试中，平均定位误差从4.47 m降至1.86 m，平均方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°，超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过消除粗大误差，显著提升了定位精度和可靠性，可在GNSS失效的场景中为智能车辆等提供可靠的自定位方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖于全局图像特征，缺乏对细粒度器官关系的建模能力，难以生成准确的放射学报告。

Method: 提出名为CT-GRAPH的分层图注意网络，将解剖区域结构化为图模型，结合预训练的3D医学特征编码器和大语言模型生成详细的医学报告。

Result: 在胸部CT数据集CT-RATE上评估，该方法在F1得分上比当前最优方法提升了7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH有效结合了解剖知识和先进模型生成方法，大幅提升报告生成的准确性与医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合可变形注意机制的图神经网络（GNN）框架，用于病理图像分析，解决了传统方法难以捕获组织结构空间依赖性的问题，并在四个基准数据集上取得了领先的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前病理学图像分析中，主流的多实例学习方法难以捕获组织结构的空间依赖性。现有的图神经网络虽然可以模拟实例间关系，但通常使用静态图拓扑且忽略了组织切片的物理空间位置信息。此外，传统的注意机制缺乏针对性，无法有效聚焦于结构相关区域。

Method: 该研究提出了一种动态加权有向图的GNN架构，节点通过权重化边缘聚合上下文信息。模型引入了基于补丁实际坐标的可学习空间偏移，从而自适应地关注结构相关区域，同时增强了上下文场景范围并保留空间特异性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（TCGA-COAD、BRACS、胃肠化生分级和肠道ROI分类）上，提出的框架取得了最先进的性能，验证了其捕获复杂空间结构的能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合可变形注意机制的新型GNN架构，本研究显著提高了病理图像的分类性能，为处理全切片图像和重点区域分类提供了更强的工具支持。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在组合一致性与文本-图像对齐方面存在不足，尤其是Masking Generative Transformers的研究缺乏。

Method: 提出了一种名为UNCAGE的方法，利用对比注意力引导，通过注意力图优先解除与个体目标相关的掩码，从而在不增加推理负担的情况下，提升生成效果。

Result: UNCAGE方法在多项基准和指标上实现了性能改进，并在定量和定性评估中均表现出更好的表现。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种高效的文本-图像生成改进方法，不仅提升了组合一致性，还对现有模型提出了具有广泛适用性的增强方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的人脸识别系统易受后门攻击，而现有的防御方法在确保数据效用的情况下难以精确检测和缓解中毒样本。

Method: 使用结合多个先进视觉语言模型的多数投票机制检测中毒样本，并通过校准噪声对这些样本进行修正。

Result: TrueBiometric能够以100%的准确率检测和校正被中毒的图像，同时不影响正常图像的识别准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为缓解人脸识别系统中后门攻击提供了一种更实用、准确且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理对抗伪装技术在变量物理环境中表现不佳，主要因为梯度优化无法解决局部连续性及多角度冲突问题。

Method: 提出了梯度校准策略与梯度去相关化方法；前者通过梯度传播解决不同距离的采样密度差异，后者通过基于损失值的梯度优先化和正交化消解多角度冲突。

Conclusion: 此框架显著提高了物理对抗伪装的稳定性和有效性，展示了在真实环境中设计更稳健系统的必要性。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Slot Attention方法在处理第一帧或者视频非第一帧时，查询向量的初始处理不够精确，影响了对象的精确聚合效果。

Method: 引入了SmoothSA方法，通过在第一帧为冷启动查询向量预热，以及区分第一帧和非第一帧的变换操作，提升了Slot Attention的表现。

Result: 在对象发现、识别及下游任务中进行了实验验证，证明该方法具有更优效果。

Conclusion: SmoothSA方法改进了Slot Attention的迭代和平滑过渡能力，特别是在处理视频和图像对象识别任务时的性能显著提升。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Motivation: 解决现有saliency map无法捕捉复杂跨模态交互的问题，提供更真实的模型解释。

Method: 通过基于博弈论的加权Banzhaf交互指数，对视觉语言编码器的相似性进行分解，并扩展了评价解释的现有指标，使其支持二阶交互解释。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP方法在解释质量上优于一阶归因方法，并成功用于模型比较。

Conclusion: FIxLIP提供了更高质量的模型解释，支持跨模态和模型间比较，为视觉语言模型的理解与优化开辟了新思路。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Result: 在MVTec数据集上单尺度实验中取得最先进的无监督异常检测性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种有效的、具理论依据的全新无监督异常检测框架，为复杂数据的异常检测提供了计算上可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Conclusion: F2PASeg结合了创新数据集与特征融合技术，为手术中的解剖分割提供了一种可靠且实时的解决方案，有望提高垂体手术的安全性与效果。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

*Samuel Räber,Till Aczel,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过有损压缩处理图像来抵御对抗性扰动，并进行了更严格的攻击评估，发现高逼真重构的图像显著提高了攻击难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在探索图像的有损压缩是否能提高对抗性攻击的防御能力，并分析高逼真重构对攻击造成的影响。

Method: 构建了强白盒和自适应攻击，并对多种压缩模式进行了严谨的评估，探讨逼真度与对抗攻击难度的关系。

Result: 高逼真度的重构图像在抵御对抗攻击方面表现出显著的抗性，低逼真度的模型易被攻破，这与梯度屏蔽无关。

Conclusion: 逼真重构图像的分布与自然图像对齐，提供了内在鲁棒性，为未来攻击技术的发展提出了挑战。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新方法SMOL-MapSeg，通过引入按需宣告的知识提示（OND prompting）机制，为历史地图的语义分割提供了明确的模型指导，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图缺乏一致性，传统深度学习模型难以有效处理，因此需要一种创新方法来增强模型对模式和概念的理解能力。

Method: 作者通过在基础模型SAM中引入按需宣告的知识提示机制，并在历史地图上进行微调，以实现用户定义概念和模式的目标。这一方法允许用户在推理时按需指定目标概念和模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，SMOL-MapSeg能精准分割由按需知识定义的类别，并在少样本微调情况下适应新类别，其分割性能优于基于UNet的基线方法。

Conclusion: SMOL-MapSeg引入的按需知识提示机制有效克服了历史地图中一致性不足的问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案，在分割性能和泛化能力上表现出色。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Motivation: 减少工业异常检测中人工干预的需求，提高质量控制效率。

Method: 设计了一个由中央管理代理驱动的多代理协作框架AutoIAD，结合领域知识库，自动完成从原始图像到检测模型训练的全过程。

Result: 通过MVTec AD数据集的测试，AutoIAD在任务完成率和模型性能上显著优于传统框架，同时减少了问题偏差。

Conclusion: Manager中央代理和领域知识库对于高质量异常检测方案的开发至关重要，AutoIAD展示了其在工业应用中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Diff3F框架的无监督手性特征提取方法，用于3D形状分析任务，验证了其在多种下游任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前形状描述子在区分对称部件（如左和右）方面缺乏手性（chirality）意识，而手性信息在形状分析问题中具有广泛存在性，因此有必要开发新方法提取手性特征。

Method: 提出一种无监督手性特征提取管道，利用2D基础模型中的信息提取手性特征，并通过Diff3F框架对形状顶点进行手性标注。

Result: 实验结果表明所提特征在左右分离、形状匹配和部件分割等任务中表现出色，证明了其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过该方法，可以为形状顶点赋予手性信息，在各种下游任务中展现出较大的潜力，填补了当前手性特征提取领域的空白。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI提出了一种结合新视角合成的手-物体重建方法，解决了真实场景中由于视角限制导致的重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体重建方法对物体模板或全可见性假设要求较高，难以适应真实场景。

Method: 提出了一种基于新视角合成扩散模型的手-物体重建框架，结合接触约束实现手与物体对齐，并通过新视角生成正则化未见区域。

Result: MagicHOI显著超越现有方法，利用新视角扩散模型在未见区域的正则化表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 整合新视角合成模型和接触约束，有效提升了多视角受限场景下手-物体重建的准确性。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Motivation: 针对事件相机数据稀疏以及噪声问题，提出能有效提取其潜在边缘和纹理信息的方法。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1. 差异引导遮掩建模，从原始事件数据中重建时间强度差异图；2. 主干固定特征迁移，通过对比学习保持之前学习的事件和图像特征；3. 焦点对比学习，专注高值区域，提升语义判别能力。

Result: 实验表明该框架具备鲁棒性，在物体识别、语义分割、光流估计等任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架可通过全面挖掘事件数据的潜在特征，为各种计算机视觉下游任务提供更强的支持。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的追踪框架，结合丰富的特征表示和更稳健的运动模型，专为拥挤环境下的多目标追踪设计，解决了遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统追踪方法在多行人交互或重叠时会因遮挡而失效，需解决目标特征丢失问题以提升轨迹稳定性。

Method: 利用检测器的回归和分类分支提取特征，引入头部关键点检测模型，并采用结合3D先验的迭代卡尔曼滤波方法改善运动建模。

Result: 能够更准确地应对复杂场景中的遮挡问题，完成运动轨迹。

Conclusion: 该改进方法在外观和运动建模上对当前技术进行了显著提升，适用于多目标追踪的实际需求。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过在输入图像中加入高斯噪声来提高鲁棒性，但常常导致图像质量下降，该研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在特征空间引入噪声并分析主干网络Jacobian的最大奇异值，提出了一种无需修改架构，可适用于全参考和无参考IQA模型的方法，且具有高计算效率。

Result: 与之前的方法相比，推理时间减少了99.5%，认证时间减少了20.6%。实验表明，与主观质量分数的相关性提高了30.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法既保留了图像的视觉质量，又显著提升了IQA模型的鲁棒性和效率，在多种测试基准下取得了优异的实验结果。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Result: 实验验证了Jacobian Criterion在性能保留方面优于其他流行的度量，同时Equivalent Pruning机制有效减少了微调后的性能退化。

Conclusion: Optimal Brain Connection框架在结构化剪枝中表现优异，提供了一种兼顾效率和性能的新方法。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both

merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video

remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research

Motivation: 解决部分标记数据集中由于模糊或缺失标注导致的问题，尤其是在神经科学等易具不完全数据的领域。

Method: 通过两步法处理问题：首先使用GGSM模块模拟标注动作的粒度以定位已知和未知动作区间；其次利用UASA模块基于嵌入相似性为未知动作分配有意义的语义类别。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了针对部分标注数据的动作发现新设定，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性，为复杂动作分割任务提供新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction框架是一种高效、可扩展的数据生成引擎，可用于提升生成式智能的能力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential

*Haijing Liu,Tao Pu,Hefeng Wu,Keze Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的框架DART，用于解决开放词汇多标签识别中精确定位和复杂类别关系建模的难题，提升了识别性能，特别是对未见类别的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言预训练模型在弱监督下细粒度定位和复杂类别关系建模不足的问题，尤其是提升对未见类别的识别能力。

Method: 提出了DART框架，包含两个自适应模块：ARM模块通过自适应优化patch特征并结合WPS损失以实现细粒度定位；ATM模块基于从大型语言模型挖掘的结构化类别关系知识，利用图注意力网络进行关系信息转移。

Result: DART在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中取得了新的最先进性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DART框架通过结合外部语言模型知识和自适应模块，实现了开放词汇多标签识别任务中未见类别的性能提升并设立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

*Shaobin Zhuang,Yiwei Guo,Canmiao Fu,Zhipeng Huang,Zeyue Tian,Ying Zhang,Chen Li,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉符号化器WeTok，通过分组量化和生成解码策略提升了重建能力和压缩率，在多项基准测试中性能超过现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉符号化器在压缩率和重建保真度之间难以平衡，存在性能局限，急需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了两项核心创新：(1)分组无查表量化（GQ），通过对潜在特征进行分组并量化，提升计算效率，并支持可扩展的代码本；(2)生成解码（GD），引入额外噪声变量建模，重建视觉细节显著优化。

Result: 实验表明，WeTok在ImageNet 50k验证集上实现了低至0.12的rFID，显著优于现有方案。此外，其最佳压缩模型在768压缩率下表现优异，超越了压缩率仅为其一半的对比方法。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中表现卓越，达到了当前先进水平，为高压缩率下的视觉符号化提供了新的解决范式。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

### [97] [LLaVA-RE: Binary Image-Text Relevancy Evaluation with Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05602)
*Tao Sun,Oliver Liu,JinJin Li,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的二元图文相关性评价方法LLaVA-RE，验证了其在不同任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态生成AI面临对图文相关性的评估问题，尤其是二元相关性（相关或不相关）是基础但具有挑战性的任务。多模态大语言模型（MLLM）因其处理复杂格式文本能力适合作为评估器。

Method: 提出LLaVA-RE方法，基于LLaVA架构，通过详细任务指令和多模态上下文样本实现二元图文相关性评估。此外，构建了一个涵盖多任务的二元相关性数据集。

Result: 实验结果验证了所提LLaVA-RE框架在二元图文相关性任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE框架展示了通过MLLM进行二元图文相关性评价的潜力，尤其擅长处理复杂文本格式和多种任务场景。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

*Yuhan Zhang,Long Zhuo,Ziyang Chu,Tong Wu,Zhibing Li,Liang Pan,Dahua Lin,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文旨在解决当前3D内容生成质量评估的不足，提出了Hi3DEval框架和Hi3DBench数据集，结合多维度和细化的评估方式实现高效的3D特性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D生成内容的质量评估面临困难，现有方法过于依赖基于图像的指标，且仅限于对象级别，无法全面捕捉空间一致性、材料真实性以及高保真的局部细节。

Method: 论文提出Hi3DEval框架，结合对象和部件级别进行多维度和细粒度的质量分析，并拓展纹理评估维度。提供Hi3DBench数据集支持，包括多类别3D资产和高质量标注，结合视频和预训练的3D特征进行自动评分。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在建模3D特性方面优于现有基于图像的指标，并与人工评估偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval框架提供了一种可扩展替代人为评估的3D内容质量评估方式，显著提升了评估的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

*Henghui Ding,Kaining Ying,Chang Liu,Shuting He,Xudong Jiang,Yu-Gang Jiang,Philip H. S. Torr,Song Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MOSEv2，一个较MOSEv1更为复杂的VOS数据集，包含超过701,976个高质量掩码，模拟了更多现实世界的挑战场景如恶劣天气、低光等。基准测试表明，现有方法在该数据集上的性能显著下降，展示了其在实际复杂环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集中目标物体主要集中于突出的孤立目标，难以推广到更加复杂的实际场景。作者希望通过创建一个更具挑战性的数据集，引导研究者改进VOS方法以适应真实世界环境。

Method: 提出了一个全新的复杂数据集MOSEv2，通过包括更多样化的场景和目标类别（如恶劣天气、夜间环境、伪影等），进行广泛性能测试并揭示现有VOS方法的不足。

Result: 在MOSEv2上，现有的代表性方法表现明显下降，例如SAM2从MOSEv1的76.4%下降到50.9%，凸显了现有方法在高复杂度场景下的局限性。此外，对视频目标跟踪方法的测试也得出了类似结论。

Conclusion: 尽管现有方法在之前的数据集上表现优异，但在更复杂的MOSEv2上普遍表现不佳，表明当前的VOS方法尚未准备好应对真实世界中的复杂情况。这要求进一步研究突破现有技术瓶颈。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAP的新方法，用于将无颜色的3D点云转化为高保真的3D高斯分布，并基于文本指导进行了多视图优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云作为一种广泛使用且易获取的3D表示形式，如何将其转换为高斯化形式（特别是无颜色点云的情境）仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个多视图优化框架，使用深度感知的图像扩散模型生成一致视角外观，并引入表面锚定机制以保证几何精度，同时通过扩散型修补策略处理难以观测的区域。

Result: GAP方法在从简单合成点云到复杂真实世界扫描及大型场景的点到高斯生成任务中进行了评估，表现出良好的效果。

Conclusion: GAP方法实现了将无颜色3D点云高保真地高斯化，解决了点云至高斯生成的挑战，展现了在不同复杂度场景下的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer 是一种生成取消性人脸的框架，提供隐私保护同时保证人脸识别的效用。相比现有方法，其识别准确性和隐私保护能力有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人脸识别技术发展的同时，隐私问题愈发突出，现有的人脸匿名化方法无法满足可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性等生物识别模板保护需求。

Method: 通过结合预训练生成模型的潜空间，利用真实人脸图像的潜码与基于可撤销密钥的合成码混合，并通过多目标损失优化来生成满足所有要求的取消性脸部图像。

Result: FaceAnonyMixer 生成的取消性脸部图像能够直接与现有的人脸识别系统兼容，无需任何修改，在商业API中的表现相比最新方法提高超11%。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer 提供了一种隐私保护性强且识别准确率高的新方法，是人脸识别领域中解决隐私问题的重要进展。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对话转录中，改进语法、标点和可读性主要通过大语言模型完成，但为对话添加说话人属性元数据的后处理研究较少。

Method: 结合音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）与冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量的连接器桥接音频和语言表征，无需特定任务微调模型。

Result: 在说话人特征分析任务中表现具有竞争力，同时保留模块化和速度优势；且LLAMA模型在某些场景下实现了8.8%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 当前方法为对话元数据增强提供了高效解决方案，同时显示了冻模型在说话人特征分析中的潜力。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章提出Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding算法，重视少资源语言的平权，在保持全局压缩率和语言模型性能的前提下，改进了少语言资源的标记长度分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标记算法因基于频率的目标函数，使低资源语言在标记化时呈现出过长、不合逻辑或大量<UNK>标记的问题，从而加剧了不同语言背景使用者之间的不平等。

Method: 提出了Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding方法，在每一步合并操作中，优先改善压缩效果最差的语言，以实现跨语言平等。

Result: 实验表明新方法能在不影响全局压缩率和下游任务语言模型性能的情况下，显著改善跨语言的标记平等性。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE成功体现了语言平等的重要性，为提高少资源语言的标记化效果提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高现有ASR系统的性能，尤其是通过采用半监督学习语音表示和重音检测模块来增强其能力。

Method: 提出了一种联合ASR与重音检测的模型，并通过在有限资源下对LibriSpeech数据集进行微调实验，评估该模型的有效性。

Result: 该模型在重音检测任务中将F1得分提升41%，在ASR任务中WER值降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 证明了预训练语音模型通过保留或重新学习重要的韵律线索(如重音)来提升性能的必要性和价值。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

TL;DR: LLMs在行为一致性方面仍然存在显著的不稳定性，即使是超大规模模型也无法达到预测行为的稳定需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型的性格特征及其行为一致性，尤其是在实际部署中的安全性问题。

Method: 设计了PERSIST框架，结合传统和LLM适配的性格测评方法，在多种情境下测试25+开源模型，对比问题顺序、措辞、设定角色等变量的影响。

Result: （1）即使具备400B+参数的模型也存在显著的响应变化；（2）简单的输入顺序调整会导致性格测量结果变化高达20%；（3）一些被视为稳定行为的干预措施反而增加了变量性；（4）即便调整为LLM适配的工具，测量仍表现出与人类似的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 当前的LLM缺乏行为一致性的稳固基础，基于性格对齐的策略在安全关键领域可能失去有效性。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理大模型在复杂推理和协作决策任务中表现出色，但现有协调方式存在高token消耗和适应性差的问题。

Method: 设计了一个动态上下文路由框架RCR-Router，按代理角色和任务阶段选择语义相关的内存子集，并引入轻量评分策略和共享内存存储机制。

Result: 在HotPotQA、MuSiQue和2WikiMultihop基准上实验表明，RCR-Router可减少多达30%的token使用，同时提升或保持答案质量。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对促进可扩展的多代理大模型系统发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索和量化LLMs在处理语言中微妙标记（如性别、社会阶层或区域背景）时可能引入的偏见。

Method: 通过设计包含100个验证问答对的访谈模拟生成受控语言变化，保持语义等价性，隔离特定语言现象以精确测量偏见。

Result: 研究证明模糊表达的回答平均评分低25.6%，并证实基准能够有效识别模型的偏向。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个检测与衡量AI系统中语言歧视的基础框架，可广泛应用于公平性决策场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉-语言聚类的框架，以应对动作识别评估中的语义歧义问题，证明其能够更好地与人类判断对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的动作识别评估依赖单一的准确匹配，未能充分捕捉动词语义和图像解读的模糊性。

Method: 通过构建动词语义聚类以提供更鲁棒的评估方式，并分析这些聚类如何反映人类对图像动作的不同视角解读。

Result: 在imSitu数据集上的分析表明，每张图片平均可映射到2.8个动词语义聚类，这些聚类反映了图像的不同解释视角；新的评估方法与人类判断结果具有更高的一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于聚类的评估框架能更全面地评估模型性能，并且在动作识别评估中优于传统的准确匹配方法。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多阶段大语言模型框架，以改进从非结构化文本中提取与健康社会决定因素（SDoH）相关的因素在自杀事件中的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何解决数据驱动方法在分析自杀事件中的健康社会决定因素时面临的问题，例如长尾分布、关键压力因子分析和有限的模型可解释性。

Method: 提出了一个多阶段的框架，结合预训练语言模型（BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo）和推理模型（DeepSeek-R1），并通过自动对比和用户试验验证模型性能和解释能力对标注效率的提升。

Result: 新框架在提取SDoH因素以及相关上下文的任务中表现出更高的性能，同时通过小型特定任务模型的微调降低推理成本并实现较好性能，显著提升了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取与自杀相关的SDoH的准确性和透明性，支持早期风险识别和更有效的预防策略开发。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对话情感四元组提取（DiaASQ）的方法，通过分割对话为语义独立的子对话，并使用两步框架提高提取性能，显著降低计算成本，并实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法倾向于在整个对话中学习单词关系，无法有效应对对话中多个语义独立子对话的情况，从而引入了不必要的噪声。

Method: 提出一种基于结构熵最小化的算法划分对话，并通过两步框架（句子级提取和子对话级匹配）完成四元组提取工作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅达到了最先进的性能，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过合理划分对话结构，本文方法有效减少了噪声，显著提升了情感四元组提取的效率与效果。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled

Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种更简单但更有效的方法Align-LoRA，通过单一适配器的优化实现多任务学习的高效泛化，并超越了当前的主流方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多任务学习的背景下，现有方法通常通过多个适配器或头部来捕获任务特定的特征，但作者认为这种复杂设计可能并非必需。

Method: 提出了Align-LoRA，通过在共享适配器空间中显式对齐任务表示来强化泛化能力，同时与高秩单适配器LoRA进行对比分析。

Result: 在实验中，Align-LoRA显著优于当下所有基线，并提供了更简单的模型设计。

Conclusion: 有效的多任务学习依赖于学习鲁棒的共享表示，而非隔离任务特定特征。Align-LoRA验证了这一新假设并为适配LLMs提供了一种高效途径。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

Motivation: 应对多模态虚假信息（文本与图像共同支撑虚假主张）的数量不断增加，现有基于文本的事实验证系统面临挑战。

Method: 设计一种统一框架“MultiCheck”，使用独立的文本和图像编码器结合融合模块捕捉跨模态关系，并通过对比学习目标增强主张和证据对之间的语义对齐。

Conclusion: 实验结果展示了明确的多模态推理的有效性，并证明此方法在复杂现实场景中的可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出BEE-RAG框架，通过平衡上下文熵改进检索增强生成模型（RAG）的性能，解决长上下文信息中的熵增长和注意力稀释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，RAG被广泛用于弥补其内在知识局限。然而，长上下文长度中信息的无序增长（熵）和注意力稀释成为关键问题。

Method: 提出了BEE-RAG框架，基于熵不变原则优化注意力动态，适应不同上下文长度；并开发了零样本推理策略和参数高效的自适应微调机制调整平衡因子。

Result: 多项RAG任务实验验证了BEE-RAG框架的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG在处理长上下文检索问题上取得了稳定的熵水平和性能提升，具有适配不同设定的潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

TL;DR: 该研究发现大语言模型对输入信息位置高度敏感，提出AttnRank框架重新排列输入以优化模型性能，显著提升了多任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现象表明模型在关注输入序列的头尾信息上表现优异，但中间部分关注较弱，这种偏差影响了模型性能。

Method: 引入Attention-Driven Reranking（AttnRank）框架，通过小校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重新排列输入内容，将关键信息对齐至高注意力位置。方法无需训练和额外参数修改。

Result: 实验表明，AttnRank在跨10种不同架构和规模的大模型的多跳问答和少样本上下文学习中的表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过优化输入内容的排列以利用模型的注意力偏好，可以在不修改模型参数的情况下提升其任务表现。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Conclusion: CodeBoost通过仅基于代码片段的后训练，为代码语言模型的优化提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Motivation: 尽管CoT提高了大语言模型的推理能力，但其推理链的可靠性仍是关键问题，尤其是“级联失效”假设下早期错误的被认为最具破坏性。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought（ASCoT）方法，包括适配性验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自我纠错引擎（MSCE），通过权重定位和路径双重纠正解决末阶段的脆弱性问题。

Conclusion: 本文强调了诊断LLM推理失败模式的重要性，主张从统一验证策略转向适应性、脆弱性感知的纠错机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在优化大规模语言模型生成文本的方式，同时克服LCM模型的扩散采样限制。

Method: 提出了SONAR-LLM，一个仅解码的Transformer模型，通过冻结的SONAR解码器采用基于token的交叉熵训练，结合了连续SONAR嵌入和新型混合目标。

Result: SONAR-LLM在从39M到1.3B参数的模型尺寸上均展现出竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM成功结合了LCM的语义抽象和直接基于似然的训练信号，且公开了代码和所有预训练点，有助于未来研究。

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为确定性引导反思抑制（CGRS）的方法，可以有效解决大型推理语言模型（LRLMs）中的“过度思考”问题，从而提高推理效率，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大型推理语言模型中，由于反思行为导致的“过度思考”问题。这些问题会产生冗余推理步骤，浪费算力，降低实际效用。

Method: 提出了一种无模型限制的方法CGRS，当模型对当前回答具有高度自信时，动态抑制触发反思的生成过程，以减少冗余推理步骤；此方法无需重新训练也不改变模型架构，并可直接结合现有生成流程。

Result: 在四个推理基准（AIME24、AMC23、MATH500和GPQA-D）上的实验显示，CGRS在保持精度的同时，将Token使用量平均减少18.5%至41.9%；与最新方法相比，它在长度减少和性能之间取得了最佳平衡。结果在不同架构和规模的模型下均表现出一致性。

Conclusion: CGRS可以显著提升推理效率，减少不必要的生成步骤，同时保持模型的推理准确性，为高效推理提供了实用性解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 探索手语化身添加可调节功能后，如何影响用户的理解、体验及接受度，以改进系统设计。

Method: 通过让德国手语专家用户与可调节和不可调节化身进行交互，分析用户反馈。

Result: 用户偏好可调节功能，但因嘴唇动作、面部表情缺失及其他设计问题，用户体验和理解度未明显改善。情感质量得到较高评价，而实用性较低。

Conclusion: 个性化设计不足以解决问题，手语化身应在初始设计中确保其可理解性，建议改进嘴唇动作、面部动画及交互界面。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现大语言模型因高资源语言训练数据的主导地位而产生文化偏差，特别是在低资源语言语境中。

Method: 提出MyCulture基准，覆盖6个文化领域，以开放式多选题形式评估，并通过多语言提示分析语言偏差。

Result: 评估结果显示，各区域及国际语言模型在文化理解上有显著差异。

Conclusion: 需要文化根植性和语言包容性的基准来支持大语言模型的发展和评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 提供了一个动态、可信的评估方法，有助于更准确地评估LLM能力，并推动可信的评测标准发展。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,

these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human

Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）方法在知识密集型任务中存在直接语义检索的局限性，难以应对复杂的逻辑推理需求，因此需要提出一种更为系统化的知识增强方法。

Method: LAG通过系统性的问题分解和依赖感知推理，将复杂任务分解为由逻辑依赖关系排序的原子子问题，并逐一求解；引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播；最终综合所有子问题的解生成经过验证的结果。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，LAG显著提升了推理的鲁棒性，减少了幻觉现象，同时使问题解决过程更符合人类认知。

Conclusion: LAG通过逻辑推理和系统分解为大语言模型的问题解决能力提供了一种更原则性的方法，是RAG系统的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Method: 通过设计Geo20Q+数据集以及利用多轮推理任务，评估多语言环境下“20问题”游戏中的地理性表现差异。

Result: 发现LLMs在推理过程中对全球北部和西部实体的推断成功率显著高于南部和东部实体；相关性能与数据频率相关但无法完全解释差距。

Conclusion: 揭示现有的LLMs在地理和文化推理中存在的隐性偏见，并展示多轮交互任务对LLMs评估的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Motivation: 现有的LLMs尽管可以处理复杂上下文，但在生成法律文本时可靠性较低，这阻碍了其在法律领域中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出了一种Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding（CoCoLex）策略，通过结合模型生成的分布与直接从上下文复制产生的分布，动态调整生成内容，增强生成的可信度。

Result: 对五个法律基准测试的实验表明，CoCoLex在长文生成任务中优于现有的上下文感知解码方法。

Conclusion: CoCoLex解码策略能够显著提高法律文本生成的可靠性和准确性，为LLMs在法律领域的应用提供了更为实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

Method: 利用符合预测(CP)的频率采样方法，通过多次独立采样并计算预测熵(PE)，从而提供模型不确定性的量化，适用于黑箱环境。

Result: 实验表明，在6个LLMs和4个数据集上，频率基准PE比基于logit的PE更有效区分正确和错误预测，且控制误覆盖率在用户指定风险水平内。

Conclusion: 提出了一种分布无关、模型无关的框架，提高了LLMs在MCQA任务中的可信性和在实际应用的适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言大模型中政治观点是否在不同语言间转移，以及如何进行跨语言、文化和政治对齐。

Method: 使用来自投票建议应用的政治声明，通过提示符评估模型对这些观点的（不）同意。同时，采用直接偏好优化和仅基于英语的数据进行政治倾向对齐。

Result: 研究表明，未经对齐的模型在跨语言政治观点上差异甚微；对齐后，政治观点几乎在所有五种西方语言中统一变化。

Conclusion: 在西方语言语境中，政治观点会在语言间转移，但多语言大模型的显式社会语言学、文化和政治对齐存在挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

*Shaoxiong Zhan,Yanlin Lai,Ziyu Lu,Dahua Lin,Ziqing Yang,Fei Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MathSmith的框架，通过生成高难度数学问题来提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学问题生成方法基于模板转换，缺乏多样性与可扩展性，限制了模型的推理提升。

Method: 通过从PlanetMath中随机抽取概念-解释对生成新问题，避免与现有数据的重叠；采用九种预定义策略作为生成约束，并通过强化学习优化问题的有效性及复杂性；通过推理轨迹长度反映认知复杂度，促进长链式推理问题的生成。

Result: 在五个基准（易、中、难）上的实验表明，MathSmith无论是短或长CoT推理设置下都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MathSmith有效生成高质量、高难度问题，展现了合成数据在提升LLM推理能力上的潜力，也具备良好的扩展性与概念迁移能力。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的RL框架——Cooper，通过联合优化策略模型和奖励模型，提高了大语言模型在推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型奖励和规则奖励存在问题：规则奖励缺乏鲁棒性，模型奖励易于被黑。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，联合优化策略模型和奖励模型，并引入混合注释策略和基于参考的奖励建模范式。

Result: 通过Cooper和VerifyRM进行了实验，展示出Cooper能缓解奖励黑客问题并提升RL表现，如在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct中实现0.54%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是对抗奖励黑客的有效方式，为奖励模型在RL中的应用提供了参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

TL;DR: OmniEAR提出了一种评估语言模型在实体任务中物理交互、工具使用和多代理协调能力的方法，但发现现有模型在应对这些任务时仍有显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现有语言模型在具身智能任务中的表现，分析其在工具推理和协作策略等方面的能力与问题。

Method: 设计了OmniEAR框架，通过文本表征的方式模拟物理属性和空间关系，覆盖家居与工业场景的1500个任务场景，进行系统性评估。

Result: 在显式指令情况下成绩为85-96%，而涉及工具推理的成功率降至56-85%，在隐式协作中为63-85%，复合任务失败率超过50%。模型在完整环境信息下的表现下降，对任务相关约束的过滤能力不足。单代理任务的微调效果显著提升（0.6%到76.3%），但对多代理任务提效有限（1.5%到5.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，具身推理任务对当前模型提出了完全不同的挑战，OmniEAR成为推动具身AI系统发展的重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新奖励函数，结合了事实精度、细节程度以及答案相关性，通过在线强化学习提升大语言模型的事实性推理性能，在六个基准测试中显著降低了幻觉率并提高了回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的推理型大型语言模型（R-LLMs）在复杂推理任务上取得进展，但在长文本事实性任务中表现出幻觉率高的问题，因此需要设计新的方法来提升其事实性表现。

Method: 本文提出了一种新型奖励函数，结合事实精度、细节程度和答案相关性，旨在通过在线强化学习改进模型。这种方法避免了以往利用自动化事实性评估作为奖励函数带来的奖励作弊问题。

Result: 在六个长文本事实性基准测试中，模型的幻觉率平均降低了23.1个百分点，回答的细节程度提高了23%，同时整体回答的有用性没有下降。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了通过优化奖励函数并采用在线强化学习的方式，可以显著提升推理型大型语言模型在长文本事实性任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过线性探测方法研究大语言模型(LLMs)在多轮对话中的说服动态能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在更好地理解LLMs如何在多轮对话中影响和说服人类。

Method: 结合认知科学，从说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略等不同方面训练线性探测模型，分析对话中的说服动态。

Result: 探测模型能有效识别对话中被说服的具体点及整体数据集中的说服成功动态，且在一些情境下优于提示方法。

Conclusion: 线性探测方法在分析复杂行为（如说服或操控）方面具有潜力，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据集分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H-NET++是一个无需分词器的分层动态分块模型，在处理形态丰富语言上表现优异，具有较高的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字节级语言模型在处理形态丰富语言时存在计算效率问题，本文希望通过分层动态分块改进对这类语言的处理。

Method: 提出H-NET++模型，使用轻量级Transformer，上下文混合注意力，两级潜在超先验和面向特定语言特性的训练策略等创新方法。

Result: 在1.4B-Token的波斯语语料库上表现显著优于现有模型，包括0.159 BPB减少、ParsGLUE得分提升5.4百分比、对ZWNJ损坏的鲁棒性提升53%及对形态边界的F1得分达73.8%。

Conclusion: H-NET++无需明确监督即可学习到符合形态学的分块策略，是处理形态丰富语言的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械需要及时维护以避免灾难性故障并优化运作效率。

Method: 将轴承振动数据转换为自然语言供LLM处理，同时结合多代理生成实现智能维护规划。

Result: 在轴承振动数据集中，经验证系统具有有效的异常检测能力，并提供相关的维护指导。

Conclusion: 研究提出一种可扩展的框架，将LLM应用于工业维护，并为跨领域工业提供智能化决策支持。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Method: 研究对比了三种实现方法：1) 在线方法使用云端LLM；2) 离线半自动方法采用传统机器学习模型；3) 基于SLM的小型离线模型在浏览器中运行。

Result: 第三种方法的准确率最高，达到0.93精确匹配度、0.99 Levenshtein相似度，以及ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L得分为0.98。同时通过在客户端计算减少了服务器负载。

Conclusion: 基于浏览器的离线小型语言模型在AWebGIS中是可行且高效的，从而为隐私保护和可扩展性提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Method: 提出三种实用非理想情景：摘要推断、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤；采用策略梯度算法对LLMs和最新视觉语言模型(LVLM)进行强化学习微调，并在八个公共数据集中测试表现。

Result: 发现RL微调在理想场景下提升推理能力，但非理想场景表现显著下降，其推理能力被过高估计。

Conclusion: 现有方法难以消除推理能力缺陷，需重视在非理想场景下对模型推理能力的评估。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 目前的多任务学习模型在配体对接上的表现逊于蛋白位点对接，主要由于二者的结构复杂性差异。

Result: 实验表明，LoopPlay算法在配体结合模式预测上相较于现有方法提升了约10%的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了分子对接的准确性，为药物开发过程提供了具潜力的改进方法。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular

### [150] [Can Large Language Models Integrate Spatial Data? Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05009)
*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在城市空间数据集成中的潜力，并采用审核修订方法来提高其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法完全覆盖边界情况，需要人工验证和数据标注。本研究旨在利用LLMs提升空间数据集成能力。

Method: 分析LLMs在基于人类经验的空间关系中的表现，提供相关特征以减轻其推理负担，并采用审核修订方法修正初始错误响应。

Result: 当减少LLMs对空间推理的依赖时，其生成效果显著提升，审核修订方法对初始错误的矫正能力强。

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的有力替代，能够更灵活地适应空间数据集成的需求，但仍需进一步研究优化。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页导航中的AGI研究多聚焦于离线模仿学习或在线探索，但缺乏有效结合这两种方法的框架。

Method: 提出基于人类双系统认知理论的CogniWeb框架，可根据任务复杂度在快速直觉和深思熟虑推理间自适应切换。

Result: 在WebArena测试中，CogniWeb实现了43.96%的成功率，并显著降低了75%的令牌使用量，展现了效率和竞争力优势。

Conclusion: CogniWeb成功证明了通过结合离线学习与在线探索的统一框架可以提升网页导航AGI的性能，同时提高效率。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性的医学多模态知识编辑基准MedMKEB，用于评估医疗领域多模态大语言模型的知识更新性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗多模态AI随着知识更新的需求不断增加，无法在不完全重新训练的情况下高效地修改过时或错误的知识。

Method: 开发了一种基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集的基准MedMKEB，设计了多种编辑任务，并通过专家验证以确保其准确性和可靠性。

Result: 基于最先进的多模态大语言模型进行实验，发现现有方法在医学知识编辑中仍有不足，凸显了发展专门编辑策略的必要性。

Conclusion: MedMKEB为医学知识编辑算法的发展提供了标准基准，将促进更加可信和高效的知识编辑方法的研发。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

TL;DR: EasySize是一种轻量级设计框架，利用优化算法和大规模模型Fine-tuning，实现了跨工艺节点的模拟电路门控尺寸优化，并显著节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模拟电路设计方法耗时且依赖工程师经验，传统基于AI的方法依然存在通用性不足、模型庞大、不易迁移的挑战。

Method: 提出基于Qwen3-8B模型的EasySize框架，结合差分进化和粒子群优化算法，动态调整损失函数，构建高效的优化流程，支持跨多种技术节点和电路拓扑实现优化。

Result: 在不同技术节点和放大器电路中，EasySize无需额外训练就超越现有强化学习平台，在大多数任务中性能更佳，并减少了96.67%以上的资源消耗。

Conclusion: EasySize能够减少对人类专业知识和计算资源的依赖，简化模拟电路设计过程，有潜力显著提升设计效率。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Motivation: 探索生成式AI作为高等教育核心基础设施的潜力，验证其在支持学生批判性和反思性思维中的作用，并挑战其可能导致去技能化的观点。

Method: 设计了一个对照实验，让65名德国的预备教师学生分别与“苏格拉底AI导师”和未指导的AI聊天机器人交互，以比较其在促进学生独立、反思性学习中的支持效果。

Result: 使用“苏格拉底AI导师”的学生报告其在批判性、独立性和反思性思维方面得到了显著支持，表明对话式AI可以促进元认知参与。

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统日志重建方法的局限性（需要流程模型或利用机器学习/深度学习进行预测），提出一种基于异构图神经网络的解决方案来处理缺失信息问题。

Method: 开发了一种异构图神经网络模型，将其应用于包含不完整事件的流程日志中，以重建丢失的属性信息。

Result: 在两组合成日志和四组真实日志数据上对模型性能进行了评估，显示出其在重建所有事件属性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于异构图神经网络的模型在日志重建任务中表现优异，具有修复多属性缺失数据的潜力。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QA-Dragon的查询感知动态RAG系统，用于处理知识密集型VQA，其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RAG方法在处理复杂、多跳推理或需要最新事实知识时存在局限性。

Method: 引入领域路由器识别查询领域，结合搜索路由器选择最佳检索策略，实现多模态、多轮次、多跳推理。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM挑战中显著提高了模型推理性能，单源、多源和多轮任务上分别提升5.06%、6.35%和5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon在知识密集型VQA任务上展现了强大的多模态推理能力，超越了基线模型。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

significant challenges -- including information overload and longer response

We propose a novel framework that combines RDF graph databases with LLMs to
process natural language queries for precise audience targeting, while
providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture.
Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求一种方法整合符号逻辑推理和生成性语言模型的能力，解决以往系统中符号模块和神经模块松耦合的问题。

Method: 设计一个多智能体框架，将决策树和随机森林嵌入为统一推理系统中的可调用模块，结合大型语言模型进行推理。中央协调器负责保持一致性并促进跨模块和工具的通信。

Result: 系统在多项推理基准测试中表现优异。例如，在ProofWriter上提高逻辑一致性7.2%，在GSM8k中通过符号增强提高多步数学问题准确率5.3%，在ARC中通过符号调用提高抽象准确率6.0%。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了强大的、可解释且可扩展的解决方案，可广泛应用于临床决策支持和科学发现等领域。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究为改善研究清晰性和再现性提供了实用工具，同时支持更高效的政策制定。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Motivation: 研究获知LLMs在开放、多智能体语境中应对法律和伦理难题的能力，特别是挖掘其社会推理和说服能力的表现。

Method: 设计了一种名为NomicLaw的结构化多智能体模拟实验，探讨LLM如何通过提案、辩护和投票过程制定法律和影响集体决策。

Conclusion: 文中工作为未来开发能够自主协商、协调以及法律制定的AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨最小模型推理在描述逻辑（DL）中的复杂性问题，尤其是纯最小模型的可判定性。

Method: 研究DL中纯最小模型的推理，通过数学分析和逻辑化简，提出无环性条件以降低复杂性并探索与逐点限制的相关性。

Result: 发现概念满足性在纯最小模型中的不可判定性，同时揭示了DL-Lite族的复杂性，特别是DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$的复杂度。

Conclusion: 尽管纯最小模型存在复杂性和不可判定性问题，通过合理的约束条件，可以恢复推理的可判定性。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言模型在复杂、多问题推理任务中存在的评分过于粗粒度、无法有效学习的问题。

Method: 引入StructVRM方法，使用结构化的、多模态的奖励模型，基于语义和数学等价性提供细粒度的子问题级反馈。

Result: StructVRM方法在六个公开多模态基准和一个高难度STEM基准上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 结构化和可验证奖励的训练方法能显著提升多模态模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Motivation: 在智能交通系统中，铁路预测性维护对降低成本和提升安全性至关重要，因此需要一种高性能、可解释的实时故障预测方案。

Method: 开发了一个在线处理管道，包括样本预处理模块、增量分类模型、以及自然语言与可视化解释模块。

Result: 在实验中，该方法在葡萄牙波尔图地铁数据集上的F-measure达到了98%以上，准确率为99%以上，并在类不平衡和噪声环境下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效预测早期故障信号，并提供明确的解释机制，证明其在铁路运营中具备实用性和可靠性，支持主动维护决策。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

*Xinrun Xu,Pi Bu,Ye Wang,Börje F. Karlsson,Ziming Wang,Tengtao Song,Qi Zhu,Jun Song,Zhiming Ding,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DeepPHY框架，用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)在物理原则理解与推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM在复杂动态环境中的精确性能较差，亟需对其物理规则理解和推理能力进行评估。

Method: 设计DeepPHY基准框架，包含多个物理推理环境和细粒度评估指标，用于系统性评估VLMs。

Result: 当前最先进的VLM在将物理知识转化为精确预测控制方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: DeepPHY有效评估VLMs物理推理局限性，为改进模型提供了参考。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLMs解决化学合成过程中的挑战，包括优化反应规划、结果预测以及实验自动化，最终加速分子创新，推动更绿色和数据驱动的化学。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

*Krzysztof Janowicz,Zilong Liu,Gengchen Mai,Zhangyu Wang,Ivan Majic,Alexandra Fortacz,Grant McKenzie,Song Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了AI系统的地域性对齐问题，即AI输出如何根据用户地理位置和文化背景进行调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在全球范围内已经深深嵌入日常生活，但由于地区间在文化、法律及政治上的差异，使得确保AI行为符合区域性规范成为一项挑战。

Method: 回顾地理研究的关键问题，讨论未来研究主题，并提供用于评估AI对齐敏感性的方法。

Result: 指出了当前AI对齐方法可能导致与统计现实或区域文化不符的结果，如性别平衡等问题，并强调地理敏感性的重要性。

Conclusion: 随着AI自动化的快速扩展，需要一种时空感知的对齐方法，以避免一刀切的局限性，并确保AI系统更好地服务于全球多样性。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出 Bench-2-CoP 框架，量化现有 AI 基准与新监管框架间的差距，并发现关键功能能力评估严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于《欧盟人工智能法案》和相关实践守则的出台，现有 AI 评估工具未能覆盖新监管框架关注的系统性风险。

Method: 引入 Bench-2-CoP 框架，利用 LLM-as-judge 分析，评估现有基准问题集与《欧盟人工智能法案》中模型能力和倾向间的覆盖程度。

Result: 评估显示现有基准过度关注行为倾向（如幻觉倾向和歧视性偏见），而关键功能能力（如逃避人类监管、自我复制）完全未覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面定量分析此差距，为政策制定者完善守则和开发者改进评估工具提供关键见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 情感对话识别(ERC)探索对话中的情感变化，但数据匮乏且现有数据集存在偏见和标签主观性问题。本文提出利用小型高效的通用LLM生成新的ERC数据集，提升现有数据集的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC旨在识别对话中的情感转变，是增强机器智能的关键步骤。但由于数据稀缺、数据源偏差和标签的主观性，其研究面临巨大挑战。本文希望通过生成新的ERC数据集克服这些问题。

Method: 利用小型、高效的通用型LLM工具，针对三种最常用的ERC基准数据集生成六个新数据集，并通过实验验证其对ERC任务的补充效果及标签不平衡性的影响分析。

Result: ERC分类器在新生成的数据集上表现出强大的稳健性，并在现有ERC基准上实现了统计显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 生成的ERC数据集有效补充了现有资源，可增强ERC分类器对情感识别的表现，同时表明利用小型LLM生成数据是一种高效的方案。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了InfiAlign模型，该模型通过高效的数据选择与SFT和DPO相结合，优化LLMs以提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的推理能力提升依赖于高资源消耗，现有方法的样本效率较低且扩展性较差，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出InfiAlign框架，结合监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，并通过多维质量指标自动筛选高质量的数据集以提高样本效率。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，使用仅约12%的训练数据达到了与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B相当的性能，并在AIME 24/25基准测试中实现了平均3.89%的性能提升。

Conclusion: InfiAlign融合高效数据选择与全阶段后训练，为大规模推理模型的扩展提供了一种可行且高效的解决方案，并展示了显著的任务推广能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为GRAIL的新框架，通过图检索增强大语言模型的推理能力，显著提升了问答精度和F1得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG技术主要针对非结构化数据，对结构化知识（如知识图谱）的处理效果有限，尤其在捕获图全局结构和精度控制方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，结合LLM引导的随机探索和路径过滤生成数据，并通过两阶段训练策略学习动态决策路径，使图检索过程在广度和精度间实现动态平衡。

Result: 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，GRAIL平均提升准确率21.01%，F1得分提高22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过改进的检索机制和训练方法，显著增强了基于知识图谱的推理能力，为结构化数据的推理应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种领域无关的评估框架以评价代理任务完成情况，并通过分解任务和模块化步骤的方式提高评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法无法全面评估代理的推理过程，只关注最终结果，或局限于特定领域，因此需要一种更加通用的评估框架。

Method: 开发了一种模块化评估框架，通过将任务分解为子任务，并结合代理的输出和推理逐步验证每一步完成情况，最终汇总得出评估结果。

Result: 在两个基准数据集GAIA和BigCodeBench上的实验表明，Judge Agent与人类评估的对齐准确性分别提升了4.76%和10.52%，优于GPT-4o作为评估基线的表现。

Conclusion: 新的评估框架可以更有效地仿真人类评估方式，为代理任务完成情况的通用评估提供了可能性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Result: 最新的RoBERTa模型在测试数据上的加权F1分数为91.6%，精准度为92.4%，召回率为91.6%，表现出强一致性。

Conclusion: LORI工具通过自动化和精确分析提升了研究生入学流程的效率，同时确保了对申请者能力的全面评估，尤其是与STEM领域相关的领导技能评估。

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

*Rui Lu,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Feng Xiao,Yuntao Du,Yijun Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多视角代理辩论框架（MV-Debate）用于检测社交媒体中的有害内容，其显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体内容日益复杂，其文字、图像等多模态信号交互可能隐藏有害意图，传统方法难以有效识别。

Method: 设计了一个名为MV-Debate的框架，集成了四个代理：表层分析、深层推理、模态对比和社会语境分析，通过动态反射门控策略进行多轮辩论迭代。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，MV-Debate显著优于单一模型基线和现有多代理辩论方法。

Conclusion: 本研究指出多代理辩论方法在提高社交内容意图检测的可靠性方面具有巨大潜力，适用于在线安全关键场景。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用主动推断（AIF）作为开发能够自主学习的AI代理的基础，无需依赖大量人工奖励设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统由于依赖高质量数据和人工奖励设计面临扩展性挑战，限制了真正自主智能的发展。

Method: 提出使用主动推断（AIF）替代外部奖励信号，结合大语言模型，赋予AI系统通过降低自由能进行探索与利用的能力。

Result: 文中方法能够支持AI代理自主学习经验，同时保持符合人类价值观。

Conclusion: 融合AIF和大语言模型为开发自主、受限于计算和物理约束的AI系统提供了有力路径。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的多代理框架LearnerAgent，用于模拟动态学习环境，并分析不同类型学习者的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究难以捕捉学习动态，追踪长期进展或提供解释性，因此需要开发更真实模拟人类学习行为的方法。

Method: 通过构建具有心理特质（如深度型、表面型、惰性型等）的学习者并进行为期一年的模拟过程，包括知识获取、战略选择和测试等来探究学习动态。

Result: （1）只有深度型学习者实现了持续的认知增长；（2）不同学习者的行为和心理特性高度一致；（3）通用学习者在自我效能感上显著提高；（4）基础LLM的默认行为模式为“勤奋但脆弱的表面型学习者”。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent框架能有效模拟真实情境，揭示LLMs行为的特性，为理解机器学习模型与人类学习行为的共性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

Motivation: 解决股票和加密货币价格波动性及非平稳性预测挑战，探索ESNs在应对极端波动中的表现及其在混沌分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用回声状态网络模型结合混沌分析工具（Lyapunov指数）评估价格数据，并与传统机器学习方法进行性能比较。

Result: 证明ESNs在极端波动期间表现优异，其预测结果与Lyapunov指数分析一致，并显著优于Boosting和Naïve方法。

Conclusion: 表明ESNs在处理极端市场混沌和高波动环境方面具有鲁棒性与卓越优势，在加密货币预测领域具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

Motivation: 探讨如何在深度强化学习的高性能与解释性之间取得平衡，解决安全关键型任务中缺乏信任的问题。

Method: 提出一种名为MLES的框架，利用多模态大语言模型进行策略生成，并结合进化机制进行优化。同时结合视觉反馈行为分析，通过识别失败模式促进策略改进。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLES在两个控制任务中效率和性能与PPO相当，同时提供透明的控制逻辑和可追踪的设计流程。

Conclusion: MLES克服了传统领域特定语言的局限性，有助于知识迁移和重用，在控制策略解释性生成中展现出应用前景。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

Motivation: 现有网络对齐模型在解释决策方面能力有限，特别是在高风险领域难以建立信任。

Method: 提出了一个模型无关的解释框架NAEx，通过可学习的边和特征掩码，以及优化目标函数，提供对齐模型关键子图及特征的解释。

Result: NAEx成功在基准数据集上与四种代表性网络对齐模型集成，并证明其在效率和解释能力上的效果。

Conclusion: NAEx框架大幅提升对齐模型解释性，为未见过数据生成高效解释，并基于其方法设计了适配对齐可解释性的评价指标。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

Conclusion: TrajEvo展示了快速、可解释、广泛适用的轨迹预测启发式设计的潜力，并为未来研究提供了开源代码。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

Motivation: 解决T2I生成中在复杂指令处理、细粒度控制和语义一致性方面的挑战。

Method: 提出LumiGen框架，包括智能提示解析与增强（IPPA）模块和迭代视觉反馈与优化（IVFR）模块，通过LVLM驱动的闭环反馈机制提升图像生成性能。

Result: LumiGen在LongBench-T2I基准测试中取得了3.08的平均分，显著优于现有技术，尤其在文本呈现和姿势表达方面提升显著。

Conclusion: 通过引入LVLM，LumiGen证明了其在更可控和高质量图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

Conclusion: 框架通过联合学习，支持设备端个性化模型和服务端全局模型的高效训练，同时采用加密的传输方式减轻了隐私风险，适用于边缘设备条件下的个性化生成场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的FSL方法，利用大规模多模态模型（LMMM）提高少样本学习的泛化能力，在多种科学领域展现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多科学领域，数据获取昂贵且有限，FSL可以有效弥补数据不足带来的影响。

Method: 构建了多模态少样本数据集（M3FD），并提出了新的框架M3F，通过模块化管道支持多种科学数据类型，提升了模型的实际应用能力。

Result: 通过微调模型，M3F显著提升了FSL模型在多个领域的性能，同时降低了LMMM应用的门槛。

Conclusion: M3F和M3FD为数据稀缺的科学领域提供了一种低门槛、高可扩展性的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol框架利用属性引导的强化学习提高大语言模型在分子属性预测任务中的效率，通过奖励机制改进模型推理过程，并显著提升预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大语言模型在分子属性预测中依赖人工设计的提示和模板，现有方法如DeepSeek-R1尽管尝试强化学习进行深度推理，但其推理往往冗长且缺少相关性。

Method: 提出AttriLens-Mol框架，通过（1）格式奖励，确保属性输出结构化；（2）计数奖励，避免无关属性枚举；（3）理性奖励，结合高级LLM和RDKit验证生成属性的相关性，引导模型更有效地进行分子属性预测。

Result: 实验表明，7B级别的R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5和R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1模型在小样本训练后表现优于监督微调模型和高级模型；生成的属性用于解释性决策树时性能更优。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol框架有效挖掘相关和预测能力强的分子属性，提升了预测性能与结果解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法PA-RNet，用于提高多模时间序列预测的稳健性，主要解决文本模态中的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模时间序列预测中，文本数据中的干扰问题，如噪声、不相关内容及矛盾性带来的性能下降。

Method: 设计了一个扰动感知投影模块及跨模态注意力机制，有效分离文本嵌入中的噪声，同时维持语义的完整性；并建立理论分析证明方法稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，在多领域和多时间设定下，PA-RNet性能优于最新的基线方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet能有效提升多模时间序列预测的鲁棒性和泛化性，尤其在文本噪声存在的情况下。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为InfoQ的训练无关框架，用于高效混合精度量化，通过单次前向传递评估层的量化敏感性，以优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖高计算成本的搜索算法，要么基于局部敏感性代理，但都难以准确测量层量化对全网络的信息流影响。

Method: 提出InfoQ框架，以单次前向传递下的互信息变化测量层敏感性，并将位宽分配问题建模为整数线性规划问题，在预算限制下优化量化配置。

Result: 该方法显著提高搜索速度，减少两数量级所需数据，同时在高压缩率下对MobileNetV2和ResNet18模型取得高达1%的精度提升。

Conclusion: InfoQ框架展示了在有效性和效率上的显著优势，适用于资源受限设备上的深度神经网络部署。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

TL;DR: 本研究评估了开源大型语言模型（LLMs）作为1型糖尿病胰岛素剂量决策支持的潜力，与小型神经网络增强学习代理（SRAs）进行了比较，发现LLMs在设计良好的提示下可以接近甚至优于SRAs，但仍存在逻辑缺陷需要改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于增强学习的动态治疗方案虽然能实现复杂临床决策，但由于需要大量工程工作整合临床知识，限制了其实用性。而LLMs的发展提供了基于语言提示实现隐式知识嵌入的新可能。

Method: 利用1型糖尿病模拟器，评估了开源LLMs在零样本推断条件下的表现，并与经过专门训练的SRAs进行比较，探讨提示结构与模型性能的关系及其局限性。

Result: 在稳定患者群体中，小型LLMs（如Qwen2.5-7B）的性能可与经过充分训练的SRAs相当甚至更优，但模型在复杂动态环境中败性能较差，并表现出诸如错误逻辑推导和临床判断不一致等问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床中具有广阔前景，但需要通过精心提示设计、验证和与生理建模的结合，以克服其不足并提升安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力恢复决策方案因忽视弱势社区请求量的差异性，导致这些社区长时间停电，呼吁一个既高效又均衡的能源恢复策略。

Method: 设计了一种名为EPOPR的框架，结合Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression（预测不确定性）和Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL（处理区域间不同不确定性）的方法，实现公平与效率兼顾的决策。

Result: EPOPR将平均停电时长降低了3.60%，且社区间的不平等减少了14.19%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EPOPR策略在权衡效率与公平性方面表现出色，为公平电力恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐方法难以应对非静态数据流，而持续学习推荐方法需要集中数据访问，与联邦学习约束不符，因此需要一种结合两者特点的解决方案。

Method: 提出了F3CRec框架，结合了客户端上的自适应重放记忆和服务器端的按项目时间均值组件，分别用于保留用户偏好和整合新知识与旧知识。

Result: 实验证明，与现有方法相比，F3CRec在联邦环境中更能长期保持推荐质量。

Conclusion: F3CRec在隐私保护的同时，实现了对流数据的学习，在联邦推荐领域是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

Motivation: 现有方法多注重运营收益，忽略用户及司机体验，亟需在保证效率的基础上实现公平性与偏好的平衡。

Method: 提出HCRide系统，采用和谐导向的多智能体强化学习算法，包括多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络。

Result: 在深圳和纽约的真实数据集中，HCRide相比先进基准分别提升了效率2.02%、公平性5.39%、司机偏好10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide系统能有效平衡乘客公平性和司机偏好，同时提高系统整体效率，提供以人为本的网约车体验。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

*Robert Frenken,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Hanqin Zhang,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合无监督异常检测和监督图学习的多阶段入侵检测框架，主要用于汽车CAN通信的网络安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CAN协议缺乏内置的安全保护机制，容易受到网络攻击，因此需要更有效的入侵检测方法。

Method: 采用VGAE进行结构性异常检测并选择性欠采样，随后结合KD-GAT进行攻击分类，同时支持按分数级别的融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够在六个公共数据集上实现平均F1分数提升16.2%，并在高不平衡数据集上实现高达55%的提升，同时显著减少了96%的模型参数。

Conclusion: 该框架在准确性、效率及应对不平衡数据方面有明显优势，为CAN网络安全提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化深度神经网络特别是大语言模型的内存和计算成本，同时为OPTQ等流行算法提供缺失的理论保证。

Method: 分析OPTQ的量化误差来源，推导出非渐近性的2范数误差边界，并对随机和确定性变体进行了单独研究；还拓展到Qronos算法，对其理论优势进行了解释。

Result: 为OPTQ和Qronos提供了全面的理论误差边界分析，包括确定性和随机性变体的分析，验证了设计选择的合理性，如按特征的范数降序排列。

Conclusion: 本研究为后训练量化领域提供了坚实的理论基础，拓展了包括OPTQ和Qronos在内的算法的理解，并提出了设计改进和参数选择的指导。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

*Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki,Yangtian Zi,Zixuan Wu,Tejas Oberoi,Carolyn Jane Anderson,Joydeep Biswas,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Agnostics的语言无关后训练管道，旨在解决低资源语言模型性能提高中的工程瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言中表现优异，但在低资源语言中的表现不佳，受限于数据不足和每种语言新的工程需求。

Method: 通过语言无关的管道，以代码的外部行为作为评判依据，实现无需逐一为每种语言建立基础设施，包括使用单一验证器解决代码验证问题、重写数据集并通过RLVR进行训练。

Result: Agnostics在Lua、Julia、R、OCaml和Fortran五种低资源语言上显著提升了模型性能，并以16B及以下参数模型在多语言基准上的表现刷新了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Agnostics提供了一种简化的通用语言后训练方法，通过开放数据集和配置文件降低了RL训练技术的应用门槛。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了希尔伯特神经算子（HNO），结合信号处理中的强归纳偏差对PDE解算子进行建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经算子方法如傅里叶神经算子（FNO）受限于傅里叶变换周期性假设的局限性，且缺乏从信号的相位和振幅之外挖掘更多信息的能力。

Method: 引入希尔伯特神经算子（HNO），利用希尔伯特变换将输入信号映射到解析表示，显式提取瞬时振幅和相位信息，并基于此应用光谱卷积的可学习操作。

Result: 通过理论分析，展示了HNO设计的合理性和它在因果性、相位敏感及非平稳系统建模方面的潜力。

Conclusion: HNO结合解析信号理论中的特性，能够更有效地建模复杂系统的解算子，是现有方法的有效扩展。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

Conclusion: GM层作为概率分布的直接表达方式，能够提供新的动态表现及与典型网络不同的特性，有助于神经网络理论的进一步发展。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Conclusion: 使用先进的机器学习方法优化臭氧偏差的建模，不仅提升了模型精度，还为改善城市尺度环境政策决策提供了科学支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“检索增强预测（RAF）”的新框架，利用历史类似的水文数据提高未来水位预测的准确性，并在实际数据中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水位预测对湿地生态系统的管理至关重要，但当前深度学习模型在跨领域普适性和适应性上存在不足，尤其是在水文领域应用较少。

Method: 提出了RAF框架，借助外部存储的历史水文数据，通过相似度和互信息两种方法检索相关历史片段，并将其作为模型输入进行预测，增强了模型的背景理解和预测能力。

Result: 在真实数据集（Everglades）上的实验表明，RAF框架显著提高了水位预测的准确性。

Conclusion: RAF方法彰显了其在环境水文学中应用的潜力，证明了一个无需特定微调的自适应AI方法能有效改进生态系统管理中的预测任务。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Motivation: 迁移学习的发展虽然提升了模型在新领域的适应性，但其可复现性问题一直没有深入研究，特别是动态调整训练数据的重要性排序的策略可能影响结果的一致性。

Method: 引入了选择敏感性（Δ_Q）这一度量，分析适应性选择策略如何因训练数据的变化而产生响应，并利用理论证明及多NLI语料上的实验验证这一关系。

Result: 实验表明，高度适应性的策略，如基于梯度的选择或课程学习，尽管任务表现优异，但可复现性失败率高。而低适应性的策略失败率可维持在7%以下，通过源领域预训练，可进一步将失败率降低30%。

Conclusion: 研究提供了迁移学习中性能与可复现性权衡的指导原则，强调考虑可复现性设计的必要性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台虽然促进了信息传播，但也成为仇恨言论的滋生地，对个人和社区产生重大负面影响，因此需要开发自动化的仇恨言论检测方法。

Method: 使用MetaHate数据集对多种前沿Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA）进行仇恨言论检测，通过模型微调提升检测能力。

Result: ELECTRA在仇恨言论检测中表现最佳，F1分数高达0.8980，并指出分类错误主要来源于讽刺、编码语言和标签噪声。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在仇恨言论检测方面表现出色，细调ELECTRA模型尤其适合处理这类任务，同时未来应针对语言模糊性和数据噪声问题优化。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

Motivation: 现有DAL研究中缺乏统一平台来在多样化条件下进行公平和系统的评估，特别是在存在分布偏移和数据不平衡等挑战的背景下。

Method: 构建统一平台ALScope，整合了图像与自然语言处理领域的10个数据集和21种DAL算法，允许灵活调整实验条件如数据不平衡和分布偏移比例，并进行全面的实验评估。

Result: 实验表明：（1）DAL算法的性能因领域与任务设置不同而差异显著；（2）在数据不平衡和开放集等非标准场景下算法的提升空间大；（3）部分算法性能良好但选择时间较长。

Conclusion: ALScope平台证明了其价值，为深入研究DAL算法在非标准场景中的改进需求和效率优化提供了基础。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Motivation: 解决SimulST系统在翻译质量和延迟间的权衡问题。

Method: 基于信息论原理引入REINA损失函数，通过现有非流式翻译模型训练适应性策略。

Result: 在多个语言对（如法语、西班牙语、德语与英语之间）上，利用仅限开源或合成数据训练的模型，达到了SOTA水平，并显著提升了延迟/质量平衡。

Conclusion: REINA能显著改善SimulST系统的流式效率，并对现有方法进行了有效的优化。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Method: 提出的自误差调整（SEA）方法将集成错误分解为个体表现项（自误差）与多样性项，并在损失函数中引入可调参数以精确控制每个部分的贡献，从而优化整体集成学习性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，SEA在多个公开回归和分类数据集上的表现优于基线方法，且提供了更灵活的调整能力和更稳定的多样性变化。

Conclusion: 通过引入可调参数的SEA框架，本文实现了对集成学习准确性与多样性权衡的精确把控，在理论和实践上均表现出明显优势。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文设计了两种压缩去中心化算法用于解决非凸随机优化，结合动量加速和信息压缩技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决非凸随机优化问题的通信成本和收敛速度问题，特别是数据异构场景下的挑战。

Method: 基于动量技术和消息压缩，分别提出了去中心化自适应方法（用于有界梯度场景）和重球方法（用于数据异构情境中的梯度跟踪）。

Result: 两种算法实现了最优的收敛速度、线性加速，同时支持与拓扑无关的算法参数，且在DNN与变压器模型训练中性能优越。

Conclusion: 两种压缩去中心化算法不仅理论上有效，且在实际训练中表现出色，为随机优化问题提供了创新性解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型缺乏预训练动态透明性和对特征保留的深入理解，同时忽视了信号处理领域的先进技术。研究动机在于开发一个透明、可解释的EEG基础模型，促进临床应用。

Method: 提出MENDR模型，利用离散小波分解从EEG数据中提取多分辨率系数，采用黎曼流形变压器架构，将EEG信号嵌入为对称正定矩阵，并能通过几何椭球体直观展示嵌入结果。

Result: MENDR在多个临床EEG任务中表现出接近最先进的性能，同时需要的参数量显著减少，并能够准确重建EEG信号。

Conclusion: MENDR实现了高效、可解释且具有临床应用潜力的EEG信号分析，展现了通过滤波器组和高级架构提升EEG基础模型表现的可能性。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

Conclusion: RCUKF整合了数据驱动建模和贝叶斯估计，在复杂系统中提供了一种有效的建模和状态估计解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

Conclusion: 提出的MMCI模型通过融合因果理论和多模态学习，显著提升了情感分析任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力，可在分布变化环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的训练依赖于人工标注和任务，限制了超越人类智能的能力发展。

Method: 提出R-Zero框架，从一个基础模型开始，通过挑战者与解决者的协作生成和学习新的数据和任务。

Result: 实验显示R-Zero显著提升了数学推理能力和通用领域推理能力，例如提高Qwen3-4B-Base模型在基准测试中的成绩。

Conclusion: R-Zero框架证明了自我进化的潜力，为构建超越人类智能的模型提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法需要大量数据和计算资源，难以适配小型语言模型，且现有课程学习方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 引入自步学习框架SPaRFT，通过语义和难度进行数据聚类进行数据精简，并使用多臂赌博机模型动态分配训练样本。

Result: SPaRFT在多个推理基准上表现优异，使用数据量减少最多可达到100倍。

Conclusion: 精心设计的、基于性能驱动的训练课程能够在更少资源的情况下提升语言模型推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Motivation: 目前AR系统虽然可以提升任务性能，但在安全关键场景中可能引发“认知隧道效应”，导致用户对情境感知的削弱。本文以心肺复苏术为例研究如何提高AR的安全性与SA。

Method: 开发了一款基于Magic Leap 2的AR应用，实时叠加CPR反馈，并设计模拟突发事件的实验，通过冻结试探法收集SA数据和眼动追踪信息，同时提出FixGraphPool图神经网络模型分析眼动模式和SA关系。

Result: FixGraphPool模型通过将眼动事件构造为时空图，实现了83.0%的准确率（F1=81.0%），优于其他基于特征的机器学习和时序模型。研究表明高级SA与更大的扫视幅度和速度、较少关注虚拟内容相关。

Conclusion: 研究显示眼动追踪在AR中应用于SA建模的潜力，并强调在设计AR系统时需注重用户安全与情境感知。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Conclusion: 通过重新解释遗忘动态推动深度学习中知识迁移的极限，提出了一条新的研究方向，KNOW预测为生成知识增强的权重提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Conclusion: 本文提出的TANGO框架通过结合能量函数学习与切向流动态，有效增强了图神经网络的信号传播能力及稳定性，同时提高了其通用性和预测性能。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Conclusion: 该方法比现有的主流方法更能有效地生成可靠的数据归因解释，展现了其在增强机器学习模型透明性方面的潜力。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架可显著缓解冷启动问题，提高偏好学习在数据受限环境中的样本效率和适用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

Conclusion: 多类弱监督信号的结合能够在有限数据标签的情况下显著提高分类性能，具有良好的理论与实用价值。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型强化学习框架，显著提升了函数调用任务的多功能性和准确性，在Berkeley函数调用排行榜上达到86.02%的整体准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数调用任务对大语言模型在现实应用中的成功至关重要，但现有的训练方法在复杂推理策略的开发上存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种强化学习框架，通过基于策略优化的策略和战略性熵探索，提高函数调用任务中的表现，结合两阶段数据准备流水线，确保高质量训练样本。

Result: 本文在Berkeley函数调用排行榜上达到顶尖表现，整体准确率为86.02%，在复杂多功能场景中的表现超过标准GRPO多达6%。

Conclusion: 本文方法大幅改进了函数调用任务中的推理能力，特别是在代码预训练模型中的表现优异，并计划公开代码、模型和数据集供社区使用。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

Conclusion: HFedATM方法有效解决了分层架构中的领域偏移问题，显著提升了模型学习和泛化性能，同时具有良好的理论保证和实际表现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Motivation: 针对深度神经网络逼近PDE弱解优化不足以及传统数值方法局限性，建立统一误差估计理论框架。

Method: 通过分析神经网络在Sobolev空间的逼近性质，使用W^(m,p)范数建立理论误差估计，并进行与经典数值方法的比较。

Result: 深度神经网络能够在逼近PDE弱解时提供优于有限元和谱方法的效果，特别是在高维空间，出现超收敛性能。

Conclusion: 研究填补了神经网络逼近PDE误差理论的空白，为科学计算中采用神经网络方法提供理论支持。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

TL;DR: 本文提出PSEO框架，用于解决后处理堆叠集成优化问题，通过模型选择、堆叠机制改进及超参数搜索，实现对后处理集成策略的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CASH方法在集成阶段多采用固定策略，缺乏对特定任务特性的适应性，阻碍了后处理集成效果的提升。作者通过提出一种新框架以解决该问题。

Method: PSEO框架通过二次规划选择基础模型，在多样性与性能间权衡；引入两种机制优化多层堆叠潜力；并创建超参数空间以优化后处理集成策略。

Result: 在80个公开数据集上的实验证明，PSEO在16种方法中测试排名最佳，平均排名为2.96。

Conclusion: PSEO框架显著提升后处理集成策略优化能力，在AutoML领域展现了强大的性能优势。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为pFedDSH的框架，用于动态客户端加入情境下的个性化联邦学习，能够有效解决旧客户端性能保持及新客户端适配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于现有个性化联邦学习中假设静态客户端参与，不适用于动态客户端加入的实际场景。论文研究在学习任务不变但新客户端不断加入情况下，如何维护旧客户端性能及实现高效知识转移。

Method: 使用基于中心超网络的框架pFedDSH，通过嵌入向量生成个性化模型，引入批次特定掩码保持旧知识稳定，并采用数据无关的回放策略辅助知识回传。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100及Tiny-ImageNet数据集实验显示，pFedDSH在性能稳定性和客户端间适应性方面优于现有技术方案。

Conclusion: pFedDSH框架在动态环境中有效解决了旧客户端性能保持和新客户端的适应问题，同时高效利用神经网络资源并提高了隐私性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

TL;DR: 提出了S$^2$M-Former，用于从EEG数据中解码听觉注意力，具有高性能和低能耗特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决EEG基础的听觉注意力解码（AAD）在复杂场景下，由于缺乏在能效约束下有效利用EEG特征的框架所带来的性能限制。

Method: S$^2$M-Former通过：1）基于生物学启发的对称架构结合空间和频率分支；2）引入轻量化的1D代替传统3D操作，显著减少参数及能耗。

Result: 在KUL、DTU和AV-GC-AAD三项基准测试中达到与现有SOTA方法相当甚至更好的解码准确性，同时能耗比最新ANN模型低5.8倍。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former是一种低功耗、高性能的听觉注意力解码解决方案，适用于神经引导的助听设备应用。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大模型对齐方法常需要昂贵的微调或高计算代价，无法兼顾对齐质量与计算成本，急需一种高效实用的方法。

Method: 提出了一种无需调整的推理时对齐方法HIA，利用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和双阶段过滤技术，优化了推理过程效率。

Result: 在HelpSteer和ComPRed数据集上，HIA在多目标、目标导向任务中超越了现有的推理方法基线，特别是在低推理预算下表现优异。

Conclusion: HIA为大语言模型的可扩展和个性化部署提供了实用的解决方案，兼顾了对齐质量与计算效率。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS

showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的物理信息时间积分深度算子网络（PITI-DeepONet），用于准确建模并在长时间范围内解决时间相关的偏微分方程（PDEs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间相关偏微分方程建模方法（FR和AR方法）在长期精确性和可靠性方面存在局限性，如因果依赖捕捉不够和误差积累问题。

Method: 提出一种PITI-DeepONet，训练网络学习时间导数算子，并结合物理信息或混合驱动目标，通过经典时间步进方案实现长期精准预测，同时在推断时监测残差以检测系统是否超出训练域。

Result: 在基准问题上，PITI-DeepONet比传统方法在长期推断中表现出色，减少了如一维热方程误差84%（FR）和79%（AR），一维Burgers方程误差87%（FR）和98%（AR），以及二维Allen-Cahn方程误差42%（FR）和89%（AR）。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet突破性地解决了FR和AR方法的不足，为复杂时间相关偏微分方程的长期精确集成提供了一种更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于广告平台采用分层架构处理请求和候选广告，但检索阶段无法获取精准且实时的出价信息，导致平台收入及广告效果不佳，亟需一种更具一致性的广告检索策略。

Method: 提出BAR框架，包含以下核心方法：1. 出价感知建模技术，利用单调约束学习和多任务蒸馏将出价信号引入；2. 异步近线推理，实时更新嵌入以回应市场反馈；3. 任务关注精炼模块，加强用户兴趣与商业价值信号的交互。

Result: 在阿里巴巴展示广告平台的部署结果表明，平台收入提升了4.32%，积极运营广告的展示量增长了22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR框架有效解决了检索阶段与排序阶段的一致性问题，不仅优化了平台收入，还提升了广告效果，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Conclusion: 新的混合模型提高了实时ROP预测的可靠性，为开发智能、经济高效的钻井优化系统奠定了基础，对钻井操作具有重要意义。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

*Ahmad Saeed Khan,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的倾向评分加权方法DFW，用于通过去混淆因子构造稳定有效的样本权重，改善协变量平衡和处理效应估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法如IPW在倾向评分具有高方差时可能导致权重不稳定，进而影响选择偏差的处理和效应估计，因此需要一种更稳定且高效的加权方法。

Method: 本文提出了Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)，通过去混淆因子计算权重，优先考虑低混淆样本，同时减轻高度混淆样本的影响，以构建更接近随机对照试验的伪人群。

Result: 通过在真实数据和合成数据上的大量实验表明，DFW在协变量平衡性和处理效应估计方面优于现有的方法如IPW和CBPS。

Conclusion: DFW方法改进了倾向评分加权的稳定性和有效性，能够更好地模拟随机对照试验，并适用于二进制和多治疗场景。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

TL;DR: 研究提出Fairy±i，一个首次用于复杂值LLM的2位量化框架，突破现有量化技术的精度上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QAT研究集中于降低全精度模型的量化误差，没有研究尝试突破精度上限。

Method: 提出了Fairy±i框架，采用复数域中的权重量化方法，映射至单位根集合{±1, ±i}，实现2位有效表示，且无需乘法，仅通过加法和元素交换完成推理。

Result: Fairy±i在困惑度和下游任务上都优于现有2位量化方法的上限，同时保持存储与计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为在极低比特约束下构建高精度且实用的LLM开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种名为LIGHTYEAR的点对点联邦学习框架，以解决传统集中式FL的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式联邦学习存在单点故障、有限的个性化能力以及模型更新选择难以可靠的缺点。

Method: 设计了一个去中心化P2P的FL框架，通过本地验证数据上的一致性得分筛选个性化可信更新，结合正则化项进行聚合。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，LIGHTYEAR在客户级表现上优于集中式基线和现有P2P方法，尤其在对抗和异质条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR在分布式情境中提供更强的鲁棒性和一致性，是集中式FL的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在医学问答和编程表现出色，但在生成可解释的计算表型方面研究较少，而这可能对改进高血压患者的临床决策支持有重要意义。

Method: 评估LLMs在零样本表现的同时，提出了一种“生成、执行、调试、指令”策略，通过数据反馈迭代优化CPs生成效果。

Result: 结果表明，结合迭代学习的LLMs能够生成可解释且相对准确的CPs程序，并在使用更少训练示例的情况下接近于当前最先进机器学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: LLMs结合迭代学习策略在生成可解释计算表型方面具有潜力，可有效用于支持高血压患者的临床决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法（如LoRA）受限于基础模型架构，限制了其跨异构语言模型的应用。

Method: 提出了Cross-LoRA框架，包含LoRA-Align和LoRA-Shift两个模块，通过SVD和线性变换对齐子空间，将源LoRA权重映射到目标模型空间，无需额外数据或训练。

Result: 在ARCs, OBOA和HellaSwag任务上，Cross-LoRA相较于基础模型有最高5.26%的性能提升，在其他基准测试中与直接训练的LoRA适配器表现相当。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA能够在无需额外数据和训练的情况下，高效实现LoRA模块的跨模型迁移，并且在短时间内完成轻量化适应，适用性强。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法MoBE（Mixture-of-Basis-Experts）以在最小精度下降的情况下压缩大型语言模型中的参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MoE的LLM存在内存需求过大和现有压缩方法导致显著精度下降的问题，亟需一种有效的模型压缩方法。

Method: 通过将专家中的上/门矩阵使用低秩分解为W = AB，其中矩阵A特定于每个专家，而更大的矩阵B则被重新参数化为多个共享基矩阵的线性组合，最终通过最小化权重矩阵重构误差进行学习。

Result: 与现有方法相比，MoBE在压缩参数数量同时精度下降最小化方面表现优异，例如，可以在精度仅下降1%-2%的情况下减少24%-30%的参数数量。

Conclusion: MoBE提供了一种有效方式来在降低内存需求的同时维持大型语言模型的高性能，并显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Motivation: 旨在改善单一模型在时间序列建模和非线性特征描绘方面的不足，从而实现更准确的海洋叶绿素浓度预测。

Method: 通过结合LSTM和RF的优点，利用多源数据（如温度、盐度、溶解氧等）训练和测试，并采用标准化处理和滑动窗口方法。

Result: 混合模型在测试集上取得的R^2为0.5386、MSE为0.005806、MAE为0.057147，性能显著优于单独使用LSTM (R^2=0.0208)和RF (R^2=0.4934)。

Conclusion: LSTM-RF模型在预测海洋生态变量方面表现优异，为高频次预测提供了一种创新解决方案。

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological

TL;DR: FlowState提出了一种全新的时间序列基础模型（TSFM），克服了当前模型在泛化、适应性和计算效率方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在自然语言处理领域取得了巨大成功，但其在时间序列预测中的表现尚未实现类似突破，因此需要开发能在不同时间上下文和目标长度间泛化的模型，且具备高效性和适应性。

Method: 提出FlowState架构，结合状态空间模型（SSM）编码器和函数基解码器，实现连续时间建模和动态时间尺度调整，同时引入高效的预训练策略提升模型稳健性和训练速度。

Result: FlowState在最小模型规模下，超越了现有所有时间序列基础模型，在GIFT-ZS和Chronos-ZS基准中取得了最新的最佳表现，并通过消融实验验证了其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowState通过解决目前时间序列基础模型的核心挑战，展示了其独特的在线适应输入采样率变化的能力，具备更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Motivation: 传统的监管微调不能有效利用隐性用户反馈信号，如停留时间和情感倾向。本研究旨在解决此问题，提高推荐系统与用户偏好的契合度。

Method: 设计了一个奖励模型（R_φ），通过弱标注的用户交互信息学习，并使用近端策略优化（PPO）方法优化基础LLM（M_θ），显式建模多轮对话状态转换和动作生成。

Conclusion: 隐性信号对齐是一种高效的策略，可实现可扩展且用户适应性强的对话推荐系统设计。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$

Method: 通过SFO复杂性分析，提出理论上优化的批大小和学习率增长策略，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，提出的增长调度可以显著降低计算复杂性和提升大批量训练的效率。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习中的大批量高效训练提供了理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Result: 实验表明，与现有调度器相比，所提出的联合调度器加快了SGD的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 利用关键批量大小理论，自适应调整批量大小和学习率能够显著提升SGD的训练效率。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的交互模仿学习受限于人类教学的高成本。本研究旨在通过有效利用新手自身的计划和不确定性信息，以减少人类教师的查询频率。

Method: 设计了ASkDAgger框架，引入了三种核心技术：(1) S-Aware Gating调整查询标准以平衡成功率；(2) FIER通过重用有效的新手行动计划转化为示例；(3) PIER通过不确定性、成功率和时间优先级对经验进行重放。

Conclusion: ASkDAgger通过综合新手计划和反馈，显著减少了教学负担，提高了交互模仿学习的效果，为领域自适应提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

### [248] [Optimal Corpus Aware Training for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05364)
*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种名为Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT)的新方法，通过冻结大部分参数，仅微调与语料相关的小部分参数，显著提升模型的翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Corpus Aware Training (CAT)需要预定义高质量数据组，该过程容易出错且效率低下，因此需要一种更高效且稳健的方法来实现语料感知训练。

Method: 提出了OCAT，通过冻结大部分模型参数，仅调整与语料相关的小部分参数，从而在CAT预训练模型的基础上进行高效微调。

Result: 在WMT23的英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别相较基础训练提升了+3.6和+1.8的chrF分数，同时在超参数敏感性方面优于其他先进微调技术。

Conclusion: OCAT具有轻量化、抗过拟合和提升模型准确性的优势，为语料相关模型训练提供了一种更高效的方法。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

*Newton Mwai,Emil Carlsson,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种处理潜在状态偏好顺序变化的策略，比传统潜在多臂老虎机算法更具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化任务中从零学习的成本太高，而潜在多臂老虎机算法虽然能减少探索，但对模型的假设太严格，难以应对不同奖励分布的潜在状态。

Method: 通过仅假设潜在状态下动作的偏好顺序模型，放松了对潜在多臂老虎机的严格要求，并提出了一种基于后验采样的算法。

Result: 算法在奖励分布已知且指定的情况下，与传统潜在多臂老虎机算法表现相当，而在奖励分布随潜在状态变化的情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了潜在多臂老虎机模型的适应性，特别适用于奖励分布不同的潜在状态场景，对于个性化决策任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

*Jie Xiao,Shaoduo Gan,Changyuan Fan,Qingnan Ren,Alfred Long,Yuchen Zhang,Rymon Yu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Echo的强化学习系统，能够将轨迹采样和策略优化过程分离，解决了传统方法中因使用单一GPU集群导致的切换开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RL基于后训练方法在轨迹采样和策略优化环节存在共享GPU资源的问题，限制了分布式训练系统的效率。

Method: 提出了Echo系统，通过在异构的推理和训练资源上解耦两个阶段，并引入轻量级同步协议（顺序拉取模式和异步推送拉取模式）以优化硬件利用率。

Result: 在地理分布式集群上，Echo在收敛速度和最终奖励方面与完全共置的Verl基线相当，同时将轨迹生成委托给普通的边缘硬件。

Conclusion: Echo实现了LLM强化学习通过去中心化和异构资源达到数据中心级性能的可能性，为大规模RL应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为NT-ML的新防御机制，可有效防御深度神经网络中的高等级后门攻击，并通过试验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到后门攻击，这会导致模型在被触发时产生错误预测，因此需要设计新的防御机制来抵御这些攻击。

Method: 提出了非目标标签训练与互学习（NT-ML）方法，先通过标准训练获取准确的教师模型和对污损数据预测更精准的学生模型，然后通过互学习优化，最终获得净化后的学生模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，NT-ML可以有效防御6种后门攻击，并且在少量干净数据下的表现优于5种现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种有效且强大的深度神经网络后门攻击防御方法，其性能在多个场景下均优于其他方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Motivation: 探索和改进现有学习率自适应调整方法，以提高深度学习优化过程的效率和效果。

Result: 提出了一种修正的累积路径学习率调整方法，并展示了在特定条件下的实际效果和优于传统方法的场景。

Conclusion: 修正后的方法能更好反映Adam优化器的更新动态，自适应学习率机制在某些场景下能带来性能提升，但应用效果因条件而异。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: 引入了基于负二项分布的VAE模型NegBio-VAE来更真实地反映神经元尖峰数据的统计特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型（如Poisson-VAE）虽基于生物灵感，但未能有效捕捉神经元尖峰数据的随机性，限制了其建模能力。

Method: 通过负二项分布扩展VAE架构，加入一个额外的离散参数，同时开发了两种专门针对负二项分布的ELBO优化方案及可微分重新参数化策略。

Result: NegBio-VAE模型在重构准确度方面表现显著优于其它方法，表明对过度离散性的建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 捕捉神经活动中的过度离散性对于提高神经尖峰数据建模的精度具有重要意义。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

TL;DR: 该论文引入了一种名为CR-FMOL的联邦学习多目标优化模型，旨在通过锥形约束提升联邦学习中客户的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前联邦学习中FedAvg方法对少数客户支持不足的问题，同时提升现有联邦多目标优化方法对客户公平性的考量。

Method: 提出一种称为CR-FMOL的框架，通过新颖的锥形偏好约束，使客户的多目标优化达到Pareto最优；结合局部的多梯度下降平均和锥约束的Pareto子问题实现。

Result: 实验表明，在非独立同分布数据集上，CR-FMOL提升了客户的公平性。虽然初期性能稍逊于FedAvg，但在足够的训练回合后可达到相当的准确率。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL能够在多目标优化框架下显著增强客户公平性，同时保持良好的训练准确率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的任务适用性很广，但在某些专门领域仍需针对性优化，而现有方法如 GRPO 存在忽视候选响应语义交互的问题。

Method: 提出 Group Causal Policy Optimization (GCPO)，通过构建因果模型以映射隐藏依赖，并通过奖励调整与 KL 正则化将因果信息融入优化过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，GCPO 在多个推理基准测试中均优于 GRPO 等现有方法。

Conclusion: 引入 GCPO 不仅解决了 GRPO 的局限，还展示了因果方法在强化学习中的有效性，提高了推理任务的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前的生存分析通常将竞争风险视为截尾，但这种做法可能引入偏差，尤其是会加剧群体之间的不平等问题，因此需要深入研究其后果。

Method: 作者从理论和实证角度出发，建立了量化错误的框架，并通过一个心血管管理的案例分析，验证了这种处理方法的影响。

Conclusion: 为了提高生存模型的准确性，减少风险评估中的偏差并指导更有效的决策，研究人员需重新评估竞争风险的处理方法。

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险情境决策中，传统的MCTS方法仅基于期望收益，这容易忽视极端或高风险情况对决策的潜在影响，因此需要改进方法来提供更强的尾风险保障。

Method: 1. 提出CVaR-MCTS，将条件在险价值（CVaR）引入MCTS中，用于控制最坏$(1-α)%$情景中的期望损失。\n2. 提出W-MCTS，通过Wasserstein模糊集合描述尾部风险估计的不确定性，并提供PAC尾风险保障。

Result: 通过理论推导证明了CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS的尾风险和后悔界限，实验表明，这些方法相比现有基线可以有效实现尾风险保障，同时提升奖励和稳定性。

Conclusion: 文章提出的方法能够在高风险决策情境中显著优于传统方法，既提供了严格的尾风险保障，又提升了决策的实际收益与稳定性。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习时间序列预测方法在处理多尺度时间动态和数据不规则性上存在局限性，需要更精确的能源预测方法。

Method: 通过多尺度特征提取机制捕获不同时间分辨率的模式，使用概率预测框架进行不确定性估计，并整合未来已知变量，还引入了预训练和微调方式处理有限的能源数据集。

Result: 实验表明，与常用方法相比，预测误差降低7-12%，并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST为能源领域时间序列预测提供了具有显著性能改进的重要参考。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

Conclusion: 签名双向图拓扑在学习表示中举足轻重；性能差距可作为任务复杂性的度量；研究结果为模型压缩和解释性提供了实用启示。

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测模型通常忽略了电子健康记录中的临床观察互动过程，导致性能受限且模型难以适应新的医疗场景。

Method: 提出一种多任务递归神经网络，同时建模时间间隔和缺失过程特性，并结合感兴趣的生存结局进行联合建模。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集的实际死亡预测任务中，新方法比传统模型表现更优，且具有更好的可移植性。

Conclusion: 联合建模过程中的临床观察特性可以显著提高预测模型的性能和可移植性，凸显评估这种特性的必要性。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态电子健康记录(EHR)数据融合面临着数据要求高的挑战，亟需设计新的方法来有效集成多模态数据以提高临床预测能力。

Method: MoMA架构引入多个LLM代理，其中“专家代理”将非文本模态转化为结构化文本摘要，“聚合代理”结合多模态数据生成统一摘要，“预测代理”基于摘要进行临床预测。

Result: MoMA在三种真实数据集的预测任务中表现优于现有方法，显示了其在准确性和灵活性方面的优势。

Conclusion: MoMA充分证明了其在整合多模态EHR数据进行临床预测中的潜力，为该领域的研究提供了一种新的思路。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

TL;DR: 提出两种新的多视图聚类算法（AMVFCM-U和AAMVFCM-U），通过加入熵正则项与基于信噪比的特征加权方法，实现了无参数自适应聚类，并在五个基准数据集上表现优于15种现有方法。

Motivation: 解决传统多视图聚类中手动参数调整、异构数据整合困难及高维特征处理问题。

Method: 提出了AMVFCM-U和其改进版本AAMVFCM-U，以信噪比为基础的正则化进行特征加权，并采用双层熵正则化项自动平衡视图和特征贡献；AAMVFCM-U通过自适应阈值进行层次化降维。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法通过无参数的自适应聚类框架，实现了高效的多视图聚类、自动特征加权及重要视图组合识别。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

Motivation: 概率电路虽然可以进行精确和可处理的推断，但是它们的高昂的表述能力在数据有限的情况下容易造成过拟合问题。

Method: 分析了概率电路的对数似然地形图以及采用基于Hessian的正则化器进行培训，引入梯度范数正则化技术并纳入现有的EM和梯度方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了概率电路的过拟合问题，并通过平滑最优解显著提升了模型的泛化能力，提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

Motivation: 研究无标签数据下提升VLMs对下游任务的适应性。

Conclusion: 该综述为无监督VLM适应研究提供了清晰的方向和潜力方向，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VFL是一种新的垂直联邦学习框架，可以处理非对齐数据样本和部分缺失特征，并支持本地独立推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VFL无法处理非对齐数据样本，且不支持单客户本地独立推断。

Method: 提出名为X-VFL的新框架，包含两个模块：XCom用于补全缺失特征，DS-Align用于对齐决策子空间。此外，通过理论证明了训练算法的收敛性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10图像数据集表现提升15%，在MIMIC-III医疗数据集提升43%。

Conclusion: X-VFL在部分缺失特征和本地独立推断场景中表现出显著优越性。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入模型的负采样策略较为基础，缺乏高级解决方案，这限制了模型性能的提升。

Method: 设计并集成了一个模块，为PyKEEN框架提供多种静态和动态负采样技术，同时保持与现有工作流的兼容性，并进行性能测试。

Result: 开发的模块提升了PyKEEN的性能，并通过实验证明了高级负采样策略对知识图谱嵌入方法性能的正面影响。

Conclusion: 新开发的模块不仅增强了PyKEEN的功能，还为知识图谱嵌入方法的开发提供了便利和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Motivation: 当前强化学习用于多模态大语言模型的微调中存在效率低下的问题，主要原因是训练中出现了"优势崩塌"和"Rollout沉默"现象，导致梯度更新表现不佳与长时间学习效率受阻。

Method: 提出Shuffle-R1框架，包括（1）成对轨迹采样，选择高对比度并拥有较大优势的轨迹以提高梯度信号质量；（2）基于优势的轨迹重新洗牌，通过知情的批量重组增大有价值Rollout的曝光率。

Conclusion: 数据中心化适配在提高多模态大语言模型强化学习中的效率具有重要意义，Shuffle-R1框架是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

Conclusion: 开放式技术演化需要随机性和选择性因素共同作用，以维持技术系统有效性并持续扩展搜索空间和资源生产。

Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and
cumulatively improve technologies in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness
provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and
to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a
collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from
the interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of
interdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the
aggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting
from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological
systems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By
manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic
or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely
rare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and
search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to
continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas
selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained
production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains
effective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search
space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended
technological evolution.
