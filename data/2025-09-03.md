Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新型框架AMMKD，通过多模态特征融合、多教师蒸馏与自适应优化，开发轻量化但高效的图像-文本检索模型，以应对当前大规模预训练模型在移动设备上的部署挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模视觉语言预训练模型虽然成功，但受限于其模型规模和计算复杂性，难以在移动设备上广泛应用，亟需开发轻量化的高效检索模型。

Method: 本文提出AMMKD框架，包括特征融合网络用于提取图像和文本模态特征，多教师知识蒸馏框架通过预训练两个CLIP模型减少参数，并通过自适应动态权重调整优化多教师蒸馏的影响。

Result: 实验表明，AMMKD在三个基准数据集上表现优异，大幅降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: AMMKD框架在保证性能的前提下显著减少了复杂性，有效解决了大规模模型在移动设备上的部署难题。

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别由于其微妙和短暂的特性，传统输入方式难以充分捕捉微小面部动作，导致性能欠佳。

Method: 提出了一种新的输入模式MESTI，将视频序列转化为单张图像以保留关键特征；并设计了MEGANet网络，包含梯度注意力模块，用于提取微表情的细粒度运动特征。

Result: 实验表明，MESTI输入模式对比传统方法在多种CNN架构中表现更优，且结合MEGANet在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上实现了目前最高的准确率。

Conclusion: MESTI作为输入模式和MEGANet作为识别网络展现了其在微表情识别任务中的优越性，为相关应用的发展奠定了新基准。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Scaffold Diffusion，一种用于稀疏多类别3D体素结构的生成模型，通过将体素视为标记，利用离散扩散语言模型生成空间连贯的3D结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D体素生成的难点在于体素结构的内存需求呈立方增长以及稀疏性导致的类别不平衡，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用离散扩散语言模型，将体素视为标记，从而生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构。这种模型不仅限于顺序数据，还可以用于生成空间连贯的3D结构。

Result: 在3D-Craft数据集的Minecraft房屋结构上进行测试，结果显示Scaffold Diffusion比之前的基线方法和自回归模型生成更逼真且连贯的结构，即使训练数据的稀疏性超过98%。

Conclusion: 离散扩散是稀疏3D体素生成模型的一个有前途的框架，特别适用于高稀疏程度的数据集生成。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 此研究提出了SGLC框架，解决高分辨率图像去雾的问题，通过结合全局和局部特征，提升去雾表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去雾模型对高分辨率图像处理效果有限，因为难以结合全局情境信息与局部细节。

Method: 提出了SGLC框架，包括全局特征生成器(GFG)和局部特征增强器(LFE)，分别负责初步去雾和细节增强。

Result: 实验显示SGLC框架显著提升了PSNR值，证明其在高分辨率图像去雾中的有效性。

Conclusion: SGLC框架能增强任意去雾网络的性能，为高分辨率环境中的图像去雾提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了肾毒理病理的自动检测模型，通过158种化合物的研究，尝试使用自监督学习提高检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测肾脏异常是药物开发中的关键步骤，但费时费力且大多数图像为正常，因此需要开发高效的异常检测方法。

Method: 利用UNI基础模型提取特征，通过k近邻分类器和自监督学习方法进行异常检测，并对比其表现。

Result: 自监督学习方法比随机检测有更好的表现，ROC曲线下的面积为0.62，负预测值为89%。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于预筛选正常切片，降低药物开发的时间和资金成本。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于语义类别文本-图像检索的两步方法，通过生成扩散模型将文本转换为视觉查询，结合图像相似性评估和聚合网络优化实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型在文本和图像间存在较大的表征空间距离，影响了文本到图像检索的性能。

Method: 提出先通过生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，后通过融合图像间相似性及聚合网络改善检索结果的两步方法。

Result: 方法在多项评估中性能优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 证明了结合生成模型与视觉编码技术的混合策略在文本到图像检索中有效提升了性能。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出PRISM基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集，以评估和减少多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)中的生物识别信息泄露问题，通过细化的信息移除和评估标准设立隐私保护新标杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在处理视觉-语言任务时会意外泄露生物识别信息，如种族、性别等，但缺乏明确的评估工具或数据集对此问题进行系统研究，进而推动隐私保护。

Method: 提出PRISM基准，用于测量MLLMs拒绝生物识别相关问题和避免隐性泄露的能力。同时引入Safe-LLaVA数据集，该数据经过系统性地剥离生物识别信息，以支持隐私保护模型的训练与评估。

Result: 通过PRISM评估揭示MLLMs在不同属性上的生物识别泄露细节，并通过在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型，显著减少泄露问题。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA数据集与PRISM基准工具能够有效提升MLLMs的隐私保护能力，为隐私对齐的模型开发与监测提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型（VLMs）虽然在静态场景理解上表现出色，但在复杂任务的动态环境中，受限于对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解建模不足，仍难以实现类人推理能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为VEME的跨模态对齐方法，集成了三大核心组件：（1）跨模态对齐框架，结合对象、空间表示与视觉语义的时空线索增强VLM的上下文学习；（2）动态隐式认知地图，通过世界嵌入激活任务相关的几何语义记忆；（3）基于指令的导航与推理框架，利用具身先验进行长程规划与高效探索。

Conclusion: VEME通过几何感知的时空情景体验嵌入方法，增强了视觉-语言模型在复杂动态环境中的泛化能力，为实现具身智能的长远目标迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，用于提高乳腺叶状肿瘤的诊断准确性，减少不必要的手术切除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺叶状肿瘤在术前分类上因影像学与良性纤维腺瘤的相似性面临困难，导致许多不必要的手术切除。研究动机在于改进诊断方法以减少这种情况的发生。

Method: 提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，结合了乳腺超声图像和患者的临床数据。采用双分支神经网络，分别提取超声图像特征与患者元数据特征。通过类意识采样与分层5折交叉验证，避免类别不平衡和数据泄露问题。

Conclusion: 多模态AI展现了作为非侵入性诊断工具的潜力，有助于减少不必要的活检并改善乳腺肿瘤管理中的临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出$FHT2SP$算法，可在较低时间复杂度下保持高精度霍夫变换，适用于任意图像尺寸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有霍夫变换算法在计算复杂性（FHT类）和精度（高精度HT类）间存在矛盾，难以兼顾。

Method: 通过扩展Brady超级像素的概念，并将其整合到$FHT2DT$算法中，实现适用于任意形状图像的快速、高精度HT算法

Result: $FHT2SP$算法在时间复杂度为$\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$下实现了精度与图像尺寸无关，误差也可通过元参数调节。

Conclusion: 实验与理论分析表明，$FHT2SP$算法兼具高效与高精度特性，优于当前多数HT算法。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

*Liang Gong,Tommy,Wang,Sara Chaker,Yanchen Dong,Fouad Bousetouane,Brenden Morton,Mark Mendez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种语言引导的工业视觉系统，用于精确检测制造中的残余轮廓。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的边缘检测器在面对噪声、材料变化和不受控的成像条件时效果不佳，因此需要新的方法来提高检测准确性，以达到CAD级别的精度。

Method: 系统分为三个阶段：数据获取与预处理、基于条件GAN的轮廓生成，以及结合视觉和语言模型的多模态轮廓优化，其中优化通过标准化的提示词和人类参与的流程实现。

Result: 在专有数据集上的实验表明，该系统提升了轮廓的复原度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，同时减少了人工标注工作。在对一些视觉语言模型进行比较时，GPT-image-1在结构精度和感知质量上优于Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的生成性工作流展现出突破传统工业视觉系统局限性的重要潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在基础视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中应用传递式少样本学习（transductive few-shot learning）的可能性，并提出了名为LIMO的高效方法，使用了信息论概念和参数高效微调（PEFT），显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉模型中传递式少样本学习取得了一些进展，但在视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中的研究仍处于起步阶段，亟需针对VLMs的专门方法和探索。

Method: 提出了一个新的损失函数LIMO，包括三部分：视觉输入与文本类描述的互信息、网络输出与文本驱动的零样本预测的KL散度，以及基于标签样本的标准交叉熵损失；并探讨了常被忽视的参数高效微调（PEFT）策略。

Result: LIMO方法在传递式少样本学习中显著超越了最近的方法，并显著优于当前最佳的归纳式方法。

Conclusion: 通过信息论与PEFT策略，LIMO极大提升了传递式少样本学习在基础视觉-语言模型中的表现，展现出对模型参数子集进行微调的潜力。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过提出MorphGen方法，解决数字病理学领域中因图像跨域偏移问题导致的模型推广性差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的计算病理学模型在处理不同机构的全切片图像时表现不佳，原因在于组织准备、染色和成像条件的差异。研究旨在通过借鉴病理学家利用与领域无关的形态学诊断线索，从而提高模型在不同领域的推广性。

Method: 提出了一种名为MorphGen的方法，将病理影像、图像增强和核分割掩码在对比学习框架中整合，同时加入随机权重平均(SWA)优化，使得模型更加稳定。

Result: 通过定位诊断特征如核形态和空间组织，MorphGen展现了对图像失真、域偏移及对抗攻击的鲁棒性，显著提升了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过专注于生物学上稳健的形态学特征，使得深度学习系统在数字病理领域表现优异，为解决跨域问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Chenrui He,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉token裁剪方法，在维持强性能的同时，大幅减少token数量和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大型多模态模型在推理时由于token数量的增加，面临计算和内存成本大幅增加的问题。现有的token裁剪方法效果有限，因此需要更有效的方案。

Method: 提出基于视觉token的裁剪策略，结合信息互联和表示多样性，利用互信息方法去除语义未对齐的视觉token，并通过优化嵌入空间中的距离进一步删减冗余token。

Result: 提出的方法在保留强性能的情况下，将token减少了88.9%，推理速度提升了56.7%。

Conclusion: 通过改善视觉token裁剪策略，可以有效降低多模态模型的计算和内存成本，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究主要关注提高融合性能，但忽略了实时设备的适用性。本文希望在性能与设备适配性上找到平衡点，提出足够快速且适用性强的解决方案。

Method: 设计一利用低阶近似编码和场景上下文编码的查找表架构，并利用高效的LUT蒸馏策略取代传统量化方法，结合多模态网络性能进行模型优化。

Conclusion: LUT-Fuse在性能和效率上表现优异，研究证实其可靠性和稳定性，为多模态图像融合领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 单域泛化任务中，模型在分布变化下表现较差，现有方法没有利用目标环境的文本描述资源。

Method: 提出TO-SDG问题框架，利用VLM模型嵌入文本语义，通过STAR模块重新对齐特征，结合光谱投影与特征空间混合等技术强化跨域泛化能力。

Result: 在多个分类和目标检测基准上，STAR模块展现出显著优越的能力。

Conclusion: 利用目标域的文本描述信息是一种高效且被忽视的提升模型鲁棒性的方法，可在数据受限情况下实现更优的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Abstract: Air pollution monitoring in resource-constrained regions remains challenging
due to sparse sensor deployment and limited infrastructure. This work
introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air

atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN
backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features
are combined through semantically aligned embedding spaces, enabling accurate

achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the
EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over
single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making
it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and
practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments,
offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.

Motivation: 高光谱图像通常存在于低维子空间中，利用低秩和稀疏表示进行去噪同时保持图像细节具有挑战性。

Method: ILRNet将模型驱动与数据驱动的方法相结合，在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块，通过将特征图变换至小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值，从而捕获光谱的低秩特性。

Conclusion: ILRNet通过迭代优化与参数自适应学习，可以灵活有效地处理不同场景下的低秩性，进而逐步提升去噪效果并优异地保留图像细节。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: SurgLLM显著提升了手术视频的理解能力，是计算机辅助手术系统发展的重要进展。

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Conclusion: 研究表明当前物体幻觉研究的关键盲点，并且为开发更稳健和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指出了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型虽然在视觉与文本信息整合方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击非常脆弱。现有的防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示，效果有限且可能影响视觉定位能力，因此需要更通用和高效的防御方法。

Method: 提出的SPO-VLM框架包括两个阶段：第一阶段，通过从多样化数据中计算自适应的层特定方向向量，以抑制有害行为；第二阶段，通过整合自动化毒性评估和基于图文一致性的奖励进行方向向量优化，实现安全且语义一致的文本生成。

Result: 实验表明，SPO-VLM在对抗攻击下通过激活引导及偏好优化增强了安全性，并且不会影响模型在正常任务上的性能和视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过两阶段方法在提升模型对抗攻击鲁棒性的同时，保持强大的视觉理解性能，为未来的研究及安全性改进提供了开源支持。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

### [29] [Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning: Fine-Tuning Heterogeneous Foundation Models for 3D Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00374)
*Mengke Li,Lihao Chen,Peng Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于3D点云分析的参数高效微调方法，即APPT（Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning），解决了通过“高到低”映射方法带来的空间几何丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前利用预训练模型进行3D点云分析面临着数据稀缺和映射方法的局限性，该论文希望开发一种更通用且保留空间几何信息的方法。

Method: 提出了APPT方法，通过局部几何聚合和线性层将原始点云转为点嵌入，并使用对位置无关的特征捕获点的相对位置。在此基础上，设计了一个共享权重的动态提示生成器，将点提示整合到冻结的基础模型中。

Result: 该方法能够在无需异构映射的情况下高效微调预训练模型，并优化了3D点云的自注意机制。

Conclusion: APPT方法提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，进一步扩展了预训练模型在3D点云领域中的应用范围，同时保留了空间几何和结构信息。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

*Shumpei Takezaki,Ryoma Bise,Shinnosuke Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为NoiseCutMix的新型数据增强方法，将CutMix理念引入扩散模型，生成自然且高分辨率的融合图像，用于分类实验显示其效果优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法如CutMix和MixUp在结合多类别特征时容易导致图像之间的边界不自然，因此需要更高质量的生成方式来提升图像分类任务的效果。

Method: 提出的新方法NoiseCutMix利用扩散模型部分混合不同类别的估计噪声，生成融合了两类特征的自然高分辨率图像。

Result: 通过与传统混合类别数据增强技术、随机图像生成及其组合的对比实验验证了新方法的有效性。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix方法展示出在生成自然且高分辨率的融合图像方面的优越性，为改进图像分类任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

TL;DR: 传统语义分割方法需要大量带注释的3D点云数据，成本高昂，而通过跨模态知识蒸馏，本研究用2D图像数据指导3D点云语义分割，减少了3D注释的需求并超越了现有方法效果。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为NAME的新范式，用于将研究文档转化为连贯的故事图像；通过新的模块和评价指标显著优化了图像生成质量及叙事一致性，同时以极少的数据量实现了优于传统方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 本研究的NAME方法有效减轻了叙事生成中研究者与参与者的认知负担，并以低资源需求提供了卓越的图像生成与叙事一致性表现，为叙事研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

TL;DR: 该研究提出HERO-VQL方法，通过TAG和EgoACT技术改善视觉查询定位，尤其在VQ2D数据集上的表现显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理自我视角视频中的频繁视点变化以及随之带来的对象外观变化和部分遮挡时表现较差，因此需要开发能够应对此类挑战的新方法。

Method: 通过Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG)引导注意力，利用类标记和主成分得分图精炼上下文与细粒度定位。同时引入Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT)，利用增强多样性和模拟极端视点变化来提升模型的定位能力。

Result: HERO-VQL方法在VQ2D数据集上的性能显著提升，并击败了多种基准方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL利用符合人类认知的策略和一致性训练技术，有效应对了自我视角中的视觉查询定位挑战，取得了显著的成果。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种双约束扩散模型（DCDM），用于超低剂量PET图像重建，减少辐射并提高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET虽能降低辐射剂量，但可能增加噪声并降低成像细节，影响图像质量。

Method: DCDM通过冻结预训练扩散模型的权重，并在其编码结构注入双约束控制器，包含核变压器约束（NTC）和编码枢纽约束（ENC），减少可训练参数并增强适应性。

Result: 在UDPET公开数据集和临床数据集上实验显示，DCDM优于现有方法，能在已知及未知剂量降低因子（DRF）场景下实现出色的图像重建，即使在1%的超低剂量下亦表现出色。

Conclusion: DCDM显著提升了超低剂量PET的重建图像质量，具备强通用性，能适应不同剂量水平，展示了临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于全景视频修复的新型深度学习模型DAOVI，解决了广视场带来的失真问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法多针对窄视场视频，无法有效处理全景视频在等矩形投影下的失真问题。

Method: 提出了DAOVI模型，引入了空间中基于测地距离的时间运动信息评估模块和特征空间中针对几何失真的深度感知特征传播模块。

Result: 实验表明，DAOVI方法在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI有效解决了全景视频修复中的失真问题，为全景视频处理提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 近年来方法在捕捉动态细节或生成合理新视角细节方面表现有限，其主要原因是化身模型的表达能力不足及观察数据的缺乏。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成新视角监督信号和结合多种增强策略，显著改善了化身重建表现。

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LightVLM的方法，通过在视觉-语言模型(VLMs)的编码和解码两个阶段进行优化，从而在无需重新训练的情况下显著加速推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对现有VLMs在推理时的效率瓶颈，实现更快速的模型推理。

Method: 通过分层的金字塔式令牌合并方法优化编码阶段，并利用KV缓存压缩技术优化解码阶段，从而同时提升VLM的效率。

Result: 实验表明，在保留较少图像令牌时（如仅3%令牌），性能几乎不下降，同时能实现推理速度提升2.02倍、预填充时间减少3.65倍。在生成长序列文本时，推理时间缩短了3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM显著提升了大规模视觉-语言模型的推理效率，在性能几乎无损的情况下实现了更快的推理速度，展现出良好的实用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Conclusion: SemaMIL不仅能够更有效地提取WSIs中的判别特征，还在计算效率和解释性上具有优势。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,

TL;DR: 本论文提出了首个综合性视频理解多模态奖励模型（MRMs）基准VideoRewardBench，用于评估视频领域MRMs的能力，并发现现有模型存在明显性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态奖励模型评估基准在视频领域中存在问题，包括问题数量与多样性不足、评估维度不全面以及对多种类型的MRMs缺乏有效评估。

Method: 通过AI辅助的数据处理流程，创建了高质量偏好数据集，包括1,563个注释样本，并提出了涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个核心方面的综合性评估框架，同时对28种多模态奖励模型进行了全面评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是最顶尖的GPT-4o模型整体准确率仅达57.0%，而开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究还揭示了强化学习训练的MRMs不一定具有更强的跨模态泛化能力等关键洞察。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为推动视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了一个具有挑战性且价值重大的基准。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对视频数据中群体活动检索的难题，提出了一种新的时空交织视频哈希（STVH）技术，并进一步推出了改进版的多焦点时空视频哈希（M-STVH），在多个公开数据集上均取得了优秀效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸性增长，高效检索群体活动成为一个迫切的问题。此外，现有方法主要关注于整个视频，无法基于活动粒度进行检索。

Method: 提出了一种新的时空交织视频哈希技术（STVH），在统一框架下建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉群体的视觉特征和位置特征的时空演化。同时，为应对实际检索需求，研发了改进版的多焦点时空视频哈希（M-STVH），引入多焦点表示学习，以联合聚焦活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 通过在多个公开数据集上的对比实验发现，STVH和M-STVH均表现出优异的检索效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法能有效实现基于活动粒度的视频检索，改进版的多焦点技术具备更强的特征融合能力，适应不同场景需求，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于超声图像的无配对图像翻译方法（TRUST），通过双流框架和token驱动模块减小设备间图像风格差异对下游任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声图像因不同设备风格多样性导致的下游任务性能下降问题。

Method: 提出TRUST框架，包括双流结构及Token-dRiven模块，通过数据视角选择适合的目标token，以及模型视角优化目标token。此外，还在源编码器中引入辅助提示以匹配内容表征。

Result: 在超声数据集上，TRUST的视觉质量和下游任务表现均优于现有无配对图像翻译方法。

Conclusion: TRUST能够实现内容与风格分离，有效提升跨设备超声图像下游任务性能。

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能服务的普及，用黑盒模型训练本地模型的问题愈加突出，现有领域自适应方法无法应对这些限制条件。

Method: 提出了一种名为ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC) 的方法，利用DINOv2注意力图动态选择最佳输入分辨率，结合伪标注有效蒸馏黑盒模型知识。

Result: 实验表明，通过ATGC方法对黑盒模型的一次性输出进行监督，可以在多个数据集上获得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在仅通过有限黑盒API输出的约束下，ATGC是一种有效的适配方法，推动了AI服务领域更广泛的应用。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

TL;DR: 提出了解决在Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation（CISS）中语义灾难性纠缠问题的新框架，通过语言模型辅助实现语义解纠缠，并在复杂场景下取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉特征学习中缺乏有效区分目标的线索，导致严重的噪声和错误，需要提出新的方法应对语义错误纠缠问题。

Method: 提出Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement (LBD)框架，引入预训练的视觉-语言模型如CLIP，通过语言引导新的原型信息分离以及背景增量解纠缠。方法还包括软提示调优和编码器自适应，用于弥补CLIP在密集和稀疏任务间的能力差异。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上取得了最先进的性能，尤其在多步骤场景测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于语言指导的语义解纠缠框架LBD有效改善了在Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation场景中的解决方案，展示了其综合性能优势。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在校准的医疗成像中表现出色，但在非校准模态（如磁共振成像）中泛化能力不足，限制了其在现实临床中的广泛应用。

Method: 该研究提出了一个名为BrainFM的模态无关、多任务的视觉基础模型，并创新性地引入“轻微到严重”的主体内部生成和“真实-合成”混合训练策略，使其能够适应图像采集的各种变化。

Result: BrainFM在五种基本脑成像任务（包括图像合成、解剖分割、头皮到皮层距离、偏置场估计和配准）中具有稳健和高效的表现，实验覆盖了11个公开数据集。

Conclusion: BrainFM成功克服了成像模态和内容变化带来的挑战，展示了其在不同任务和输入模态下的强大鲁棒性和有效性，为临床应用的广泛性提供了可能性。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细粒度目标检测中上下文相关场景中的局限性，提高车辆损伤评估等领域的检测性能。

Method: 提出上下文感知融合（CAF）方法，结合交叉注意力机制，通过单独的编码器生成全局上下文信息，与局部提议特征相融合，使每个目标提议能够利用场景级理解进行检测。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的框架在CarDD基准测试中优于最新的模型，设立了新的性能标杆。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过上下文感知融合机制显著提升了细粒度领域的生成检测性能，为车辆等细粒度目标检测树立了新的基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Method: 提出了一种无训练的DGL-RSIS框架：采用全局-局部解耦模块，将文本输入分为局部类别名词和全局修饰符，图像输入则分割为无类别标记的掩码提案；匹配增强文本特征与掩码引导的图像特征以实现开集语义分割；通过跨尺度Grad-CAM模块整合全局上下文信息进行掩码级别优化。

Result: 框架通过全局与局部级别的视觉-语言对齐策略，在开集语义分割和表达式分割中展示了良好的性能与适用性。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架成功实现了遥感图像开集语义分割任务，展示了融合视觉与语言特征的潜力，并为遥感领域提供了一种新颖的无训练策略。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了多视图三维人体姿态估计的泛化能力，使其在新配置的相机下可保持卓越性能。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于选择-调整-保持（STM）策略的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，用于恶劣天气下单目深度估计，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件如雨、雾、雪和夜晚下的单目深度估计挑战大，现有方法受限于领域间差异或不适合的假设，难以利用未标记的真实世界数据有效学习。

Method: 通过构建选择-调整-保持（STM）策略，结构性对视觉基础模型（VFMs）的预训练权重进行分解，利用熵秩和稳定秩选择合适的秩和初始化方向，并通过正则化保持主要方向，确保在高可见性数据下灵活适配任务并保留预训练模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在四个不同天气条件的真实世界基准数据集上，STM显著超越了现有PEFT方法和全量微调方法，并超过了使用恶劣天气合成数据及深度基础模型训练的方法。

Conclusion: STM策略高效平衡了任务适配与泛化能力，是恶劣天气深度估计任务中的一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过将偏好标注的评价数据集转换为训练信号，直接在生成模型上进行强化学习，生成了LLaVA-Critic-R1，一个在保留生成能力的同时优化偏好判断的多模态评价模型，表现出顶级的评价和政策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视听语言模型中，评价与生成分离导致评价模型很少用于直接的政策生成，本研究试图打破这一传统，通过将评价数据用于训练生成模型，探索其潜力。

Method: 将评价数据重新组织为可验证的训练信号，并将其用于生成模型的强化学习训练，生成多模态评价模型LLaVA-Critic-R1，同时保持生成和推理能力。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级的评价模型，还具备与专门训练的推理模型相匹敌的政策生成能力，甚至在多项视觉推理任务中超越原有模型。此外，自我批评方法在推理时显著提升了性能，平均提高+13.8%。

Conclusion: RL在评价数据上的训练不仅能统一生成与评价功能，还能通过简单途径实现多模态系统的可扩展性和自我改进能力，为该领域提供新方向。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba)的新网络，用于远程感知图像分类，其特点是将低计算需求的Mamba方法与CNN结合，设计跨状态模块以实现多模态特征融合，并证明了其在实验中优于Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓解现有深度学习方法在处理更长距离空间光谱特征交互时的计算负担，并充分融合多模态特征。

Method: 结合Mamba和CNN设计了一个新的架构CSFMamba，并设计了一个基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块，同时优化了图像预处理模块和特征提取骨干网络结构。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上实现了相较Transformer更低计算负担下的优越性能。

Conclusion: CSFMamba展示了结合计算优化和多模态特征融合的新设计的潜力，在远程感知图像分类任务中显著改善性能。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Method: 提出了CascadeFormer，包括掩码预训练阶段和级联微调阶段，用于学习可泛化的骨架表示和针对性动作分类。

Result: 在Penn Action、N-UCLA和NTU RGB+D 60三个基准数据集上获得了竞争性能。

Conclusion: CascadeFormer具有较高的性能潜力，并开放了代码和模型以促进可重复性研究。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估视觉-语言模型中投影层泛化能力的基准，并通过实验分析了其在未见概念上的性能以及内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言模型组合了视觉编码器和大规模语言模型，但其投影层对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未被系统性评估。

Method: 设计了一套基准，通过将目标检测数据集转换为提示格式并设置不相交的标签集训练/测试分割，从而可以精确控制已见与未见概念的分离。

Result: 实验表明，在未显式对这些概念进行对齐监督的情况下，投影层在未见类别上的性能可保留于已见类别的79%至88%。

Conclusion: 结果展示了投影层具有非平凡的泛化能力，同时提出了一种新的对齐泛化评估框架，为在有限对齐数据下实现高效VLM训练提供了可能性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度学习提高皮肤病变分类效果，但对皮肤颜色的潜在偏见仍引起了对公平性的担忧。因此，研究的动机是改善诊断公平性。

Method: 通过计算VGG网络卷积层的特征图偏度、Vision Transformer的patch与head，减少与肤色相关的无关通道，专注于病变区域。

Result: 该方法能够降低计算成本，减少偏差，同时潜在减少模型尺寸，提高公平性。

Conclusion: 此研究为实际医疗应用提供了一种更高效、更公平的解决方案，有助于在复杂环境下实现公平诊断。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的方法CaFE，用于解释视觉变换器中稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的因果驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过查看特征激活最高的图像区块来了解SAE特征代表的内容，但这种方法可能会因注意力机制混合信息而导致误判。研究动机是提供更因果、精确的解释途径。

Method: 基于有效感受野（ERF），该方法结合输入归因技术，识别图像中对SAE特征激活具有因果驱动作用的区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，相较基于激活排名的方法，CaFE能有效恢复或抑制特征激活，揭示特征激活的隐藏上下文依赖性。

Conclusion: CaFE能够产生更忠实且语义精确的SAE特征解释，表明仅依赖激活位置可能导致误解。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言检索方法在面对抽象事件、因果关系、时间语境或复杂叙述的情况下往往表现不足，亟需解决。

Method: 研究者提出了一个多阶段检索框架，包括密集文章检索、事件感知语言模型的重新排序、语义匹配及多模态信息融合等步骤，采用多个Qwen模型协同工作。

Result: 系统在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge的Track 2比赛的私有测试集中取得了顶尖成绩。

Conclusion: 论文展示了结合语言推理与多模态检索能够有效应对复杂的图像理解问题，公开的代码有助于更广泛的数据科学研究。

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the

Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法缓解了“有毒兄弟”偏差问题，并显著提升了人-物体交互检测的精度，为进一步的研究与应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images

*Ganxi Xu,Jinyi Long,Jia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图像到脑信号生成框架，利用增强的扩散概率模型，通过动态交互提取和还原生物学上合理的脑信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉假体技术难以生成具有充分生物相似性的脑信号，导致预测刺激的质量问题仍未解决。

Method: 提出一种基于去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）和跨注意力机制的图像到脑信号框架，结合预训练CLIP视觉编码器和增强的U-Net扩散模型，推动视觉特征与脑信号更精细的对齐。

Result: 通过THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG数据集验证了框架的有效性，并展示了脑电图数据显示的被试内及被试间的变化情况。

Conclusion: 新框架在生成生物学合理的脑信号方面效果显著，为视觉假体的进一步发展提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出OmniReason框架，解决现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶场景中忽略时间维度的问题，通过联合建模动态三维环境和决策过程，实现稳健的时空推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要聚焦于静态场景理解，忽视了真实世界驾驶场景中的关键时间维度。本研究旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出OmniReason框架，包括两个部分：1）OmniReason-Data数据集，通过新颖的标注管线生成，保证物理合理性和时间一致性；2）OmniReason-Agent架构，结合稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，利用时空知识蒸馏方法进行时空因果推理。

Result: 实验表明OmniReason-Agent在开放式规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中表现出色，同时实现了解释性和时间感知能力，适用于复杂动态环境的自动驾驶。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架显著提升了视觉语言模型的时空推理和解释能力，为动态环境下的自动驾驶提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MI-RAG的框架，通过多次迭代提升多模态知识检索和推理能力，显著改善知识密集型视觉问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问题解答中表现有限，而单次检索生成框架（RAG）的传统方法难以获取足够知识。

Method: 提出了一种新的多模态迭代RAG（MI-RAG）框架，通过动态多查询和跨模态推理，结合异质知识库中视觉与文本知识，多次迭代更新推理记录，并优化知识检索和理解过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，MI-RAG在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等复杂基准任务上显著提高了检索召回率和回答准确率。

Conclusion: MI-RAG证明了一种可扩展的知识密集型视觉问答组合推理方法，为此类任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态语义引导3D高斯点方法，用于深海场景重建，能够在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于光线扭曲、浊度和能见度有限等问题，当前水下环境中的3D重建仍然面临着复杂挑战，而现有基于AI的方法尚未充分利用AI的潜力，特别是在语言模型与视觉处理的整合方面。

Method: 引入了一种新的框架，通过多模态交叉知识，创建语义引导的3D高斯点方法。通过在每个高斯原语中嵌入额外的语义特征并由CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，同时应用语义一致性损失确保高级场景理解的一致性。此外，采用新的分阶段训练策略，结合粗到细的学习和晚期参数优化提升质量。

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上表现优异，在PSNR指标上平均提升高达3.09 dB，超越现有顶尖方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在提高深海环境下的3D重建稳健性和保真度方面表现优异，是水下探索和海洋感知应用的强有力候选。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应对比度调节模块（ACAM），实现胎儿超声成像标准平面分类的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决胎儿超声成像中低组织对比度、边界模糊和操作员依赖性图像质量问题。

Method: 通过一个浅层纹理敏感网络预测对比度参数，生成多种对比增强视图，并在下游分类器中进行融合。

Result: 模块在多中心数据集上验证有效，轻量级模型的准确率增加了2.02%，传统模型增加1.29%，前沿模型增加1.15%。

Conclusion: ACAM通过内容感知自适应增强和多视图融合，提高了医学图像分析的鲁棒性，适用于实际超声成像质量差异场景。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM)的新型梯度攻击方法，在提高攻击性能和成本效益上超过了现有方法，并能够结合对抗训练提升防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法的性能和运行成本需要改进，以更好地评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出三层优化框架“cycle-stage-step”，同时引入DPDR损失函数，通过压缩无关标签概率逐步提升非真实标签的概率上限。

Result: 实验表明，SDM方法在攻击性能和攻击成本效益上优于以往方法，同时能增强对抗训练的防御效果。

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效且有效的对抗攻击方法，不仅具有优越的攻击效果，还能通过结合对抗训练提高模型的防御能力。

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Motivation: 提升纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在噪声干扰环境下。

Method: 采用U-Net局部特征训练与Vision Transformer (ViT) 全局处理相结合的方法，并利用高斯滤波损失函数和盐与椒(SP)掩模支持模型训练，通过Gabor滤波器后处理进一步强调缺陷的方向和频率特性。

Result: 模型在MVTec-AD、表面裂纹检测和大理石表面异常数据集上实现了平均AUC为0.939的性能。

Conclusion: 实验表明，适当的滤波器参数和噪声概率对提升检测性能尤为关键，该方法在多种纹理数据集上的表现验证了其效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一优化框架，通过将相机姿态作为可学习参数，与3D高斯属性相结合进行端到端优化，从而提高因动态模糊导致的三维场景重建失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在单目视频的动态三维场景重建中，运动模糊常导致相机姿态估计错误，累积误差使重建效果恶化，因此需要一种能够缓解模糊影响的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种统一优化框架，将相机姿态定义为3D高斯转换的SE(3)仿射变换，并设计一个三阶段训练方案：1）固定姿态优化3D高斯；2）固定3D高斯优化姿态；3）联合优化所有可学习参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实复杂场景上进行实验，结果显示本方法在重建质量和姿态估计精度方面明显优于现有动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 这种方法表明，通过端到端优化相机姿态和3D高斯，可以有效解决由于动态模糊导致的三维场景重建问题，并在实际场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Motivation: 现有方法虽然可以适应DINO的分割任务，但通常需训练复杂的解码器或多尺度融合流程，导致模型规模和算力成本过高。

Method: 提出SegDINO框架，冻结DINOv3作为特征提取主干，利用轻量级解码器对多层特征进行对齐并通过MLP进行分割预测，以减少训练参数。

Result: SegDINO在包含医学和自然图像的六个基准数据集上均取得了领先的分割性能。

Conclusion: SegDINO证明了基础视觉模型冻结网络与轻量级解码器结合的方式，是一种高效且性能优异的分割设计。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Conclusion: 研究证明了SUFERNOBWA框架在去除大气干扰、保持卫星图像结构一致性的强大能力，并展示了其在遥感领域中广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新方法，用于通过分解单视图NVS成360度场景外推和新视图插值来实现一致性和全局连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在长距离或闭环轨迹中保证视图一致性和正确对齐，因此需要改进方法以提高全局一致性和灵活性。

Method: 方法分为两阶段：首先通过全景扩散模型学习场景属性；其次，以经过全景图变换的关键帧为锚点，通过视频扩散模型生成新视图，采用改进空间噪声扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成的视图更具连贯性，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文方法在提升单视图NVS的一致性和灵活性方面具备显著优势。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Motivation: 当前量化感知训练方法关注于I.D数据上的性能而忽视OOD数据上的退化问题，作者通过实验验证了问题的存在并剖析了其原因。

Method: 提出了一种面向平坦度的量化感知训练方法（FQAT），包括层级冻结机制和无序引导的自适应冻结算法，通过动态冻结训练中不稳定的层，缓解了平坦性和量化优化目标之间的矛盾。

Result: 在重要的OOD基准上进行的实验表明，FQAT方法在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上的表现超越了目前的最先进基线。

Conclusion: 通过提出FQAT方法，本文有效改善了量化感知训练在OOD数据上的性能退化问题，为提升深度学习模型的泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Conclusion: 基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查是一种具有临床解释性的新方法，公开的数据集和代码为进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: DarkVRAI通过结合条件方案和BOSS机制，在低光视频降噪任务中达到了领先性能，并在相关基准数据集上树立了新标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光视频传感器因高增益和短曝光时间导致的信号降解问题。

Method: 1) 引入基于捕捉元数据的条件方案；2) 提出BOSS机制用于建模长距离时间依赖性。

Result: DarkVRAI在AIM 2025低光RAW视频降噪挑战中获得第一名，并在基准数据集上展现最优状态表现。

Conclusion: DarkVRAI有效提升了低光视频降噪的性能，树立了新的行业标准。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为增量补丁生成（IPG）的新方法，可以比现有方法快11.1倍生成对抗性补丁，同时保持类似的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统对抗性样本和对抗性补丁在计算机视觉领域的实际威胁，提升AI模型的鲁棒性是该研究的动机。

Method: 利用增量生成策略快速生成对抗性补丁，并通过YOLO特征分布可视化及对抗训练实验验证了方法的有效性。

Result: IPG方法生成的补丁覆盖更广泛的模型脆弱性，并为构建强健模型提供数据集基础，在多场景中表现出优越性。

Conclusion: IPG方法不仅在对抗性补丁防御方面具有潜力，还可应用于自动驾驶、安全系统和医疗成像等领域，对AI安全生态具有实际意义。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

*Xiangchen Wang,Jinrui Zhang,Teng Wang,Haigang Zhang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出LangDC，一种动态的语言感知令牌压缩器，用于提高视频理解任务的效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频-语言模型由于需要处理大量视觉令牌而效率低下，现有固定压缩比的策略未能考虑视频语义密度的变化，导致对信息丰富片段的表达不足以及不必要的计算。

Method: 提出了LangDC，它通过一个轻量级语言模型，将视频段落转化为软字幕令牌作为视觉表示，并利用语义密度感知监督进行训练，以动态调整压缩比率，模拟人类对场景复杂度的动态表达。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+，LangDC减少了49%的FLOPs，且在性能上保持竞争力。此外，定性结果显示该方法能够自适应地根据视频片段的丰富性调整压缩比。

Conclusion: LangDC提供了一种更高效且动态的方式进行视频语义表示的压缩，为视频理解任务开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将多光谱影像（包括红、绿、红边和近红外）与RGB影像整合入3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）框架，用于快速高保真的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱影像的数据融合在3D重建中潜力巨大，但目前的直接方法在多谱段优化时产生了几何不一致性问题。

Method: 分析了三种策略：单独重建、不共享结构；先优化RGB几何，再逐一优化其他波段；以及联合优化。提出将多光谱数据直接整合至球谐颜色组件以紧凑建模。

Result: 通过量化指标和定性可视化展示，优化的联合策略显著提升了光谱重建性能，同时通过光谱交互增强了RGB重建效果。

Conclusion: 建议直接将多光谱数据融入光谱反射建模中，并对引入光谱带的时机和方式提出重要实用见解，有助于稳健的多模态3DGS重建。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Motivation: 了解驾驶员在雨天情况下如何通过目光行为适应，以改进驾驶员监控系统和辅助驾驶系统。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法：首先对10秒间隔内的注视点聚类；然后将聚类中心合并为元聚类，并结合马尔可夫转移矩阵及其他注视指标分析行为变化。

Result: 发现雨天条件下驾驶员有更多的仪表盘注视、更长的凝视时间和较高的目光高度，反映出了在不良条件下认知上的增强集中。

Conclusion: 目光行为模式可为设计更高级的驾驶员辅助系统提供指导，为恶劣驾驶条件下的视觉注意模式研究提供了有价值的洞见。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider方法有效解决了多属性控制中的干扰问题，实现了可靠、独立的多属性操控，同时降低计算复杂度，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于依赖合成数据或雨滴污染的图像修复，而真实环境中的玻璃污染问题种类多样（如泥水、灰尘等），缺乏适合的方法与数据支持。

Method: 本文收集真实污染和清洁图像对，提出了一个集成模型，利用自监督辅助学习任务，通过测试时的一次性适配机制调整模型以适应不同污染类型。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在清除真实并未见过的污染图像方面，定量和定性均优于最新技术方法。

Conclusion: 基于真实数据和适应机制的模型能有效修复多种类型的玻璃污染图像，展现了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为LPFM的统一低级病理基础模型，用于解决病理图像中的降质问题，并可处理图像恢复（如超分辨率、去模糊和去噪）和图像翻译任务（如虚拟染色）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在高端诊断任务上表现出色，但对低级图像增强问题关注较少。现实病理图像由于物理染色、制片等原因，常伴随噪声、模糊等问题，现有方法也缺乏普适性，难以应对实际的多种低级视觉挑战。

Method: 提出LPFM模型，包含对比预训编码器，通过190百万无标签病理图像学习可转移的染色不变特征表示，同时利用统一条件扩散过程，通过文本提示动态适配特定任务。模型训练在包含87,810个切片图像、涉及34种组织类型和5种染色协议的数据集上进行。

Result: LPFM在大多数任务（56/66）中优于最新方法，图像恢复方面，峰值信噪比（PSNR）提高10-15%；虚拟染色方面，结构相似性指数（SSIM）提高12-18%。

Conclusion: LPFM通过统一的架构，有效提升图像质量和任务性能，是低级病理图像任务的革命性进展。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Conclusion: SpectMamba結合空間與頻率特徵，並改進模型架構，在醫學影像檢測中提供了更好的精度與效率，是一個具有潛力的創新方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为双向稀疏注意力（BSA）的框架，显著加速了视频扩散Transformer（DiT）的训练，同时保持甚至提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer在生成质量上表现出色，但其高分辨率、长视频生成的训练和推理成本由于全注意力的二次复杂度而变得非常高效。

Method: 通过动态稀疏化查询（Query）和键值（Key-Value）对的3D全注意力，提出了双向稀疏注意力（BSA）框架，其中包含两个关键组件：优化查询稀疏性和通过动态阈值方法优化键值稀疏性。

Result: BSA显著加快了DiT的训练时间，减少了高达20倍的浮点运算，并实现了17.79倍的加速，同时仍能保持甚至提升生成质量。

Conclusion: BSA是一种有效的方法，用于在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升DiT的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Conclusion: VEPE通过端到端设计解决了现有方法在效率和全局上下文利用方面的局限性，为视频姿态估计任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: PVINet通过高效特征交互与提取实现了更高质量的点云压缩重构，展现了较强的竞争力。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率驱动的上下文解耦，显著改进了降解场景下的图像生成性能，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

### [98] [GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01109)
*Zhengqiang Zhang,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了GPSToken，一种新的基于高斯参数化的空间自适应分块框架，用于实现非均匀图像分块，能够动态建模图像区域形状、位置和纹理特性并进行有效的特征提取及生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于统一网格的图像分块方法难以灵活表示形状和纹理各异的区域，限制了特征表示能力，因此需要更灵活有效的图像分块方式。

Method: GPSToken通过熵驱动算法将图像划分为纹理同质的区域，并使用高斯分布参数化区域的形状与位置；训练特定的Transformer优化高斯参数，同时使用差分渲染器将高斯参数化的标记重建为二维特征图，实现端到端训练。

Result: GPSToken在图像重建和生成任务中，基于128个标记分别达成rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken能够解耦空间布局与纹理特征，支持两阶段的高效生成，证明了其先进的性能和潜力。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MetaSSL的通用框架，通过空间异质性损失函数优化半监督学习中的像素加权，从而提高医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望减少医学图像分割中的标注成本，并解决现有方法忽视标注噪声及未标注像素异质性的问题。

Method: 设计了一个统一框架MetaSSL，采用空间异质性损失函数，根据预测结果的不确定性和一致性，对像素赋予不同权重，同时定义了四种区域（UC, US, DC, DS）进行加权计算，并引入自适应阈值区分置信像素和可疑像素。

Result: 与现有SSL框架结合后，MetaSSL在多个数据集上的分割性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MetaSSL方法可作为现有半监督学习方法的通用增强模块，有效提高性能并兼顾标注噪声挑战。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MVTrajecter的方法，通过使用多时间戳信息改进了多视图行人跟踪（MVPT）的精度，优于之前的最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MVPT方法仅使用单一时间戳的运动和外观信息，忽略了较长时间跨度的轨迹信息，因此无法充分利用历史数据进行准确跟踪。

Method: 提出了一种基于多时间戳轨迹信息的MVTrajecter模型，该模型通过引入轨迹运动代价和外观代价，结合注意力机制捕获多时间戳间的关系，提高了关联的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验验证表明，MVTrajecter在多个组件有效性的支撑下，性能优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过综合利用多时间戳信息提升了行人关联的准确性，为MVPT领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频理解依赖采样关键帧以降低计算开销，但尚不明确是否现有视觉-语言编码器（如SigLIP）能够有效识别最有信息量的帧。

Method: 通过一系列实证研究，分析流行视觉编码器在处理视频文本查询时识别关键帧的能力。

Result: 研究发现流行视觉编码器无法有效定位视频中最相关的部分，从而影响多模态模型的效果。

Conclusion: 需要发展更好的关键帧识别技术，以提升视频多模态大语言模型的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DynaMind框架，解决通过EEG信号重建动态视觉场景中的问题，显著提升视频还原精度与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG信号空间分辨率低、时间不匹配以及难以有效利用语义信息的问题。

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包括区域语义映射器（RSM）、时间动态对齐器（TDA）和双引导视频重建器（DGVR）三个核心模块，共同实现通过神经动力学与语义特征建模的视频重建。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上，重建视频的准确率提高了12.5%与10.3%，并在像素质量上实现9.4%的SSIM提升和19.7%的FVMD下降。

Conclusion: DynaMind显著提升了基于EEG信号的动态图像重建精度与质量，弥合了神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间的差距。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Conclusion: FocusDPO框架在多主体图像生成场景中有效减少属性泄漏，显著提升了主体保真度，推动了可控多主体图像生成的研究进展。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code
is available at https://github.com/Yangbn97/SegAssess.

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集对于改善森林监测和树木生长预测具有重要意义，提供了一个开源工具供研究与实践推广。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更准确和一致的形状映射，表现了在多形状匹配问题上的潜力。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类-场景交互中长时任务复杂性以及对未曾见过场景的泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 使用动态有向图建模，设计了包括环境感知与路径规划的场景导航、将长远目标分解为原子动作的计划代理、多目标评价的闭环反馈机制，以及通过直接偏好优化改进动作生成器以减少肢体失真等问题。

Conclusion: FantasyHSI 利用多智能体和闭环评估框架，突破了现有 HSI 方法在泛化能力和稳定性上的瓶颈，为长时逻辑一致性和动作真实感设立了新标准。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

### [114] [Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01250)

TL;DR: 本论文通过提出Point-PQAE方法，利用跨视图点云重建显著提升了3D自监督学习的效果，显著超过了之前的方法如Point-MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督点云学习因其应用潜力备受关注，而现有方法主要集中在单视图点的重建。然而，两视图学习框架能自然带来更多的多样性与变异性，从而具备更大的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种基于跨视图重建的生成范式Point-PQAE，通过引入点云裁剪与新颖的位置编码来生成和重建点云视图。

Result: 在三个ScanObjectNN的Mlp-Linear评估协议中，该方法比基线(Point-MAE)分别提升了6.5%、7.0%和6.7%。

Conclusion: 通过跨视图的重建方法，显著提高了3D自监督学习的挑战度与学习性能，证实了两视图学习在点云自监督学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型仅关注可见内容，忽视了时间、社会和历史语境，难以应用于新闻报道和数字档案等需事件语义的领域。

Method: ReCap包括三个模块：1. 基于DINOv2特征的两阶段文章检索系统；2. 从文章摘要、通用描述和源元数据中提取上下文信息的框架；3. 结合语义高斯归一化优化流畅性和相关性的生成系统。

Result: 在OpenEvents V1数据集评测，ReCap取得0.54666的高分，在EVENTA 2025比赛中排名第2。

Conclusion: ReCap成功结合了视觉感知与实际知识，提供了应对高风险领域上下文感知图像理解的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

Conclusion: X-Agent框架在开放词汇语义分割中表现出色，为优化潜在语义动态和提高语义感知能力提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Result: 在大规模SARDet-100K数据集上，优化后的模型在检测准确性和计算效率上均优于现有SAR检测方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次将NAS引入SAR目标检测领域，为实际应用中的轻量化模型优化提供了全新的思路。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable

Method: 提出结合ODE和傅里叶变换的全新方法FSS-TIs，通过拟合域特定特征与域无关特征之间的ODE关系，在时间区间上进行迭代变换，同时对频谱进行仿射变换和随机扰动，优化ODE的内在参数以探索域无关特征空间并模拟目标域分布。

Result: FSS-TIs在五个不同域的数据集上的实验结果表明其性能优于现有的跨域少样本分割方法，且通过消融实验验证了其跨域适应能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种结构简洁且性能优越的FSS-TIs方法，能够有效提升跨域少样本分割的性能并具有较强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种端到端框架，通过联合优化同时实现LiDAR的超分辨率和语义分割，提高低成本16通道LiDAR数据的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR数据尽管对自动驾驶中的3D语义分割十分关键，但受限于高成本的传感器，因此需要开发能在低成本LiDAR下仍保持高分割精度的方法。

Method: 设计了一种新型框架，结合LiDAR超分辨率与语义分割，通过联合优化进行训练，并引入SR损失函数。模型轻量化且参数量显著减少，与现有的LiDAR SR方法及分割网络兼容性较高。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出方法可在低分辨率16通道LiDAR上实现与高成本64通道LiDAR数据相当的分割性能。

Conclusion: 创新的轻量化联合框架可有效提升低成本LiDAR数据的分割效果，同时保留了对小物体的细节捕捉。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上的测试表明，PGRD在Dice分数、NLL、ECE等指标上优于Bayesian、Ensemble、Probabilistic U-Net等基线方法，同时减小了采样步骤的需求。

Conclusion: PGRD在保持高效的采样效率及强校准性能的基础上，有效解决医学图像分割中的模糊性问题，并证明其优越性能。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

### [125] [M3Ret: Unleashing Zero-shot Multimodal Medical Image Retrieval via Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01360)
*Che Liu,Zheng Jiang,Chengyu Fang,Heng Guo,Yan-Jie Zhou,Jiaqi Qu,Le Lu,Minfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的统一视觉编码器M3Ret，用于多种医学影像模态的检索，超越了现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前医学影像的检索方法较为零散，不同模态（如2D、3D和视频）需要采用独立的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了模型的扩展性和统一表示方法的发展。

Method: 研究者构建了一个大规模的混合模态数据集（包含867,653个样本），涵盖了2D X线和超声、RGB内镜视频以及3D CT扫描，并使用生成式（MAE）和对比式（SimDINO）自监督学习训练出一个无需模态特定定制的统一视觉编码器M3Ret。

Result: M3Ret在零样本图像检索任务中超越了现有的强基线模型（如DINOv3和BMC-CLIP），实现了跨模态对齐，甚至能够泛化到从未见过的MRI任务中。此外，相关分析表明，这种框架在模型及数据规模上具有良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: M3Ret为基于视觉自监督学习的医学影像多模态理解提供了新的方向，有望成为基础模型的一个重要进展。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Uirapuru框架，专为高分辨率可转向摄像头的视频分析设计，展示了其在准确性和速度上的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，大多数实时视频分析方法仅针对静态视角摄像头，而未考虑动态视角摄像头的挑战。

Method: Uirapuru通过将摄像头的动态运动与每帧快速自适应分块机制结合，从根本上改进了分析方法。

Result: 相比于静态摄像头的方法，Uirapuru在不牺牲延迟和准确性要求的情况下，能提升分析速度最高至4.53倍，或提高准确性至1.45倍。

Conclusion: Uirapuru满足实际应用中高分辨率动态摄像头实时分析的需求，显示出在智能视频服务领域的实际潜力。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Motivation: 现有低光照图像增强方法在无人机超高分辨率图像上表现不佳，存在数据配对缺失、光照不均匀等问题，且难以满足实时部署需求。

Method: 提供了第一个无人机超高分辨率图像的无监督数据集U3D、创新评价指标EEI，以及包含两种训练设计的低光照图像增强框架U3LIE。

Conclusion: 该研究为全天候无人机视觉提供了完整的解决方案，包括数据集、评价指标及增强方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

*Long Zhang,Peipei Song,Jianfeng Dong,Kun Li,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为鲁棒对齐学习（RAL）的框架用于解决部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中的挑战，通过概率建模视频和查询的多元高斯分布以及动态加权机制提高了对齐的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法由于数据不确定性（如查询模糊性和视频片段部分相关性）的影响，容易受到分散视频的干扰，从而导致性能不足，急需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出了鲁棒对齐学习框架（RAL），通过将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模，捕捉跨模态对应关系的变化；并设计了可学习的置信门机制，根据查询词的信息量动态调整相似性权重。

Result: RAL框架能无缝集成到现有检索系统中，实验表明其在多种检索架构下均表现出色。

Conclusion: RAL框架有效减轻了PRVR任务中的数据不确定性问题，提高了跨模态检索的鲁棒性，同时具有较强的通用性。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull方法利用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学成像，通过神经网络处理稀疏和噪声医疗影像数据，且优于传统体素网格方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的医学成像通常采用体素网格表示，但存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失以及无法高效处理稀疏性的问题。作者希望探索更优的几何表示方法。

Method: 提出RibPull方法，基于隐式占用场，用神经网络模型预测3D点是否位于目标内部，并采用拉普拉斯收缩技术提取胸腔的中轴。

Result: 在20个医疗扫描数据上验证了所提方法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 隐式3D表示和连续坐标方法在处理稀疏、噪声较大的医学扫描几何数据上表现出显著优势，其代码将在论文发表后公开。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个称为Neural Scene Designer (NSD)的新框架，可实现用户指定场景区域的照片级操作，同时确保语义对齐和样式一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要专注于生成内容的语义控制，往往忽略了保持样式一致性这一关键任务。

Method: 提出NSD框架，引入高级扩散模型并结合两条并行的交叉注意机制分别处理文本和样式信息；通过PSRL模块实现细粒度样式表征，其中利用样式对比损失保证同一图像区域样式的高相似性和不同图像间区域样式的低相似性。

Result: 通过建立基准，包含竞争算法、样式相关指标、丰富数据集与场景，对框架的有效性进行系统实验验证，表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: NSD为照片级场景编辑提供双重目标解决方案，兼顾语义控制和样式一致性，为此领域研究做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

TL;DR: 作者提出了一个名为MILO的新型全参考图像质量评估指标，它具有多尺度、直观性强，且速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用现有方法往往需要大量人工标注数据，而开发一种无需此类资源也能保证准确性的指标是关键需求。

Method: 通过伪MOS（Mean Opinion Score）监督学习，并利用已有指标中的视觉遮罩效应，设计了紧凑的网络架构。

Result: MILO在图像质量评估基准上表现优异，且支持实时应用。作为感知损失，它大幅提升了降噪、超分辨率、面部修复等任务的表现。

Conclusion: MILO不仅在图像质量评估中达到了前沿水平，同时在生成管线中的感知优化方面表现出实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: 提出解决扩散模型在变尺度图像生成中的问题是一种行之有效的方法，不仅提高了模型在多分辨率下的通用性，还为后续研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Method: 设计了Mamba-CNN，该架构结合了轻量级Mamba灵感的状态空间模型(SSM)门控机制与分层卷积骨干网，动态调节特征图以突出关键面部特征及长距离空间关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准上，Mamba-CNN的Pearson相关系数达到了0.9187，平均绝对误差（MAE）为0.2022，均方根误差（RMSE）为0.2610，创下新性能纪录。

Conclusion: 提出了一个结合CNN和选择性SSM的协同网络设计，不仅高效且具有长距离建模能力，适用于细致的视觉理解任务。

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what

Conclusion: 提出的重建方法有效且性能优越，通过结合合成与真实数据训练发型先验，解决了传统单张照片3D头发建模方法的关键挑战。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为PointSlice的新方法，通过将点云切片为二维数据来处理3D点云，大幅提高了推理速度并减少了模型参数，同时确保精准的3D目标检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的点云处理方法在精度和速度之间存在权衡，因此需要一种方法能够在提高推理速度的同时保持或接近当前的检测精度。

Method: PointSlice通过横向切割点云生成多个2D数据切片，并设计了专门的Slice Interaction Network (SIN) 以保持切片间的垂直关系，从而在2D数据中实现3D目标感知。

Result: PointSlice在Waymo数据集上比当前最优方法快1.13倍，参数减少0.79倍，仅降低1.2 mAPH精度；在nuScenes数据集上达到66.74 mAP（最新最优结果）；在Argoverse 2数据集上快1.10倍，参数减少0.66倍，精度仅降低1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice在极大提升推理速度和减小模型复杂度的情况下，维持了优越的检测性能，是点云处理领域的重要创新成果。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

TL;DR: ConTiCoM-3D 是一种能高效生成高质量 3D 形状的连续时间一致性模型，具有快速推理与优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决当前 3D 形状生成方法依赖迭代去噪或潜在解码器的低效问题，本文提出一种通过点空间直接生成 3D 形状的新方法。

Method: 通过结合 TrigFlow 方法的连续噪声计划和基于 Chamfer 距离的几何损失，使用时间条件神经网络设计出一种稳定的连续时间一致性模型。

Result: 在 ShapeNet 基准测试中表现优异，在质量和效率上匹配或超过最先进的扩散和潜在一致性模型。

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D 是一个用于可扩展 3D 形状生成的高效且优质的框架，适用于机器人、增强现实/虚拟现实及数字内容创作等领域。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种具有自适应卷积模块的新型MSA2-Net，用于医疗图像分割并表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对nnUNet无法自动调整网络内部超参数的问题，提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 引入自适应卷积模块并将其应用于MSA2-Net的关键部分（多尺度卷积桥和融合解码器），动态调整卷积核，优化特征提取。

Result: MSA2-Net在Synapse、ACDC、Kvasir和ISIC2017数据集上的Dice系数分别达到86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%。

Conclusion: 利用自适应卷积模块增强了医学图像分割的精度和鲁棒性，有效捕获不同尺寸器官的细节。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对高分辨率图像和长视频理解的需求增加，图像-语言模型面临计算效率降低的问题，需要一种方法减少处理令牌的数量改进效率。

Method: 通过分析视觉令牌的变化特性，提出一种任务无关的视觉令牌变异感知方法V$^2$Drop，从推理过程中逐步移除变化最小的视觉令牌，提升效率。

Result: V$^2$Drop方法在多个模型和基准测试中表现优越，图像理解性能保持94.0%，视频理解保持98.6%，而推理延迟分别减少31.5%和74.2%。

Conclusion: V$^2$Drop通过减少无关视觉令牌，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，并进一步降低了GPU峰值内存使用量。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Motivation: 现有的通用视觉语言模型在放射诊断等高要求领域缺乏足够的判别精度，而公共3D CT数据集的稀缺性和异质性也限制了其发展。

Method: 提出Uniferum模型，将分类标签和分割掩码等多种监督信号统一到单一训练框架中，结合三个带有不同标注的公共3D CT数据集，进行模型训练与优化。

Result: 在CT-RATE基准上超过CLIP和传统多标签模型7%的AUROC性能，并展示了在RAD-CHEST和INSPECT数据集中的零样本性能和异常的分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过整合异质性标注和体部分割，有望实现数据高效、临床可靠的3D医学影像分析新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: 为了解决HIFU治疗中由于超声干扰导致实时监测受限的问题。

Method: 开发了HIFU-ILDiff模型，结合向量量化变分自编码器(VQ-VAE)和潜在扩散模型，对超声图像进行干扰去除与重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，HIFU-ILDiff在图像结构相似度(SSIM)和信噪比(PSNR)上显著优于常用的凹槽滤波器，同时实现更快速的实时处理能力。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够高效地去除HIFU引起的超声干扰，适用于实时监测，具有潜力改进临床HIFU治疗的精准性。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有SLAM系统对相机内参的依赖限制了其在不同相机设置下的适用性，因此需要一种无需相机内参的解决方案，同时解决前端模型复杂性和后端漂移问题。

Method: 通过轻量级STA（对称双视图关联）模型作为前端，估算相对相机位姿并回归局部点云图；后端构建包含环路闭合的Sim(3)位姿图以减小漂移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相机跟踪和稠密三维重建质量上优于现有方法，且前端模型复杂性降低至类似方法的35%。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一种适用于多种相机设置的高性能SLAM解决方案，具有实时性、精度高和模型轻量化的特点。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit能够高效、高保真地进行视频编辑，并简化了模型设计和训练资源需求。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse

resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Conclusion: 该方法无须繁重的人工标注，证明了同行评估方式是自监督对齐的可扩展替代方案，显著提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

TL;DR: 本文提出Q-Sched，这是一种修改扩散模型调度器的新方法，用于后训练量化，从而大幅降低计算成本，同时保持全精度准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Text-to-image扩散模型计算成本高，包括稳定扩散XL在内的模型处理单批次图像需要较多的计算资源。少步骤扩散模型降低了去噪步骤的要求，但其依赖于高成本的大型模型，阻碍了后训练量化方法的应用。

Method: 提出Q-Sched，通过调整少步采样轨迹，而非更改模型权重，从而实现量化。并引入JAQ损失函数，用于学习量化敏感的预处理参数，无需全精度推断，仅需少量校准样本。

Result: Q-Sched相比传统量化模型显著提升了性能，如在FID指标上，比FP16的4步和8步模型分别提升了15.5%和16.6%。

Conclusion: Q-Sched展示出量化和少步骤蒸馏相结合的潜力，能够在不牺牲生成质量的前提下极大地减少计算需求。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

*Yanqing Liu,Xianhang Li,Letian Zhang,Zirui Wang,Zeyu Zheng,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化OpenVision架构和损失设计的方法，大幅提升了训练效率，同时保持性能竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决OpenVision初代模型在训练效率和资源消耗方面的不足，并简化架构及训练过程。

Method: 通过移除文本编码器和对比损失，只保留生成式的标题损失作为训练信号，提出了OpenVision 2。

Result: OpenVision 2在多模态基准测试中表现与原始模型相当，但训练时间减少约1.5倍，显存占用降低约1.8倍，可支持更大的模型规模。

Conclusion: 轻量化且仅使用生成式训练的设计，为多模态基础模型中的视觉编码器开发提供了高效而有前景的方向。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有限角度CT重建中的伪影问题，提升影像质量，同时降低辐射剂量。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段基于元数据生成粗略解剖信息，第二阶段结合粗略信息和元数据精细化影像，且在每一步采样中通过物理一致性算法校正。

Result: 在合成和真实的心脏CT数据集上表现优异，改进了SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标，特别是在严重角度截断的情况下。

Conclusion: 元数据的集成显著提升了重建质量与效率，特别是诊断和人口统计元数据，对未来基于元数据的医学影像框架具有重要意义。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect

loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus

Conclusion: BIB和MBIB证明了其在信息论视角下同时进行表示学习和分类的有效性，为长尾视觉识别领域带来新的方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Motivation: 当前光照控制方法依赖于特定领域的大数据集，限制泛化能力和适用性。

Method: 提出将图像光照关系映射到自注意力层的token交互中，并训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐射图以指导图像生成。

Result: 方法表现出广泛的条件和图像域适应能力，且在图像质量和控制方面均达到最新状态。

Conclusion: PractiLight通过基础知识实现了实用的通用再光照控制，具有高效参数利用和数据需求。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Motivation: 现有基于组织病理学图像预测基因表达的模型受数据丢失影响较大，且大多依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，存在对数据对齐质量依赖和批次效应等问题。解决这些限制成为研究动机。

Method: 引入了一种无需参考的潜在基因扩散模型LGDiST，使用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富的基因潜在空间，并在模型中加入ST潜在空间和邻居条件机制。

Result: LGDiST在26个数据集上的基因表达填补平均MSE降低了18%，并通过改善数据完成进一步提升六种先进方法预测性能最高达10%。

Conclusion: 实验表明LGDiST模型的完整架构显著优于其任何单独组件，验证了其对空间转录组数据填补与预测的核心作用。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

TL;DR: RocketScience是一种针对空间关系理解的新型对比视觉语言模型（VLM）基准测试，由真实世界的图文数据对组成，用以测试模型对相对空间理解及物体排列顺序的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的开放及商业化的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在空间关系理解方面表现较差，亟需一个专门的基准测试来评估这一关键能力。

Method: 设计了RocketScience基准测试，使用简单的人类理解测试和难度较高的VLM评估场景，通过拆解分析来分离物体定位和空间推理的贡献因素。

Result: 结果显示，当前的开源及前沿商业VLM在该基准测试中的表现显著不足，但推理模型有令人惊讶的高表现；性能瓶颈主要在于空间推理能力，而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: RocketScience揭示了VLMs在空间关系推理方面的不足并提供了对比基准，其数据集已通过CC-BY-4.0许可证开放，评估代码亦公开。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be
available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.

Method: 提出的框架加入了概念感知对齐模块，将图像和位置嵌入投影到共享的地理概念库中，并通过最小化概念级别的损失，在概念相关的子空间中增强对齐性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这是首次在地理定位中引入可解释性的方法，展示了其在提升性能和揭示地理决策过程中的潜力。

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Motivation: 现有的多模态模型难以在结构特殊的图解图像等专业领域中表现出色。

Method: 提出基于对比学习的训练框架，加入两个特殊的损失函数以利用图解的结构属性，增强模型对图解内容的语义理解。

Result: 在流图基准数据集中，方法在图文匹配和视觉问答任务上明显优于标准CLIP和硬负样本CLIP学习范式。

Conclusion: 专门设计的训练策略对专业领域任务至关重要，可推动图解理解在视觉-语言整合中的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Motivation: 在图像修复任务中，既需要局部像素级的细节生成，又需要全局语义的一致性，但现有方法在效率和生成质量之间难以平衡。

Method: 提出基于二维高斯散点的框架，将缺失图像编码为二维高斯点系数的连续场，并通过可微分的光栅化过程重建图像，同时引入局部块光栅化策略提高效率，并结合DINO的全局特征引导大范围修复时的语义对齐。

Conclusion: 利用GS的连续渲染方式和全局特征整合能力，该方法在图像修复中实现了高效且一致的修复效果。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂的多主体生成打开了新方向，提供了高质量的解决方案，克服了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Method: 提出了一种称为Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN)的方法，通过Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI)机制生成逆Gumbel噪声，使得精确图像重构成为可能，并实现与文本提示对齐的 targeted 图像编辑。

Result: 实验表明，VARIN能根据指定的文本提示有效修改源图像，同时极大程度保留了原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN作为一种实际的图像编辑方法，其性能和效果验证了VAR模型在文本指导图像编辑任务中的潜在优势。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Motivation: 现有的文本生成图像（T2I）模型在图像编辑精度上表现欠佳，问题在于理解和生成模块之间的职责分配不平衡，而理解模块通常掌握更多的复杂推理能力。

Method: 提出DIM数据集，包含DIM-T2I子集（增强复杂指令理解能力）和DIM-Edit子集（作为图像编辑的显式设计蓝图），用轻量级MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，并在DIM数据集上训练，形成DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit模型。

Conclusion: 将设计职责显式分配给理解模块可以显著提高图像编辑性能，证明了这一新方法的有效性，并将提供公开的数据集和模型。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various

nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous

backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了轻量化、优化的模型（如MobileNet）是资源受限环境中可扩展、低成本且临床适用的NICU监测系统的最佳选择，为改善早产儿护理提供了一条新的路径。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>

Motivation: 分析RMOT系统中视觉-文本统一表示的安全性，并识别潜在的设计逻辑漏洞。

Method: 设计了对抗框架VEIL，对高级RMOT模型的FIFO记忆机制及其空间-时间推理模块进行有针对性的攻击评估。

Result: 实验表明，VEIL可以显著破坏RMOT模型的跟踪可靠性，导致跟踪ID切换及终止。

Conclusion: 现有RMOT模型存在安全漏洞，需要更安全的设计以应对各种潜在攻击。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch机制，用于改进现有的slot attention模式，克服其高语义信息缺乏和编码器无法微调的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前slot attention方法对低级别特征过于敏感，限制了对物体语义特征的理解，同时其编码器稳定性需求限制了模型的灵活性。

Method: 引入ContextFusion阶段以使用前景与背景的语义信息，辅以上下文线索丰富语义内容；通过Bootstrap Branch将特征适配与重建阶段分离，利用引导策略提高适配灵活性。

Result: 实验显示方法在模拟和真实数据集上显著提升了现有先进slot attention模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 改进的slot attention模型能够更好地进行无监督的目标分割和理解任务，且方法具有较强的适用性和灵活性。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Motivation: 目前的方法难以检测逻辑异常，且大多抛弃了空间和语义信息，导致性能不足。本研究旨在解决这一问题，提升逻辑异常检测能力。

Method: 提出了SALAD方法，包括新颖的组成分支来显式建模对象组成图的分布，并引入了一种无需人工标签或特定分类信息的组成图提取新过程。

Result: SALAD在逻辑异常检测的标准基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于现有方法，达到了96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: SALAD通过有效的组成图分布建模，并结合语义信息，显著优化了逻辑异常检测任务，展示了其在实际应用中的潜在价值。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Method: 通过统一的图神经网络框架处理非重叠子片段并采用新颖的自回归长期跟踪层进行融合，调整子片段大小以兼顾时延和时间上下文的平衡。

Result: 在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和MOT20等数据集上表现卓越，在线模式的AssA指标分别提升了2.3、9.2和5.0，而离线模式的提升更显著。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT不仅在在线模式下性能优异，还提供了一种能够适应多种时间跨度的灵活跟踪方法，对多目标跟踪领域有重要贡献。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the

Result: 新提出的初始化策略显著提高了多种方法在ITD基准上的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集为时间自适应研究提供了更具真实场景挑战的测试平台，提出的方法有效应对了时序依赖带来的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

*Yingrui Ji,Jiansheng Chen,Jingbo Chen,Anzhi Yue,Chenhao Wang,Kai Li,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为RS-OOD的框架，用于解决遥感中的分布外检测问题，增强少样本检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据面临数据稀缺、多尺度复杂结构及显著的分布偏移问题，现有OOD检测方法和基准不适用于遥感领域。

Method: 提出三大创新：空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制和基于置信度的自训练循环，利用视觉-语言建模实现强大的遥感少样本OOD检测。

Result: RS-OOD在多个遥感基准数据集上优于现有方法，能够在最少标签数据的条件下进行高效适配。

Conclusion: 空间和语义的一体化对于提升遥感分布外检测的能力至关重要。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Conclusion: SynthGenNet有效提升了跨域场景理解能力，通过无监督学习方法解决了现实世界的多样性问题并且减少了对标记数据的依赖，是复杂城市场景理解中的一次有意义的进展。

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了解决文本生成图像模型在空间推理任务中表现不足的问题，引入了一个名为Learn-to-Steer的新框架，其显著提高了空间关系生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本生成图像扩散模型在处理复杂空间关系组合时表现不佳，比如将一只狗放在玩具熊右侧或将长颈鹿置于飞机上。

Method: 作者提出了一种新框架Learn-to-Steer，通过轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，并在推理阶段将其作为学习损失函数；使用双重反转策略避免分类器使用语言痕迹取巧。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在FLUX.1-dev上的空间准确性从0.20显著提升到0.61，在SD2.1上的准确性从0.07提升到0.54。

Conclusion: Learn-to-Steer框架不仅大幅提升了空间推理准确性，还具备多种空间关系的泛化能力，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Motivation: 当前人工模型评估通常忽略游戏这一挑战人类特性的任务，本研究希望通过棋盘游戏更全面地评估人工模型的类人性。

Method: 通过棋盘游戏Hues & Cues测试CLIP模型的颜色感知和命名能力，并分析其与人类的对齐程度。

Result: 实验发现，CLIP总体对齐良好，但暴露出文化偏见和抽象层级处理不一致的问题，这些通过常规测试策略难以发现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用棋盘游戏等多样化任务评估模型，可以揭示出常规基准测试难以发现的缺陷。

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多模态大语言模型在GUI（图形用户界面）和实体环境（3D真实世界）中的任务执行能力，并提出了OmniActor ，一个应用于多任务环境的高性能通用智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体大多集中于单一的GUI或实体任务环境，缺乏在两种环境中协同工作的能力，然而许多复杂任务需要在二维虚拟和三维真实环境中交替进行交互。

Method: 提出了一种名为Layer-heterogeneity MoE的新结构，用以解决GUI和实体数据层次冲突，通过浅层参数共享和深层参数分离来实现协同。此外，统一了两种环境的动作空间，并收集了多来源的大规模数据进行训练。

Result: OmniActor在GUI和实体任务表现上均有优越性，尤其是在GUI任务上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: OmniActor通过成功消除冲突并利用协同效应，实现了在多种环境任务中的高性能。代码未来将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动方法ORDAdaptive Correction (ORDAC)，通过标签分布学习对具有噪声的序数标签进行动态校正，在多个基准数据集上展现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督深度学习通常需要标记数据，而序数分类任务中模糊的类别边界易导致标签噪声，从而影响模型性能及可靠性。

Method: 基于标签分布学习，提出ORDAC方法，通过动态调整标签分布均值和标准差，对噪声标签进行修正以优化训练数据使用。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，ORDAC及其扩展版本显著改善了模型性能，如Adience数据集40%噪声场景下，将MAE从0.86降低至0.62，Recall从0.37提高至0.49。

Conclusion: 自适应标签校正，特别是利用标签分布，能有效提升序数分类模型在噪声数据下的鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Conclusion: C33D方法实现了创新的3D对象合成，确保了结构一致性和纹理准确性，展示了广阔应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Method: 提出一个名为MulSeT的基准测试，设计了系列实验研究多模态模型在单视角、多视角和视频场景的空间推理表现；分析了数据扩展和建筑设计方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 空间理解性能随着训练数据增加而迅速收敛，但性能上限较低且仅靠扩展数据不足；空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码，模型结构优化在提升空间推理能力方面有潜力。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在空间推理上的表现有限，通过数据扩展和架构调优或能显著提升模型的空间理解能力，未来研究应向这些方向深化。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Result: MedDINOv3在四个医学分割基准上达到或超越了当前最优秀方法的表现。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可以作为统一的骨干网络，用于医学影像分割领域。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and

achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

Motivation: 现有的卷积神经网络的医疗图像分割效果依赖于高质量标注，但这些标注的获取非常昂贵且费时，并且不可避免地含有噪声，这会影响模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种几何-结构双引导网络（GSD-Net），通过几何和结构特征增强对噪声标注的鲁棒性，包括几何距离感知模块、结构引导标签细化模块和知识转移模块，分别用于调整像素权重、细化标签和提升局部特征的敏感性。

Conclusion: GSD-Net在应对噪声标注的医疗图像分割任务中达到了当前最优性能，其代码已公开以供使用。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅在高质量图像融合中表现优越，且为轻量级模型的发展提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为RiverScope的高分辨率河流与地表水数据集，以及相应的模型评估方法，大幅提高了河宽估算的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地表水监测方法在空间和时间尺度上面临挑战，尤其是窄小或富含沉积物的河流难以通过低分辨率卫星数据捕获，亟需开发新的数据集和方法。

Method: 开发了高分辨率数据集RiverScope，包含1,145张带有专家标记的河流和地表水掩模图像，同时与Sentinel-2、SWOT等卫星数据对齐；此外评估了基于深度学习的多种网络架构、迁移学习和多光谱通道结合的有效性。

Result: 建立了首个全球高分辨率河宽估算基准，模型中值误差仅为7.2米，显著优于现有卫星方法；并展示了迁移学习和多光谱通道在模型性能上的提升。

Conclusion: RiverScope为细尺度、多传感器水文建模和气候适应及可持续水资源管理提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前视频合成需要大量人工和专家协作，生产周期长且成本高。研究目的是通过自动化生成模型优化这一过程。

Method: 设计了一个基于Diffusion Transformer (DiT) 的流水线，结合背景保持分支、Dynamic元素继承模块以及用户可控布局的扩展位置嵌入 (ERoPE)。此外，构建了包含61K视频集的VideoComp数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在一致性和保真度方面优于现有可能的解决方案，能够有效实现生成式视频合成。

Conclusion: 通过所提出的方法，成功实现了自动化且高质量的视频合成，可有效减少传统流程的问题和成本。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Motivation: 改善文本到虚拟化身的生成效率与效果，超越以往基于SDS模型和一般大型3D生成模型的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略，先从人像重建模型蒸馏出结构化潜在空间，再训练可控文本的潜在扩散模型生成3D虚拟化身。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于之前的生成模型。

Conclusion: TeRA通过消除迭代优化瓶颈并实现文本自定义，提高了文本到虚拟化身生成的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在医学图像中应用的改进型位置编码(AFPE)，并证明其在各类实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法在处理医学图像中复杂形状和高维数据的各向异性特征往往表现欠佳，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种新的各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，可以结合各向异性、类别和领域特定的空间依赖性。并在多个医学图像数据集上进行了系统的基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，选择合适的位置编码能显著提高模型性能，AFPE在所有测试中的各向异性设定下都表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在处理各向异性的医学图像及其视频时，选择适合的各向异性位置编码对数据和目标形状非常重要，而AFPE是一个优秀的选择。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Motivation: 现有方法使用计算量大的3D模型，限制了在实时或资源受限条件下的可行性，因此需要轻量化的解决方案来实现有效的健身运动识别。

Method: 使用预训练的2D卷积神经网络（如ResNet50、EfficientNet、ViT）提取空间特征，同时通过LSTM捕获时间依赖关系，并使用空间注意机制来强调关键片段。

Result: 在UCF101数据集的子集上进行评估，并取得了最高93.34%的准确率。相比其他先进的HAR（人类活动识别）系统具有更高的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是一个可扩展且具备实时处理能力的解决方案，适用于基于视觉的健康与活动监测，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Conclusion: 开发的MDM-MixMFL框架能够在解决模态与数据异构问题的同时，提高混合模态联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

*Xinrui Gong,Oliver Hahn,Christoph Reich,Krishnakant Singh,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Daniel Cremers,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MR-DINOSAUR的方法，能够在无需任何人类监督下，从视觉场景中发现和定位多个对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于伪标签来训练对象中心化学习模型，但这些伪标签的生成涉及有监督的步骤，限制了无监督多对象发现的实际应用。

Method: 提出的MR-DINOSAUR方法以DINOSAUR模型为基础，结合无监督光流的运动分割生成高质量的无监督伪标签，通过改进的槽表示和槽去激活模块，区分前景和背景对象。

Result: MR-DINOSAUR在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上实现了强大的多对象发现性能，超越了以往的无监督方法。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR方法实现了完全无监督的多对象发现，用简单的建模达到了优异的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Motivation: 解决3D视觉模型由于推理效率低所导致的扩展至长序列输入的难题。

Method: 分析VGGT的瓶颈和注意力图的token崩溃现象，设计了一种适用于3D架构和任务的token合并策略，通过无训练机制优化计算效率。

Result: 在多个3D几何基准测试中，FastVGGT实现了长序列情景下的推理加速（达4倍）并缓解了错误积累问题。

Conclusion: token合并技术是打造可扩展3D视觉系统的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新框架MultiStream-LLM，通过多专家模块设计和流整合提升手语翻译性能，在多个基准上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的端到端模型在手语翻译中难以解决高速度手指拼写和异步非手动面部信号问题，特别是在处理关键信息时表现不佳。

Method: 论文引入了一种模块化框架MultiStream-LLM，分别针对连续手语、手指拼写和唇读设计专用网络，将其解码为token序列，使用轻量化的Transformer融合流并消除时间上不对齐情况，最终将结果输入大型语言模型生成句子。

Result: 在How2Sign基准上该方法以BLEU-4得分23.5刷新了记录，同时在ChicagoFSWildPlus手指拼写数据集上取得了73.2%的字母准确率。

Conclusion: 通过分离并解决不同的识别任务后再进行融合，该多专家方法显著提升了手语翻译的准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Conclusion: 这一工作首次将声明式优化方法应用于SLR管道，为SLR自动化领域提供了验证性和可重复性的创新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

Conclusion: 通过新的框架，使推理过程更结构化且可解释，为多步推理任务创造更多可能性并提高分析的透明度。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM基准主要关注检索或总结相关信息，而不评估模型在跨文档分析中识别具有区分性的稀有特征的能力。提出此任务是为了反映实际中候选人选择或产品差异化等问题中的统计推理需求。

Method: 提出Distinctive Feature Mining任务，同时引入DiFBench框架，用于创建具备可控参数（如文档集大小和稀有性阈值）的基准测试集，并评估十种LLM的表现。

Result: 分析发现，增强推理的模型在该任务上表现优于通用模型，但所有模型在任务复杂性和文档数量增加时性能均显著下降。常见失败模式是将高频特征误识别为稀有特征。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前高级LLMs在细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测上的核心局限性，为模型改进和未来任务设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RITE的新方法，将逻辑推理融入文本嵌入过程，显著提升零样本检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器检索器对复杂语义查询的处理有限，解码器的强推理能力为检索提供潜力。

Method: 基于LLMs生成推理中间文本，然后计算嵌入，增强表示复合能力。

Result: 在BRIGHT基准测试中，RITE显著提升了跨领域零样本检索性能。

Conclusion: 将推理能力融入到嵌入过程中是提升检索效果的有效途径。

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了OpinioRAG，一个框架通过结合RAG的证据检索和大型语言模型（LLMs），实现针对大体量用户点评的高效、个性化摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法在大规模用户点评上高效运行或生成具有个性化需求的摘要，针对此问题，我们开发了一个能够满足不同需求的可扩展框架。

Method: 提出OpinioRAG框架，结合RAG证据检索与大型语言模型，并设计新的无参考核验指标来提高情感密集领域的摘要生成质量。

Result: 实验显示，OpinioRAG框架能有效生成准确、相关且结构化的摘要，同时提供了大规模数据集和分析意见摘要生成任务的若干挑战。

Conclusion: OpinioRAG提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，能实现高效生成个性化用户点评摘要，推动了该领域未来研究方向的发展。

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用生成式人工智能构建了日本工资情感指数(WSI)，显示能更精准地预测工资动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过生成式人工智能工具分析经济文本，以改进经济预测，特别是在工资动态的预测领域。

Method: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型(LLMs)的WSI，利用内阁办公室每月开展的经济观察者调查(EWS)数据进行分析，并开发可扩展的数据架构以整合其他数据源。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LLMs的WSI模型在性能上显著优于基线方法和预训练模型。

Conclusion: 研究证明LLM驱动的情感指数有助于提高经济政策设计的及时性和效果，具有较高的实用潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [224] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在蒸馏模型上应用RLHF的挑战，并提出了平衡演员初始化方法（BAI）以解决关键问题，例如序列长度崩溃和奖励曲线异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合蒸馏训练与RLHF方法提升大语言模型的对齐与推理能力，但面临训练稳定性及性能下降的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段加权模型合并的方法（BAI）：首先合并指令微调模型与蒸馏推理模型，然后进一步与预训练模型融合以保留基础知识。

Result: 实验证明，BAI方法有效解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲线不稳定现象，并提高了训练稳定性与推理能力。

Conclusion: BAI方法在第三范式下显著改进了大语言模型的训练稳定性与推理性能，为结合蒸馏效率与RLHF对齐提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [225] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER是一种通过自我反思和修订提高LLM输出质量的框架，无需示例或模板，基于自然语言描述的推理空白进行改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，如何提高大型语言模型(LLM)的推理质量成为研究重点。大多数方法依赖预设示例和模板，而本研究提出一种无需此类依赖的通用框架。

Method: 提出GIER框架，通过自然语言描述推理空白，使用模型自我评估和多次修订来提高其输出质量。

Result: 在SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI等任务以及四种LLM中，GIER显著提高了推理质量（理由合理性、基础依据及推理对齐性），且不影响任务准确性。

Conclusion: GIER表明，LLMs不仅可以理解抽象推理空白，还能将其转化为具体改进，展示出较强的自我优化潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

### [226] [Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00375)
*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了InfoSeek，一个框架，用于生成复杂的深度研究任务数据集，并证明其在提升LLMs性能方面的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有基准测试不能充分捕捉深度研究任务复杂性的问题，并生成无需捷径推理且结构深度足够的数据集。

Method: 提出InfoSeek框架，通过双代理系统从网页中递归生成研究树，并将其转换为层级化自然语言问题，生成50K+训练样本和推理轨迹。

Result: 训练于InfoSeek的数据显著提升了3B LLM的性能，使其在BrowseComp-Plus基准上超越了许多更大的模型和商业API，并与更强大的API表现相当。

Conclusion: InfoSeek 为构造复杂推理任务数据集树立了新标杆，有助于进一步优化LLMs的推理能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [227] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GraphKV的图形框架，可用于优化KV缓存管理，通过动态更新节点重要性实现更高效的长序列文本处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存淘汰策略依赖静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中令牌之间的动态相关性。

Method: 通过将令牌建模为图的节点，利用重要性得分与相似度关系建立边，并通过衰减信号传播机制动态更新节点的重要性，实现自适应淘汰。

Result: GraphKV能够无缝嵌入现有方法如SnapKV和PyramidKV，提高KV缓存管理效率。提供的代码将发布在Github上。

Conclusion: GraphKV通过图和动态信号传播机制改进了KV缓存中的令牌选择策略，对长文本处理任务性能提升显著。

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### [228] [The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391)
*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了基于梯度的对抗提示方法（如GCG和T-GCG），揭示了模型规模、评估方法和任务类型对攻击成功率的影响，同时探讨了退火策略的方法潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基于梯度的对抗提示方法（如GCG）的局限性、适用性及其在不同提示任务上的表现，以提升对抗性评估的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用GCG和退火增强的T-GCG，对多个开源LLM（Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, GPT-OSS-20B）的安全提示和编码提示中的攻击效果进行评估，并结合语义判断和前缀启发式评估进行对比。

Result: 发现：(1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增加而下降；(2) 前缀启发式评估高估了攻击效果，而GPT-4o语义判断提供更严格评估；(3) 编码提示比对抗性安全提示更脆弱。退火方法在模拟多样性搜索中表现出潜力，但对语义评估的优势有限。

Conclusion: 研究指出GCG方法的扩展性局限性，揭示了推理任务中的潜在漏洞，并建议发展退火启发策略以改进对抗性评估方法。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

*Juraj Vladika,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MedSEBA的交互式AI系统，用于合成基于证据的医学问题答案，依赖大语言模型和PubMed数据库支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因在线医学信息量大且可信度难以判断，以及新医学研究多且信息不易掌握的问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成答案，并动态从PubMed数据库中检索可信医学研究支撑答案，提供论点及研究支持/反对的概览及时间轴演化可视化。

Result: 用户研究表明，医学专家与普通用户均认为系统可信、有用且信息丰富。

Conclusion: MedSEBA系统适用于日常健康问题与深入研究，能有效提供基于证据的医学问答。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章创建了一个新构造语言Camlang，用于测试大型语言模型在语法规则和词汇映射等元语言推理上的能力，发现GPT-5的表现远不及人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型(LMMs)在学习一门非熟悉语言时是否能通过显式元语言推理掌握其语法结构，而不仅仅是依赖模式匹配能力。

Method: 设计了Camlang这一带有自然和未分布特征组合的新构造语言，并通过包含语法书和双语词典，为模型提供学习资源，进行相关测试和评估。此外，还将CommonsenseQA转换为Camlang，并创建了任务Camlang-CSQA-v0，用以评估模型在语法规则和词汇映射应用上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-5在英语中表现高达98%，但在Camlang中仅47%，远远低于人类87%的表现。同时，其他最先进的LLM在Camlang中的表现更差。

Conclusion: Camlang提供了一个以认知为基础的评估框架，揭示了当前语言模型在元语言能力方面与人类的显著差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU改进了经典的检索增强生成（RAG）框架，通过引入基于全局上下文的语义单元（SU）来提升检索与生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统RAG方法中局部语义单元提取引发的歧义、复杂耦合及高检索开销问题，提出了一种更能体现全局语义关系的解决方案。

Method: GOSU通过对局部语义单元进行全局合并并指导实体和关系抽取，从而简化共指消解并揭示全局语义对象。同时，在检索和生成阶段引入分层关键词抽取和语义单元补全，分别解决细粒度二元关系和粗粒度多元关系的获取问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，GOSU在多项任务上的生成质量优于现有的RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元的设计有效提升了RAG的性能，为复杂语义关系的检索与生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对伊斯兰继承法涉及的复杂份额计算挑战，通过高效、隐私保护的AI方法简化问题解决过程。

Method: 采用MARBERT等阿拉伯语专用编码器和注意力相关评分机制处理问题，评估其在QIAS 2025数据集上的表现，并与大型语言模型（LLM）进行对比。

Result: MARBERT方法在不依赖大型模型的情况下实现69.87%的准确率，相较于最优LLM的87.6%表现，展现了小型专业化系统的实际优势。

Conclusion: 研究展示了大型模型性能与小型系统实际部署效率之间的重要权衡，为高风险领域的AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

*Beining Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TECP的新框架，通过分析令牌层面的熵来量化语言生成的不确定性，同时结合分裂一致性校准技术，确保生成结果的可靠覆盖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的不确定性量化方法几乎都依赖于模型内部信号或启发式的语义一致特征，缺乏适用于黑箱模型的通用方法。

Method: TECP利用令牌熵作为无参不确定性度量，并通过分裂一致性预测中的量化校准生成形式化覆盖保证。

Result: 通过在六大语言模型和两个基准测试上的实验，TECP展现了比基于自一致性的UQ方法更好的覆盖性和预测集合紧凑性。

Conclusion: TECP为黑箱大语言模型的可信生成提供了一种有效且依据明确的方法，是不确定性量化挑战的重要进展。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

*Li S. Yifei,Allen Chang,Chaitanya Malaviya,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍ResearchQA，一个评估LLM系统的资源，将75个研究领域的综述文章提炼为21K查询和160K评价指标，通过31位博士评估者的测试，并分析18个系统的能力差距，发现当前系统在覆盖评价指标上表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对研究问题的长文回答评估依赖专家标注，这种方法仅限于某些领域，但研究的专业知识分布广泛。研究综述文章能够综合分散于文献中的知识，本文旨在利用这种方法构建资源以评估LLM系统的能力。

Method: 作者通过综述文章提取21K查询和160K评价指标，并基于这些指标验证其支持博士研究需求。利用这些指标，作者构建了自动配对评估，并在多领域测试中分析现有系统的能力差距，同时发布相关数据。

Result: 研究表明，当前未有系统在覆盖评价指标上超过70%，表现最好的一种系统覆盖率达到75%，但在引用、局限性和比较指标上的应对能力仍然较低。

Conclusion: 本文释放了一种新的资源ResearchQA，为LLM系统的多领域综合评估奠定了基础，揭示了当前系统在知识覆盖方面的不足，呼吁未来研究关注这些能力缺陷并改进方法。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

Conclusion: 所提方法在保证性能的同时，提高了表示的压缩效率和灵活性，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在法律语境下生成符合特定角色视角信息摘要时潜在的偏倚问题，尤其是模型如何被法律体系中的利益相关者定位或使用。

Method: 提出了一个基于法律事实和推理纳入的评估框架，分析模型在不同法律角色提示下对司法判决的摘要表现，同时考察其对利益相关者的偏好倾向。

Result: 结果表明，即使模型接受了平衡信息的提示，其内容选择仍表现出角色一致的倾向性。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了在高风险法律环境中，需要研究与评估LLMs的角色感知摘要行为的重要性，以应对可能的对齐和偏倚问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现加强推理能力的过程中，LLMs可能更易受到恶意请求的影响，尤其在密集模型中表现明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在提升推理能力过程中是否可能引发安全或价值偏差的问题。

Method: 通过切换至“思考模式”或在良性数学数据集上微调等方式增强推理能力，并分析模型的内部状态。

Result: 发现加强推理后模型对恶意请求响应更容易，注意力转移和专家机制有助于部分缓解安全性问题。

Conclusion: 加强推理能力可能带来安全与推理能力的权衡，强调需要更先进的对齐方法以应对这一挑战。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型在测试与实际部署环境中的行为差异显著，并提出一种重新设计提示的方法来量化和分析这种差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI模型测试结果可能与实际表现不一致的问题，尤其是在模型的安全性和诚实性评估方面。

Method: 利用线性探测器对提示进行评分，定义“测试化”和“部署化”之间的连续尺度，并通过要求模型重写提示来向更自然的“部署化”上下文转变，从而保持任务一致的情况下观察行为差异。

Result: 重写提示后“部署化”提示的平均探测得分提高了30%，所有测试模型中诚实回复平均增加5.26%，欺骗性回复平均减少12.40%，拒绝率平均增加6.38%，表明更高的安全合规性。

Conclusion: 模型在感知到测试环境时更倾向于产生不安全或欺骗性输出，提出了更现实的评估框架，以在部署前准确衡量模型的对齐程度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服Transformer在处理长序列时因其二次复杂度(O(N^2))而产生的计算瓶颈。

Method: 设计了GAM网络，用因果卷积提取局部上下文，用并行联想记忆机制捕获全局特征，并用门控机制动态融合这两种信息。

Result: 实验证明GAM在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上训练速度更快，验证困惑度优于或接近基线模型。

Conclusion: GAM是一个高效的Transformer替代方案，在序列建模任务中表现出色，尤其适合长序列处理。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

Method: 对比分析了经过不同安全性对齐（审查与非审查）的模型在仇恨言论检测中的表现，并考查了它们的准确性、稳健性、对微妙语言的理解能力以及公平性差异。

Result: 安全性高度对齐的模型在准确性和稳健性上优于非对齐模型，但更容易因理想约束变得僵化，同时所有模型在理解讽刺等微妙语言和公平性上的表现存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管审查模型在性能上优于非审查模型，但它们的理想化约束与公平性问题凸显了更复杂审计框架的必要性。

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型尽管表现优异，但其动态资源分配需要高昂的训练开销，简单路由器难以承担复杂的路由任务。

Method: 提出了一种称为Router Upcycling的新路由技术，通过从前一注意力层中初始化多个路由器，协作地以注意力机制分配任务中的token给适合的专家。

Result: 实验表明，Router Upcycling方法优于其他MoE upcycling的基准模型，取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Router Upcycling优化了MoE upcycling模型，减少了训练成本，同时显著提升了模型性能，为动态资源分配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了14种小型语言模型(SLMs)生成虚假新闻标题的能力，并发现它们高度符合指令，但生成标题与真实新闻的相似度较低，且现有方法对假新闻质量的检测准确率偏低（35.2%-63.5%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型语言模型在生成虚假新闻标题方面的潜力及其与真实内容的相似性。

Method: 利用受控提示工程，为不同质量类别生成24,000个虚假新闻标题，并使用现有机器学习和深度学习模型（如DistilBERT、装袋分类器）评估其对标题质量的检测能力。

Result: SLMs高度符合生成虚假标题的需求，但对生成内容的质量检测准确率较低，生成标题与真实新闻内容的相似性较小。

Conclusion: SLMs在生成虚假新闻时具有高符合性，但现有检测机制难以有效区分其质量，显示出对于类似应用场景的伦理与实用性要求存在不足。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Motivation: 多模态时间序列预测依赖高质量文本与时间序列数据输入，但文本质量不足可能导致预测性能不稳定，因此需要改进文本内容以提升整体性能。

Method: 设计了一个名为TeR的文本增强模型，通过强化学习方法生成高质量的增强文本，优化基于增强文本的多模态TSF模型性能。

Result: 在多个实际数据集上的实验表明该方法优于现有基线模型，性能更为卓越。

Conclusion: 文本增强模型TeR显著改善了多模态时间序列预测的效果，为集成文本与时间序列数据预测开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服LLMs在使用用户评论进行推荐任务时的语境窗口限制和缺乏动态相关性优先机制的问题。

Method: 设计了RevBrowse框架，结合PrefRAG模块，将用户评论作为检索增强的内容融入推荐排序流程。

Conclusion: RevBrowse框架有效缓解了LLMs在推荐任务中的挑战，并提供了一定程度的可解释性，显示了用户评论在最终推荐决策中的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

### [249] [Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707)
*Daehoon Gwak,Minseo Jung,Junwoo Park,Minho Park,ChaeHun Park,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的解码策略Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)，通过全局奖励信号改善Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)的非自回归生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)的解码方法存在独立选择token的问题，导致生成顺序类似于自回归模型。

Method: 提出Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)，利用一个外部奖励模型，结合全局序列一致性对中间序列评估，并通过调整token置信度引导选择，从而更好地支持非自回归生成顺序。

Result: 实验表明，RWS显著改善了非自回归生成顺序，并在多个评价指标上提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入全局信号，RWS提高了MDMs的非自回归特性及整体性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a

principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

TL;DR: 本研究针对中文AI生成文本检测问题，对多种模型进行了比较，发现使用LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B在准确性和泛化能力上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的迅速发展，在检测AI生成文本特别是中文文本的需求日益上升。本研究旨在应对现有方法在中文语言上因细微语言差异而面临的挑战。

Method: 对比分析了基于编码器的Transformers（如BERT和RoBERTa）、基于解码器的模型（如Qwen2.5-7B），以及FastText基准模型，并使用一种新颖的基于提示的掩码语言建模方法对编码器模型进行微调，对Qwen2.5-7B进行LoRA微调以实现分类。

Result: 实验结果显示，编码器模型在分布偏移下性能下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%，BERT: 79.3%），而FastText虽然在词汇上表现较强（83.5%），但缺乏语义理解。LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B则取得了95.94%的测试准确率，并在精确率-召回率平衡上表现出色。

Conclusion: 解码器语言模型结合参数高效微调方法在中文AI生成文本检测中表现出显著优势，未来研究可探索Qwen3模型及其蒸馏变体和集成策略以进一步提升跨领域鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的基于事实分解的框架FIDES，用于改进大语言模型的问答归因问题，相较于现有方法提升了超过14%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通过生成问题来检索相关文档，但生成的问题往往不准确且不完整，导致事实丢失，同时难以整合多个文档中的证据。

Method: 提出了FIDES框架，采用上下文增强的两阶段分解方法，将长答案分解为子事实，再根据检索到的证据片段修订子事实并聚合证据。

Result: 通过六个数据集的广泛评估，使用新提出的自动化评估指标$Attr_{auto-P}$，FIDES性能超越SOTA方法超过14%。

Conclusion: 被改进的细粒度分解和证据聚合方法可以显著提高大语言模型在问答归因任务中的表现。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的法律人工智能任务：司法意见生成，使用LegalChainReasoner框架，解决了法律推理和刑罚预测分离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前法律人工智能研究将司法意见生成分为法律推理和刑罚预测两个独立任务，导致结果不一致。

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner，通过结构化法律链指导模型进行案例分析，实现端到端的法律推理和刑罚生成，同时支持知识的灵活注入。

Result: 实验表明，在两个真实世界和开源的中文法律案例数据集上，所提出的方法性能优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 该研究实现了更符合实际司法需求的意见生成方式，能够辅助进行司法分析和提高工作效率。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Method: 采用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过监督微调策略，使用BioASQ、MedQuAD和TREC等外部数据集编译的生物医学问答数据集，同时设计了三种实验设置并引入两阶段推理管道。

Result: 模型在语义理解上表现强劲，概念准确度高达0.8，但精确匹配分数较低，尤其在测试阶段，部分改进得益于两阶段推理策略。

Conclusion: 发现了语义理解与精确回答评估之间的差距，强调需进一步研究输出控制和结果后处理策略以提高性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Topic Model Translation (TMT) 的方法，可以在无需元数据、嵌入或对齐语料库的情况下将主题模型从一种语言转移到另一种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在多语言环境中训练主题模型十分困难，尤其是在目标语言数据有限或语料不可用的情况下。

Method: 引入了一种新方法TMT，其核心是无需元数据、嵌入或对齐语料库即可实现主题模型的语言转移。

Result: 通过定量与定性方法的广泛评估，证明TMT能够生成语义连贯且一致的主题翻译。

Conclusion: TMT方法对目标语言数据有限的情况特别有效，能够在多语言环境下高效复用主题模型。

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统数量增加，对其进行评价成为重要挑战。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1. 利用提示的方式用语言模型作为评估器；2. 训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。

Result: 通过提示的语言模型与人工评价的相关性有限，但在测试集上表现第二，仅次于基准模型；回归和分类模型在验证集某些维度上表现出较高相关性，但在测试集上表现有所下降。

Conclusion: 尽管性能有所局限性，但语言模型及基于编码器的模型在一定条件下能有效评估对话系统的质量，且受数据集注释范围差异影响较大。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

Motivation: 现有的文本嵌入模型需要更好的负样本生成策略以提高对语义细微差别的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出了多粒度困难负样本生成框架（MGH）和锚点词感知池化方法（ATA），分别通过LLMs合成多层次的困难样本，以及对锚点词赋权来优化模型。

Result: 在MTEB基准上进行的实验表明，该方法在使用合成数据与公开检索数据结合后优于现有方法，达到了最新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提高了文本嵌入模型的精度，展示了合成困难负样本和锚点词权重在模型训练中的重要性。

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Motivation: 探索文本生成图像模型在职业角色呈现中的社会性别与种族偏见，以引入方法减少或解决这些偏见问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含五种职业角色的基准测试，使用五个前沿模型在中性和公平提示下生成图像，并对输出中的性别与种族进行标注和分布性分析。

Result: 提示显著影响了生成的图像中性别和种族的分布，但模型间效果差异大：有的模型能有效多样化，有的过于校正出现不现实的均一性，还有的反应微弱。

Conclusion: 即使提示可以作为公平干预的一种手段，但仍需要模型层面的策略来补充，研究凸显了这一问题的复杂性及进一步优化的空间。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在应对误导性或欺骗性提示时的趋炎附势现象可能导致生成的回答偏离事实，需要一种方法来提高其生成内容的真实性和准确性。

Method: 设计了生成误导性输入的两种范式，基于此开发了协作对比解码（CCD）方法，通过对比中性输入与误导性输入的输出分布偏差，减少对误导信息的依赖，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码（CCD）提供了一种无需额外训练的有效方法，用于抑制趋炎附势现象，促进LLMs在各任务中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

Motivation: 目前大语言模型因检索证据噪音高及多跳推理误差累积问题，限制了其问答任务的表现。

Method: 提出 EviNote-RAG 框架，其中模型通过生成支持性证据记录（支持性笔记，SENs）总结相关信息，并利用证据质量奖励（EQR）强化这一过程。

Result: 实验表明，EviNote-RAG 在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性上优于现有方法，并在问答任务（如HotpotQA、Bamboogle和2Wiki）上显著提高F1得分。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG 有效解决了传统方法存在的不足，取得了最先进的性能，并提高了模型的稳健性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域的快速发展，讽刺、讽刺幽默的检测成为一个重要的研究方向，尤其是在与假新闻的区分方面具有重要作用。

Method: 作者提供了一个包含13,873条人工标注句子的句子级讽刺检测数据集SeLeRoSa，覆盖社会问题、IT、科学和电影等多个领域；并使用多种基于大型语言模型和基于Transformer的模型来评估数据集。

Result: 评估结果显示，在句子级讽刺检测任务中，当前的模型仍然存在局限性，尤其是在零样本和微调设置中表现不尽如人意。

Conclusion: 作者的数据集和研究结果表明，句子级讽刺检测是一个有难度但潜力巨大的任务，这为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

Conclusion: 基于生成响应任务的SIFT方法证明了LLMs在序列标注任务中的有效性，同时强调了解生成式方法优势的必要性，拓展了LLMs应用的新思路。

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

*Md Shahidul Salim,Lian Fu,Arav Adikesh Ramakrishnan,Zonghai Yao,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCOD框架通过整合特定领域的知识与大语言模型，提升了英语到西班牙语的医学翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种能够有效整合医学领域知识以提升翻译准确性的框架。

Method: 采用了MedCOD框架，将统一医学语言系统(UMLS)和LLM-KB结合，并通过LoRA微调多个大语言模型，同时利用包含结构化医学上下文的医学语料库进行评估。

Result: MedCOD显著提升了多个开源模型的翻译质量，例如Phi-4在结合MedCOD后BLEU评分达到44.23，显著优于GPT-4o等基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与LLM的结合在医学翻译任务中有巨大潜力，并能够实现显著的性能提升。

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Result: 揭示结构和非结构模式中的共同特征，并提出基于两者结合的新开发方式以提升模型适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为自然语言处理提供了一种结合两种开发范式的新方向，从而促进知识引擎的透明性、可控性和通用性发展。

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在医学问答中欠缺事实准确性和临床可靠性，亟需优化推理链以提升其实际应用能力。

Method: 提出一种被称为RPRO的框架，结合强化学习与基于偏好的推理优化；采用任务适配模板和概率评估机制来校正推理链；引入基于Bradley-Terry模型的群体排名优化和KL散度正则化方法。

Result: 实验在PubMedQA和MedQA-USMLE中验证了RPRO的有效性，1.1B参数模型在性能上超过了7B-13B的更大模型，包括医学专业化模型。

Conclusion: RPRO框架将偏好优化与高质量推理链优化结合，为构建更可靠、更具临床基础的医学语言模型提供了一种可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of
information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）在应对文化特定的交流规范方面表现薄弱，本研究通过引入首个涵盖波斯Taarof文化规范的基准工具TaarofBench，评估了五种LLMs在这种复杂文化语境中的表现并改进了模型的文化适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于大语言模型在多文化场景中的局限性，研究者试图针对波斯Taarof文化传统建立模型评估工具并优化其表现，解决模型不适应文化特定交互的现实问题。

Method: 本研究创建了TaarofBench，包含450个基于角色扮演的场景，对大语言模型理解Taarof文化的能力进行评估。此外，通过监督微调和直接偏好优化技术提升LLMs的文化适应能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs对Taarof文化的理解准确率低于母语者40-48%；经过优化，模型文化适应性分别提升了21.8%和42.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个专注于波斯Taarof文化的评估基准和优化方向，强调了多样化、文化意识型语言模型的开发重要性，推动模型在复杂社会语境中的应用能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

<details>

Motivation: 当前危机通信中自动化语言生成器的风格是否一致，直接影响受影响人群对回应者的信任。然而，保持风格一致性的方法研究较少。

Method: 作者提出一种新的风格一致性评价指标，并构建了基于该指标的两阶段融合生成方法，先评估候选回复的风格，再通过融合优化，提高整个回复的一致性和质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上整体超越现有基线模型，尤其在回复质量和风格一致性表现上明显优越。

Conclusion: 在危机通信情境下，本文方法有效提升了自动化生成回复的风格一致性和质量，这是提高受众信任的关键进展。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Method: 设计了包含1000个涉及不同继承场景的多选问题的基准测试，评估七个不同的大语言模型的理解能力和推理准确性，并进行了详细的错误分析。

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5的准确率超过90%，而ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral低于50%，表现显著不同。研究还揭示了模型在场景理解、法律规则应用和领域知识上的不足。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在结构化法律推理上的能力有限，未来需在领域适配和推理能力方面进行改进。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

Method: 采用历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究和母语者主观评价任务，验证完美体形式的不合语法性。

Result: 研究发现完美体形式的不合语法性是因为该结构要求与核心语法规则之间的形态句法冲突。

Conclusion: 由于形态句法冲突导致完美体形式失稳，现代语法通过替代结构使这种语法差异得以巩固。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统要求上传明文文档到云端，存在隐私泄露风险。PRAG虽然可编码文档但效率低且对分布外输入泛化性差，因此需要一种既高效又能保持RAG性能的隐私保护方案。

Method: 提出DistilledPRAG，一种知识蒸馏的参数化RAG模型，通过生成QA对促进多文档推理，并使用参数生成器将文档转为LoRA，同时匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态及输出，达到无需原始文档即可推理的效果。

Result: 在四个QA数据集上进行实验，DistilledPRAG在准确率上优于基线模型，并在分布外数据上具有良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG通过知识蒸馏与参数生成实现一套高效的隐私保护推理方法，同时保持了RAG的推理性能，解决了PRAG面临的效率和泛化性不足的问题。

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在RAG等多轮对话应用中表现出强大的知识扩展能力，但处理长上下文输入时存在延迟高、内存需求大等问题，导致知识扩展与系统效率之间存在基本权衡。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展的方式，优化RAG的解码过程，利用稀疏性结构减少无用计算并提升效率。

Result: REFRAG实现了30.85倍的首字生成加速（较之前方法提高3.75倍），没有损失困惑度，同时能将上下文长度扩展16倍。跨多种任务验证了其在效率和准确性上的优势。

Conclusion: REFRAG在处理长上下文任务中的效率和性能兼顾，为RAG、多轮对话以及长文档总结等场景提供了高效解码解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Motivation: 探讨自然文本演化是否对生成式LLMs在问答任务中的表现产生显著影响，从而深入理解其对语言演化的适应能力。

Method: 提出了一种框架，通过语义相似度量化基准数据中段落与预训练内容的接近程度，并评估6个QA数据集及8个LLMs在文本自然演化情况下的表现。

Result: 实验发现，随着文本语义相似性下降，模型表现显著下降。例如，在BoolQ数据集上，模型准确率从高相似度到低相似度降幅超过30%。

Conclusion: 自然文本演化对LLMs的语言理解能力构成了重大挑战，提示模型需要更好的适应真实世界文本变化。

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model

Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly

cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality

*Zhihao Zhang,Sophia Yat Mei Lee,Dong Zhang,Shoushan Li,Guodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Entity-Aligned Translation (EAT)的新方法，旨在提升非拉丁脚本语言的跨语言命名实体识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ZCL-NER方法对非拉丁脚本语言因其与高资源语言在结构上的显著差异导致性能下降，亟需一种方式提升这种语言间的知识迁移效率。

Method: 提出采用实体对齐翻译方法（EAT），通过大语言模型的双向翻译策略来实现实体对齐，并用多语言维基百科数据对语言模型进行微调。

Result: 引入EAT策略能够有效改进非拉丁脚本语言在跨语言命名实体识别任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 通过对大语言模型的实体对齐和微调方法，可以显著提升非拉丁脚本语言的零样本跨语言命名实体识别性能。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

TL;DR: 提出Tea-MOELoRA框架，利用LoRA与MoE结构，有效提取多个中文信息抽取任务中的异质信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理跨任务及不同时代的中文信息抽取时，存在干扰及性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合LoRA与Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)框架，Tea-MOELoRA通过多个低秩LoRA专家模块处理不同任务与时代，并通过路由机制动态分配任务。

Result: Tea-MOELoRA在多个信息抽取任务上的效果优于单任务及联合LoRA基线。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效利用任务与时代信息，提升中文信息抽取的性能。

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse
temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a
single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to
interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with
a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了SAT框架，通过结构感知对齐微调解决KGC中的挑战，并在任务中实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGC方法存在自然语言与图结构表示空间不一致的问题，以及为不同KGC任务设计独立指令导致的重复工作和低效问题。

Method: 提出SAT框架，包括：1.采用层次知识对齐，通过多任务对比学习将图嵌入对齐到自然语言空间；2.设计结构化指令调优，利用统一的图指令和轻量知识适配器引导LLMs进行结构感知的推理。

Result: 在两个KGC任务的四个基准数据集上，尤其是链路预测任务中，SAT明显优于现有最先进方法，提升8.7%到29.8%。

Conclusion: SAT框架解决了KGC中的关键问题，通过对LLMs进行结构感知增强，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在长上下文文本处理上的能力限制了真实世界多种应用的实现，而这一问题主要在于缺乏适合训练和评估的大量高质量长上下文数据集。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于提示与LLMs交互的合成长上下文数据生成框架，支持多种训练与对齐目标，以及四种主要的数据生成模式，包括多轮对话、基于文档的输入输出、可验证任务和长上下文推理示例。通过模板化提示、多元元数据的模型无关架构设计实现可控、可扩展的数据集创建。

Result: 该框架生成的数据通用于培训和评估，推动LLMs在长上下文处理能力上的进步。

Conclusion: 所提方法为长上下文能力的LLM模型提供了一套全面的、可扩展的解决方案，能够显著提升模型处理真实复杂输入的性能。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探索了AI系统中依赖自然语言带来的解释性歧义问题，并提出一种借鉴法律机制的计算框架以改进规则制定和应用的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖自然语言进行治理，然而解释性歧义问题未被充分研究，这种歧义可能导致系统行为不一致。

Method: 提出一种基于法律理论的计算框架，包括两个机制：（1）规则精炼管道，以减少解释性分歧；（2）基于提示的解释约束，以降低规则应用中的不一致性。

Result: 在5,000个WildChat数据集场景测试中，该框架显著提高了解释者之间的判断一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统化管理解释性歧义提供了基础，可以帮助构建更健全且遵循规则的AI系统。

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Conclusion: 零样本可调加速方法有效提高了推理效率，为构建高效体系结构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and

introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly

wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x
speedup compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SimulST系统难以平衡翻译质量、延迟性和语义一致性，尤其在多语种环境中，传统策略学习方法表现欠佳。

Method: 提出SimulMEGA方法，结合前缀训练与混合专家筛选器，通过隐式学习方式优化读写策略，无需增加推理阶段的计算开销，并将框架与标准Transformer融合以实现跨任务通用。

Result: 在六对语言中测试，500M模型在1.5秒平均延迟时BLEU下降不到7%，3秒时下降低于3%，并在流式TTS任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: SimulMEGA框架实现了在高精度翻译与低延迟条件下的良好平衡，且方法简洁通用，适用面广。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨了模型增长策略在缓解大语言模型中的灾难性遗忘问题上的效果。研究发现，增长预训练模型在领域知识、推理和阅读理解中表现更优，部分缓解遗忘现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过模型增长策略来缓解大语言模型在连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，以维持跨领域能力的稳定性。

Method: 使用模型增长策略（Stack LLM），通过小模型加速和结构化训练大模型，同时与未使用增长策略的基线模型进行对比评估。

Result: 增长模型在领域知识保留上效果更好，读解任务的下降较少，偏好指标维持稳定；而基线模型存在认知退化与倾向减弱的问题。

Conclusion: 模型增长策略对提高知识保留有一定效用，但在处理社会偏见和其他权衡方面仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务中表现优异，但在特定领域中表现不佳，需要针对特定数据进行微调，并希望找到一种方法快速选择最佳模型以进行微调。

Method: 从数据层面提出数据过滤方法分类；增强文本关键token密度并使用LLM优化文本表达；模型层面对层重要性进行评估并删除低重要性层，同时引入稀疏融合方法以保留原模型能力。

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上进行实验，证明可选择最佳LLM并节省约20倍的训练时间。

Conclusion: 框架DaMoC能够通过数据和模型压缩显著提升模型微调效率，为领域任务模型优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Motivation: 虽然Chain-of-Thought推理方法在提高模型推理能力方面取得了显著成果，但其工作机制仍不清晰。本文旨在探索Chain-of-Thought推理背后的机制，尤其是其与预训练先验和上下文学习之间的关系。

Method: 研究中通过细粒度的词汇层面分析、引入噪声示例及提示工程实验，分析模型的推理行为与机制。

Result: 主要发现包括：(1) 模型能够快速学习逻辑推理结构，但强烈依赖于预训练先验；(2) 提供充足示例可以将模型决策转向上下文信号，而误导性提示会引发不稳定性；(3) 长的Chain-of-Thought提示能够诱导模型生成更长的推理链并提升下游任务的表现。

Conclusion: 探索表明，平衡预训练先验和上下文信息，以及优化提示设计，可显著改善大语言模型的推理效率和表现。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Method: 对工业语料库进行人工标注，使用语言模型对标注过程进行建模并分析语言特性与标注一致性之间的关系。

Result: 模型能够反映标注过程并发现语言特性对变异性的驱动作用，同时可基于评估标准区分情绪场景。

Conclusion: 评估性方法能为情绪分析提供新的视角，语言模型有效捕捉情绪相关特性。

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

TL;DR: 当前针对大型语言模型文化适配性的评估方法过于简化和 trivia（琐碎）化，作者主张以更系统和刻意考虑文化假设的方式对模型进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法以琐碎的、多选题或简答题的方式将文化简化为静态事实，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性，以及文化假设如何渗透到表面上“中立”的评估设置中。

Method: 提出了一种“有意的文化评估”方法，通过系统性地检查评估过程中嵌入的文化假设，并强调研究者立场对包容性和文化对齐NLP研究的重要性。

Result: 阐述了文化相关挑战在评估中产生的方式、缘由，并与人机交互式的参与性方法结合，为未来的评估设计提供新方向。

Conclusion: 当前的评估实践需要超越benchmark，为尚未识别的应用发现价值，并通过社区参与设计出更加多元和文化对齐的评估方法。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Motivation: 大语言模型在表格问答任务中的表现受到数据结构异构性、数据定位困难以及复杂推理能力不足的限制，尤其在工业化应用中具有挑战性。

Method: 提出TableZoomer框架，包括：1）通过表结构化替代完全语言化表格以降低语义复杂性；2）采用意识化查询的表格缩放机制生成子表，以便快速定位数据；3）使用‘思想编程’策略，将查询转化为可执行代码以减少数据误差，并融合ReAct范式以支持迭代推理。

Result: 实验表明，与传统方法相比，TableZoomer在DataBench数据集上的准确率提升了19.34%，在TableBench数据集上的准确率提升了25%。

Conclusion: TableZoomer不仅保留了大语言模型的易用性优势，还在多范围表格问答中表现出更大的性能改进和扩展能力，具有较好的工业应用前景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型尽管有很强的通用性，但在低资源领域的适应能力有限，而且针对新领域进行微调成本高昂，训练数据往往不足。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术（PEFTs）在高资源数据集上微调，并通过不同领域之间的语言内在相似性提升低资源领域的性能。评估了六种PEFTs在14个不同领域数据集上的表现。

Result: 在低资源领域表现中，使用Within-Domain Adapters推理效果优于少样本学习和更大的模型（如Llama-3-70B-Instruct）。即使缺乏领域内适配器，也可通过Cross-Domain Adapters和适配器策略组合改善表现。

Conclusion: 通过探索领域之间的语言相似性及参数高效微调方法，可在低资源领域中显著提升语言模型的适应性和性能。这种方法为解决低资源领域适配问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

TL;DR: LongCat-Flash是一个5600亿参数的专家混合（MoE）语言模型，其亮点包括动态计算资源分配的零计算专家和提高推理效率的Shortcut-connected MoE设计，并在规模庞大的训练和推理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是设计一个高效且具有先进智能能力的超大规模语言模型，满足可扩展性和高效性需求。

Result: 成功训练了一个基于20万亿标记数据的语言模型，其推理速度超过每秒100 tokens，成本约为每百万输出标记0.7美元，在多项评估中表现领先，尤其擅长代理任务。

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash展现出卓越的推理性能和代理能力，其开源有助于促进社区研究和应用。

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

### [292] [KoBLEX: Open Legal Question Answering with Multi-hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01324)
*Jihyung Lee,Daehui Kim,Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为KoBLEX的评估基准，用于评估大语言模型(LLM)在法律领域的多跳推理能力，同时提出了一种名为ParSeR的方法来提供参数化法律依据以指导回答，实验结果表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法律基准未能很好地评估LLM的开放性和基于条文的法律问答能力，文章旨在解决这一评估难题。

Method: 提出KoBLEX评估基准和ParSeR方法，前者包括法律场景问答数据集及支持性条文，后者通过三阶段检索结合LLM生成参数化条文指导回答，同时引入LF-Eval指标评估答案的法律性。

Result: ParSeR在多个LLM上的表现优于基准方法，与GPT-4比较，F1指标提高37.91，LF-Eval提高30.81，且在多跳推理深度上的表现一致。

Conclusion: 本文证明了ParSeR在法律推理问答任务中的高效性和可靠性，并强调了参数化条文和LF-Eval指标在提升法律问答性能中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂卡牌游戏中的能力，发现通过高质量数据进行微调，LLMs可接近强AI表现，并能同时掌握多个复杂游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）是否在复杂卡牌游戏中能展现出类似AlphaGo等AI的成功。

Method: 评估LLMs在八款多样化卡牌游戏中的学习能力，研究高质量游戏数据微调的效果，并结合一般性指令数据来减轻能力衰退。

Result: LLMs通过监督微调可接近强AI表现，能同时掌握相似规则的游戏，但在掌握复杂游戏时一般能力会下降。

Conclusion: LLMs展示了强学习能力和多样性，在适当条件下可以在复杂卡牌游戏中取得良好表现。

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

*Mohammad Zbeeb,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究展示了复杂推理能力可以通过简单的张量算术从一个模型提取并转移到另一个模型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高成本的优化如强化学习在训练推理能力中至关重要，但如果可以低成本地移植这种能力，将显著提高效率。

Method: 提取两个相同初始化但不同训练方式（SFT和GRPO）的Qwen2.5模型间的任务向量$v_{\text{reason}}$，并将其添加到其他相容模型中以提高推理性能。

Result: 在多个推理基准上证明该方法有效，例如GSM8K提高4.9%，HumanEval提高4.3%，且性能提升在对抗条件下仍然存在。

Conclusion: 通过轻量化的向量操作，推理能力可以从开源模型中提取并复用，有效降低开发和训练成本。

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了WATCHED，一个结合大语言模型与多种工具的AI聊天机器人，用于支持内容审核者处理仇恨言论，其性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字空间中在线危害问题日益严重，尤其是仇恨言论迫切需要高效且值得信赖的检测与解释工具，来提升用户安全和社交媒体平台的可信度。

Method: 研究提出了WATCHED，一个结合大语言模型、BERT分类器及多种辅助工具的AI系统，用以检测并清晰解释仇恨言论的决定依据。同时，它对比仇恨和中立内容，利用Urban Dictionary解析俚语，并根据平台准则生成推理链条解释。

Result: 实验结果表明，WATCHED的宏F1评分达到了0.91，优于现有方法，展现出明显的性能优势。

Conclusion: WATCHED为内容审核者和研究人员提供了一个结合人工智能和人类监督的强大工具，有助于减轻在线仇恨言论并提升平台安全性与用户信任。

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

*Serwar Basch,Ilia Kuznetsov,Tom Hope,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种领域无关的框架，用于生成跨文档链接的数据集并优化链接方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对于自动化跨文档链接创建的研究由于缺乏高效数据集生成方法而受限。

Method: 通过生成半合成文档数据集进行评估，并结合人类评价，优化跨文档链接方法。

Result: 在两个领域（同行评审和新闻）中验证，发现结合检索模型和LLMs的方式能取得78%的链接认可率，比单独使用检索方法的精确度提高了一倍多。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统化研究跨文档理解提供了基础，并贡献了新数据集以推进诸如媒体分析和同行评审等任务。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究NAC生成的离散语音符号是否遵循语言统计规律，并如何影响语义和声学表现。

Method: 对NAC符号的统计规律（如Zipf定律和Heaps定律）、熵、冗余进行分析，并通过语音识别错误率和质量分数评估其在语义和声学保持上的关系。

Result: NAC符号（尤其是3-grams）呈现出类似语言的统计规律，并且信息内容的特性与语音识别和重生成性能的提升相关联。

Conclusion: 这些结果提供了对NAC符号序列结构的深入理解，并为设计更高效的语音生成模型提供了指导。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在数学问题上表现良好，但在元推理任务如识别学生解答中的错误时表现较弱。本文通过研究如何定位解题步骤中的第一个错误，提出了生成中间修正解法以提升性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何解决大型语言模型在定位学生解题过程中的第一个错误步骤时的挑战。

Method: 提出通过生成中间修正解答，与原学生解法更好地一致，从而帮助模型更精准地定位错误。

Result: 实验结果显示现有最先进模型难以做到精确定位错误，而提出的方法显著改善了性能。

Conclusion: 生成中间修正解答是一种有效的方法，可改进语言模型在元推理任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Vis-CoT框架，将线性推理转换为交互式推理图，实现人机协作以提高模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs的推理过程缺乏透明性，难以在高风险场景下验证、调试和控制。

Method: 构建Vis-CoT框架，将线性链式推理文本转化为交互式推理图，引入人类对推理过程的可视化识别和修正机制。

Result: 实验证明Vis-CoT在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上提高最终回答准确率最高可达24个百分点，并显著提升用户感知的可用性和信任度。

Conclusion: Vis-CoT框架结合LLMs与人类干预，提出可靠、可理解且具协作性的推理新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

*Yang Liu,Masahiro Kaneko,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型(LLMs)与全球不同国家、语言和历史时期人类观点对齐的问题，提出了基于世界价值观调查的评估框架，并发现提示语言的变化可以引导模型更有效地对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于LLMs对齐研究主要集中在美国或少数几个国家，并未涵盖全球国家样本和历史时期的研究，也忽略了提示语言对模型观点对齐的潜在影响。本文旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 采用世界价值观调查(WVS)构建评估框架，研究LLMs在全球范围内与不同国家、语言和历史时期人类观点的对齐情况，并测试不同提示语言对对齐效果的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs的观点与少数国家过度对齐，而与大多数国家不足。另外，提示语言与问卷语言一致时，模型对该国观点对齐效果优于现有方法，同时对当代人群观点的对齐更优。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统性探索了LLMs在全球、语言和时间维度上的观点对齐问题，提供了新的方法并发布了代码及数据集以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/nlply/global-opinion-alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UniCR的框架，用于在多种场景下提升语言模型的不确定性校准和回答可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高语言模型在不确定性下做出是否回答决策的能力，同时优化校准可信度。

Method: 通过统一框架UniCR，将不确定性依据（包括序列可能性、自洽性分散、检索兼容性以及工具反馈等）转化为校准的正确性概率，基于用户错误预算提供拒绝回答决策。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成以及检索增强长问答等任务中，UniCR相比其他方法在校准指标、风险覆盖曲线以及特定风险覆盖率等方面均有显著提升，并有效减少语义偏差导致的错误回答。

Conclusion: UniCR能改进语言模型的可信度，提供用户友好的拒绝策略，在无需精调基础模型的情况下增强模型的可信任性和适应性。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

*Yuchen Wu,Liang Ding,Li Shen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reason-KE是一种新型知识编辑框架，通过推理链方法有效更新大型语言模型中的知识，同时保持高效与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在训练后无法动态更新知识，传统的知识编辑技术效率低且易受干扰，难以应对多跳推理情境中的噪声。

Method: 提出Reason-KE框架，采用四个推理阶段：事实认知、相关性判断、选择性应用和最终推理，从而实现对分散干扰的精确过滤。模型通过单次处理实现知识编辑。

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，Reason-KE提升了Qwen2.5-7B模型的多跳问答准确率至90.2%，在干扰强烈情况下准确率仅下降6.3%。

Conclusion: Reason-KE框架有效解决了知识编辑的复杂性和效率问题，成为大型语言模型知识更新的新标杆。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有研究中，关于如何缓解语言模型的“幻觉问题”的方法还没有充分探讨能否确保检索增强语言模型在未知情况下可以正确拒绝。从而激发了该研究的深入探讨。

Method: 研究通过分析RALM的内部和外部知识状态的校准，探讨拒绝后训练（R-tuning）及上下文微调对拒绝能力的影响，并提出了一种改进方法以优化回答质量。

Result: 发现LLM表现出“过度拒绝”现象，上下文微调可缓解该问题，而拒绝后训练可能加剧问题。进一步的优化方法在拒绝和回答正确性上均有提升。

Conclusion: 研究为如何优化语言模型的拒绝能力与回答质量提供了全新见解，特别是在探索RALMs的拒绝能力和优化平衡两个方面具有重要启示。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

### [304] [MeVe: A Modular System for Memory Verification and Effective Context Control in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01514)
*Andreas Ottem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有RAG系统由于使用简单的top-k语义搜索方法导致上下文中加入了无关或冗余信息，性能和效率下降。MeVe提出了一种新的模块化架构，通过五个可调节阶段精细控制知识获取流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统由于语义搜索的限制，内容经常受无关信息的影响，导致性能下降，需要一种更高效和可控的上下文构建方式。

Method: 提出MeVe架构，将检索和上下文构成的流程分为检索、验证、回退检索、优先排序和token预算五个阶段，并通过任务驱动的调整优化知识的利用。

Result: MeVe在知识密集的问答任务中表现优于传统RAG，实现了Wikipedia数据集上下文的57%优化及HotpotQA数据集的75%优化。

Conclusion: MeVe通过精炼和过滤上下文信息，为大规模语言模型应用提供了更稳健和高效的参考框架，提高了信息准确性和上下文效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

*Thomas Compton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较分析了两种社区工会模式：20世纪20年代的国家靴鞋工会（B&S）和2010年代至2020年代的Unite Community，利用现代NLP技术探讨它们的主题差异及与社区工会关键特征的对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同历史与组织背景下的社区工会模式，探讨主题差异及其关键特征与社区工会的对应情况，挑战其普遍性与连续性假设。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模、cTF-IDF加权及词频分析，分析这两工会话语与社区工会特征的对齐程度。

Result: Unite Community更符合社会正义为导向的主题，B&S更关注内部管理与工业关系。两者展现了截然不同的社区参与模式。

Conclusion: 尽管两者体现某种社区主题的联系，但其内在模式差异较大，现代NLP方法的应用也显示出分析历史劳动档案的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

*Kairong Han,Wenshuo Zhao,Ziyu Zhao,JunJian Ye,Lujia Pan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型在预测和生成中是否能够有效利用因果知识，提出了一种新的因果注意力调节方法（CAT），实验验证了其在多项任务中的表现和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型已在多领域取得成功，但其常倾向捕获伪相关而非真实因果关系，尤其在分布外场景中表现不佳，因此需要一个能注入因果知识的改进方法。

Method: 提出因果注意力调节（CAT）方法，通过一种自动化流程生成细粒度因果信号，并引入再注意力机制（Re-Attention）引导训练，使模型专注于因果结构，同时减轻注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在Spurious Token Game (STG)基准和多个下游任务中的实验验证表明，CAT方法能够有效利用因果知识进行预测，并在分布外场景中保持稳健性。

Conclusion: 因果注意力调节方法显著改善了模型对因果知识的利用能力，并提升了其在预测和分布外场景中的性能表现，为大型语言模型注入因果意识提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

TL;DR: 本研究探讨通过将API文档转化为结构化API图，以优化基于LLM的工具代理在处理复杂任务时的表现，并提出了In-N-Out数据集以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具代理在处理复杂任务时，难以正确调用API，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将API文档转为结构化API图，捕捉API依赖关系，并利用In-N-Out这一人工标注的API图数据集进行模型微调和优化。

Result: 使用In-N-Out实现了工具检索和多工具查询生成性能的大幅提升，模型表现几乎提升了一倍。

Conclusion: API图在工具代理领域具有巨大潜力，In-N-Out数据集是宝贵的资源，将公开发布供研究者使用。

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准方法EAGLE，通过提取和聚合LLMs多个中间层的内部信念，提高了模型置信度评分的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型存在过度自信的问题，尤其在经过RLHF训练后，导致其不可靠的置信度估计和部署风险增加。

Method: 通过在自评估中利用LLMs的内部隐藏状态，从多层提取内部信念，聚合成置信度分布并计算其期望值，从而生成更精确的置信度评分。

Result: EAGLE在多样化的数据集和模型上表现出比现有基线方法更好的校准性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE有效提升了大语言模型的置信度评估能力，并通过多种层面分析验证其效果和适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨句子嵌入空间的几何结构是否能预测在多种任务上的相对性能，结果发现嵌入空间的几何性与任务性能之间并无直接关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究句子嵌入的几何性质是否能反映或预测句子在不同语言任务中的表现。

Method: 通过三种方法生成句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、[CLS]特殊符号嵌入和句中随机词嵌入；分析这些嵌入间的几何距离与任务性能表现的相关性。

Result: 句子嵌入间的余弦相似性只能捕捉浅层共性，仅几何结构无法预测句子嵌入在不同语言任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 语言信息是通过不同维度按权重组合编码，嵌入空间的几何特性并非任务性能的可靠指标。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

TL;DR: 本论文提出一个新基准，用于检测由大语言模型生成的现代中文诗歌，发现现有检测工具难以辨别人工创作与AI生成的诗歌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现代中文诗歌的独特性，以及AI生成文本对诗歌生态系统的干扰，迫切需要能够准确检测AI生成诗歌的方法。

Method: 作者创建了一个高质量数据集，包括800首由专业诗人创作的诗歌和41,600首由四种主流LLMs生成的诗歌，并使用六种检测工具对其进行系统评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，目前的检测工具难以可靠地识别由LLMs生成的现代中文诗歌，尤其难以检测与风格相关的内在特性。

Conclusion: 研究验证了该基准的有效性和必要性，为未来检测AI生成诗歌奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT 是一种结合 Transformer 和图注意网络（GAT）的自动作文评分模型，在ELLIPSE数据集上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动作文评分基于静态词嵌入，无法捕捉上下文含义，且多注重整体评分而忽略具体写作方面。

Method: 提出 TransGAT，结合细调的 Transformer 和 GAT 进行双流预测，融合生成最终评分。

Result: 在 ELLIPSE 数据集上，TransGAT 的平均 QWK 分数为 0.854，优于基准模型。

Conclusion: TransGAT 有潜力显著提升自动作文评分系统的分析能力。

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常通过表面语义线索（如词法模式、情感词等）检测假新闻，但在动态环境中表现效果有限。本研究旨在通过引入新闻意图的分析，以更深层次理解新闻欺骗的内在逻辑，对假新闻检测方式做出改进。

Method: 提出了InSide方法，通过将新闻的语义和意图信号重构为异构图，结合意图建模和动态路径对齐策略，促进语义与意图信号之间的深度联合与信息传递。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，与现有最先进方法相比，InSide的检测效果更优。

Conclusion: 通过将新闻意图与语义联合建模，提出的InSide方法能够更准确地识别假新闻，并在动态环境中展现出更优的性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对阿尔及利亚方言的字符级预训练语言模型（chDzDT），填补了该领域模型的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自然语言处理技术在阿尔及利亚方言上的表现受限，因为这种方言的复杂语形、混杂语码和多种语言与字符的影响使得传统的分词方法效果不佳。

Method: chDzDT 使用字符级表示而非传统词或子词分割学习，并从多个来源构建多脚本预训练语料库，包括 YouTube 评论、多种语言的 Wikipedia 和 Tatoeba 项目。

Result: 实验表明，chDzDT 在处理形态复杂、资源稀缺的方言任务中效果良好，展示了字符级建模的潜力。

Conclusion: 该模型为对形态复杂语言和低资源方言展开更具包容性和适应性的自然语言处理系统打下了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

TL;DR: 现有研究认为提示敏感性是LLM的局限，但该研究发现其更可能是评估过程的产物而非模型的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨广泛接受的提示敏感性是否真的是LLM的内在问题，还是评估方式的假象。

Method: 对7个LLM（如GPT和Gemini）在6个基准和12种提示模板下进行系统性评估，并采用LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法。

Result: 发现提示敏感性主要源于启发式评估方法的缺陷，而非模型本身问题，使用LLM-as-a-Judge后显著减少了表现波动。

Conclusion: 现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性被低估，提示敏感性更多是评估过程的副产品而非模型缺陷。

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Conclusion: 所研发的模型在提高EHR信息提取效率与质量方面具有重要意义，可以辅助临床医生做出更优决策，从而改善患者护理结果。

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗主诉表述不统一难以标准化的问题，便于记录和文本挖掘。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在没有人工标注的情况下，优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 弱监督实体抽取和链接方法（\ours）可高效、自动化地处理医疗主诉数据，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用大语言模型(LLMs)辅助法官解决跨领域纠纷的可能性，通过系统生成结构化概述并提出纠纷解决建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纠纷无处不在，常需通过法官裁决。研究旨在探索如何利用LLMs来辅助法官决策，从而高效、公正地解决纠纷。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，利用LLMs从汽车保险和域名纠纷中提取关键要素生成结构化总结，并通过多种提示策略引导LLMs输出包括整体判断、具体需求和论点评估在内的决策。

Result: LLMs在多个层次的任务中表现接受评估，并与相关基线进行比较以验证其性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可用于某些纠纷裁决任务，但具体效能仍需进一步验证。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

*Chao Xue,Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了StructCoh，一个结合结构推理与表示空间优化的图增强对比学习框架，以解决文本语义匹配中对层级结构模式及细粒度语义区分的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练语言模型能够捕获词级交互，但通常无法充分理解文本的层级结构模式，以及难以处理细微的语义差异。因此，提出方法以更好地处理这些问题。

Method: 采用双图编码器，通过依赖解析和主题建模构建语义图，并使用图同构网络传播结构特性。同时设计了分层对比目标，以节点和文档结构语义级别的对比学习保持一致性。

Result: 在法律文件匹配及学术抄袭检测基准测试中显著优于最新方法。在法律法规匹配中，StructCoh达到了86.7%的F1得分，比现有方法提高了6.2%的绝对值。

Conclusion: StructCoh通过结构和对比学习的有机结合，实现了语义匹配性能的显著提升，特别是在识别论点结构相似性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在纵向患者叙事解读能力，尤其针对牙科数据，以验证其推理能力并探讨其在专业医学领域的潜力。

Method: 研究测试了四款先进LLM（GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot和DeepSeek V3），利用34个标准化的纵向牙周病例，结合自动化指标与执业牙医的盲测评价进行性能评估。

Result: DeepSeek展现了最高的忠实性性能（中值分数为0.528，对比其他LLM范围为0.367-0.457），并获得了专家较高的评分（中值4.5/5，对比其他为4.0/5），同时其可读性并未显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明DeepSeek在案例分析中表现出色，适合作为医学教育和研究的辅助工具，具有成为领域特定代理工具的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Genetic Prompt的新框架，通过结合遗传算法与大语言模型（LLM），增强合成数据生成过程的质量与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，大语言模型虽擅长生成合成数据，但确保其质量与多样性仍然具有挑战性，因而需要探索更优的方法。

Method: 将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用遗传算法中的交叉和变异机制，与LLM结合进行数据生成，并集成主动学习方式优化父代选择，扩展后代搜索空间。

Result: 实验表明，Genetic Prompt在多个NLP任务中显著优于最新基线方法，且在不同模型规模与生成器上表现鲁棒。此外，将生成数据融入原始数据集后能显著提高下游模型性能，尤其针对类别不均衡的场景。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是一种高效的方法，可为多种NLP应用生成高质量的合成数据，其创新性和产出价值均经过实验证实。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基础模型和指令微调模型在生成固定长度文本中的差异，发现指令微调有效提高了长度控制能力，尤其体现在模型的深层组件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何使大语言模型更好地生成固定长度的文本，并了解指令微调与基础模型的内在差异。

Method: 使用累积加权归因（Cumulative Weighted Attribution）指标分析指令微调对模型生成长度控制的影响，研究了模型组件的作用。

Result: 指令微调显著提升了长度控制能力，特别是在深层注意力机制和最终层MLP中体现出任务适应性，英文和意大利文分别表现出不同的机制调整。

Conclusion: 指令微调重新配置了模型深层组件，从而增强了模型在生成特定长度文本任务中的适应性，不同语言表现出语言定制化的调整策略。

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

TL;DR: 提出了一种对比推理提示优化（CRPO）框架，通过从高低质量的提示示例中学习改进自动提示优化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的提示优化方法多集中于直接优化或模型微调，忽略了利用LLM内在推理能力从对比示例中学习的可能性。

Method: 提出CRPO框架，利用HelpSteer2数据集中的高质量提示，构建分层对比推理和多指标对比推理两种优化策略，通过对比高低质量提示示例分析优劣，优化生成的提示。

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试上，CRPO方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 对比推理结合检索增强是一种有前景的方法，可提升自动提示优化的效果。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的评估方法存在交互不足、难度控制有限及评估结果有效性验证困难等问题，难以准确界定模型能力边界。

Result: 实验结果表明，JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式能够准确有效地进行模型评估，并验证了评估方法的可行性。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent强化了评估过程的交互性和适应性，为大语言模型能力的精准评估提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合文本和图像信息的新方法CMRAG，用于改进复杂文档问答任务的性能，显著优于仅视觉方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对多模态文档的处理存在局限，难以同时有效利用文本和图像信息，导致子最优的生成结果。

Method: 通过结构化分析获取文档的文本段和图像区域的共模态表示，随后进行文本和图像双通道的证据检索，最后利用视觉语言模型生成基于共模态结果的响应。

Result: 实验表明，CMRAG在视觉文档问答任务中明显优于纯视觉RAG方法。

Conclusion: 将共模态信息整合到RAG框架中是一种改进复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效方式。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型中的社会偏见问题仍未解决，而现有的偏见缓解方法多偏向西方背景，无法有效应对印度语境中特有的种姓和宗教问题。

Method: 提出了一个名为AMBEDKAR的框架，使用基于印度宪法的解码层仅在推理时运行，并结合推测性解码算法，通过使小语言模型生成，宪法指导的大语言模型作为验证器，形成了一种新的“通过推测实现公平”范式。

Result: 与基准相比，偏见绝对减少最多达26.41%。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架成功减少了印度语境中特有的语言模型输出偏见，同时避免了重新训练的成本，且效果显著且代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于超大多语言LMs进行微调，这在内存或延迟受限的环境下不可行，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 替换部分自回归目标为MAML训练，并在不同模型规模范围内(11M-570M)测试其效果，以探讨零样本迁移和快速适应性能。

Result: MAML在零样本微调场景中提升了微-F1指标2-6个百分点，在完全微调后提升1-3个百分点，同时减少达成收敛的时间高达8%。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了小型解码器LMs配合MAML在低资源语言NER任务中的可行性，特别在含表面锚点的实例上取得显著收益。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的解码策略——回避解码，通过惩罚生成文本与先前输出的相似度，来提升生成文本的多样性和减少重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型因相同输入提示产生重复、单调输出的问题，特别是在故事生成任务中。

Method: 通过一种回避解码策略，在生成文本时通过调整token的logits，设置两种惩罚模式：(1) 概念级别的相似性惩罚——在生成初期多样化故事概念；(2) 故事叙述级别的相似性惩罚——后期保证情节自然发展，同时保持多样性。

Result: 相比其他解码方法，该方法提升了生成文本的多样性至2.6倍，重复性降低30%，并有效抑制了文本退化。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了生成文本的多样性，还激活了模型更多的神经元，展现了模型的潜在创造力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks

We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the
fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在语言能力强的同时，还存在幻觉、偏见、隐私问题和计算成本高等局限性，需要更高效、可解释的替代方法。

Method: 通过基础语言模型范式（FLM），构建更小型的语言模型以外部工具进行事实检索，并评估了不同参数规模模型的语言能力及事实知识。

Result: 研究发现语言能力和事实知识随模型规模提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型大小主要关联记忆而非语言能力。

Conclusion: 支持一种模块化语言建模法，通过紧凑高效的语言模型结合外部工具，实现更高效、可解释及可持续的NLP解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

*Katharine Kowalyshyn,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为对话注释器和差异检测器的新框架。对此话框架在评估团队共享心理模型（SMM）方面的有效性展开了一系列实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望探索LLMs在推断团队共同理解（SMM）及检测团队成员间理解偏差中的潜力。

Method: 采用两步框架：第一步是通过LLMs从团队对话中提取SMM元素；第二步分析这些注释与人类注释间的偏差。最后构建用于评估SMM一致性的标准。

Result: 在六个对话场景中实施该框架，生成一组人类和LLMs注释数据，同时开发了可复现的SMM一致性评估标注框架，揭示LLMs在空间推理或语音注释方面的不足。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在简单对话注释中表现一致性，但在空间判断及语境歧义处理上存在系统化错误。

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO)的新方法，优化了大语言模型的强化学习训练，显著超越了目前的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GRPO）零梯度问题，提高大语言模型的推理能力与生成数据的利用效率。

Method: 采用动态剪辑策略根据token的先验概率自适应调整剪辑范围，并通过平滑优势标准化技术提升奖励的利用效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现先进，例如在AIME24基准上，显著超越GRPO和DAPO的性能，同时提升非零优势约28%，训练效率翻倍，并大幅减少了剪辑率。

Conclusion: DCPO在增强生成数据利用效率上是一个有效的方法，显著改善了强化学习中大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Conclusion: 隐式推理在LLMs中的优势显著，新方法的分类和分析为后续研究与应用提供了思路和实现框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本时间序列意见分析方法未能充分利用时间相关的细粒度注释，限制了其在趋势分析和预测等应用中的潜力。

Method: 将意见挖掘的现有框架整合至声明式 LLM 注释流水线，无需手动编写提示，并基于情感与意见挖掘定义了三个数据模型用于结构化表示；通过两个 LLM 进行注释，计算了细粒度意见维度上的标注一致性。

Result: 生成的知识库包含时间对齐的结构化意见，并适用于检索增强生成（RAG）、时间问题回答和时间轴总结等应用。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了当前方法在时间相关细粒度意见注释方面的空白，为结构化时间序列意见分析提供了强大工具。

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Motivation: 随着社会远程医疗的普及，大量医疗数据被生成，利用这些数据进行疾病分类具有重要意义。

Method: 研究评估了文本总结、优化和命名实体识别等三种文本预处理方式，并结合三个微调的阿拉伯语Transformer模型，通过集成学习方法改进分类性能。

Result: 利用各种文本表示和模型预测的集成方法，本研究达到了80.56%的最佳分类准确率。

Conclusion: 首次将LLM预处理与阿拉伯语Transformer模型及集成学习结合，为阿拉伯语医疗文本分类建立了新方法。

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过感知情绪建模改进性格检测的新方法—EmoPerso，利用自监督学习模型并在优化过程中联合学习情绪和性格。实验结果表明其优于以前的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前性格检测需要大量高质量标注数据，同时忽略了性格与情绪间的相互影响。提出一种新方法以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出EmoPerso框架：采用自监督学习生成合成数据并学习表示；通过多任务学习结合伪标注的情绪特征和性格预测；应用跨注意力模块捕获性格与情绪间细粒度交互；实施自学策略增强推理能力。

Result: 对两个基准数据集的广泛实验表明，EmoPerso超越现有模型表现。

Conclusion: EmoPerso是一种创新性框架，通过情绪感知建模显著提升性格检测效果，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探索了大型语言模型（LLM）是否真正能整合外部定义，发现其在任务求解中主要依赖内化知识，尤其是在一般任务中；而在领域特定任务中，更能从显式定义中获益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM在任务求解中是否优先整合外部定义知识，还是主要依赖其内化知识。

Method: 通过在多个解释基准数据集上的实验，测试专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和替换定义等不同条件下的模型表现。

Result: 显式标签定义可以提升任务的准确性和可解释性，但LLM在任务求解时并不总是可靠地整合这些定义，而是更常依赖其内化表示。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLM在普通任务中更依赖内化知识，而在领域特定任务中更倾向于受益于显式定义；因此需要更深入地理解LLM如何处理外部知识及其现有能力。

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型开发者承诺其模型遵循行为指南，但尚无系统审计评估其实际表现的工具，研究旨在填补这一空白，确保模型行为与规范的一致性。

Method: 通过解析行为声明、生成针对性提示并使用模型自身进行合规性评估，研究设计了一个审计框架，聚焦于开发者规范、模型输出及模型评估器之间的三方一致性。

Result: 对来自6家开发者的16个模型进行的测试显示，不同开发者模型存在系统性不一致，部分模型的合规性差距高达20%。

Conclusion: 该研究为基础模型的合规性测试提供了必要的基准工具，同时揭示了当前模型在满足开发者行为规范上的不足之处，为模型开发和改进提供了参考方向。

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Motivation: 解决当前奖励模型过度依赖大规模标记偏好数据的问题，并在模型中加入显式推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种自训练方法，利用未标记数据进行奖励推理，这种方法使模型可以生成偏好标签和奖励理由。

Result: GRAM-R$^2$通过实验验证在响应排序、任务适应和基于人类反馈的强化学习中表现优越，优于现有多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GRAM-R$^2$展示出作为奖励推理基础模型的潜力，可应用于多种任务且需求最小或无需额外的微调。

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型潜在滥用带来的问题，并提高文本检测系统可信度。

Method: 提出MoSEs框架，包括三个核心组件：风格参考库（SRR）、风格感知路由器（SAR）和条件阈值估计器（CTE），动态确定检测阈值。

Result: MoSEs比基线平均提高了11.34%的检测性能，特别是在低资源场景下表现出39.15%的显著改进。

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过更精确的阈值动态调整，有效提高了AI生成文本检测的性能和可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Motivation: 低资源语言的语义评估缺乏高质量的基准数据集，为了解决这一问题，作者开发了一个专门用于Indic语言的高质量数据集。

Method: 作者创建了L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID数据集，包含10种低资源Indic语言（如马拉地语、印地语、泰米尔语等），每种语言含有20,000篇新闻及4种不同语义的标题版本，并通过余弦相似度评估多种多语言及语言特定模型的性能。

Conclusion: L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID数据集对低资源Indic语言的语义理解和多任务评估提供了重要资源，同时促进了基于相似性模型的NLP应用与研究。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

Result: 验证了 Pucci 方法与当前人工智能结果的一致性，显现了其方法的可行性，并将其扩展至多语言翻译中，效果良好。

Conclusion: Pucci 的方法满足了现代翻译需求，具有历史意义，并展示了其作为机器翻译先驱之一的价值，值得研究与推广。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的截断采样技术在模型信心度的利用上存在不足，影响生成文本的多样性与一致性。

Method: 通过建立熵约束最小化差异问题并转化为熵约束质量最大化问题（ECMM），提出一种高效贪心算法top-H解码。

Result: 在创意写作基准上，top-H比min-p采样性能提升最多达25.63%，同时在问答任务上表现稳定。

Conclusion: top-H推动了开放式文本生成领域的技术进步，兼具创造性与逻辑一致性，可应用于创意写作场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种模型在印地语-英语混合代码文本的命名实体识别任务中的表现，包括专门针对混合代码预训练的模型和大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在印地语-英语混合代码文本中进行NER任务的最佳模型选择，尤其是在面对语言切换和非正式结构时。

Method: 对比研究包括专门为混合代码预训练的模型（如HingBERT等）、非混合代码的多语言模型，以及在无监督条件下的生成式大型语言模型（Google Gemini）。使用Precision、Recall和F1 Score在基准数据集上评估性能。

Result: 混合代码模型（尤其是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT相关模型）表现优异，优于多语言模型和Google Gemini等封闭模型。而Google Gemini在零样本场景下表现竞争力突显大模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 专门针对混合代码的预训练模型由于领域特异性，在NER任务中具有竞争优势，而通用大模型仍然展示了一定潜力。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

### [347] [Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522)
*Jiaming Li,Longze Chen,Ze Gong,Yukun Chen,Lu Wang,Wanwei He,Run Luo,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PACS的强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）框架，用于解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中的挑战并取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法在优化中经常面临稀疏奖励信号和不稳定的策略梯度更新，作者希望开发一种更稳定高效的训练方法来提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: PACS通过将结果奖励视为可预测的标签，将RLVR问题重新表述为基于策略模型参数化的分数函数的监督学习任务，并通过交叉熵损失进行优化，实现了隐式单元（Actor）和评论员（Critic）的耦合，用于更稳定高效的训练。

Result: 在数学推理任务基准上，PACS优于现有的强大RLVR基线（如PPO和GRPO），在AIME 2025的pass@256上达到59.78%，相较PPO和GRPO分别提升了13.32和14.36个百分点。

Conclusion: PACS作为一种简单而强大的框架，为基于可验证奖励的大型语言模型后期训练提供了一个有希望的方向，具有显著的实用价值及性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出Moonshine系列小型自动语音识别模型，专注于支持不足的语言，且比同等规模或更大的现有模型性能更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型单语ASR模型在支持不足语言上的优势，挑战多语ASR模型更佳的常见假设。

Method: 用27M参数的小型单语模型，结合高质量人工标注、伪标注和合成数据的训练方法进行开发和验证。

Result: 相较同规模的Whisper Tiny模型，其平均错误率降低48%，并且部分超过Whisper Small和Whisper Medium模型。

Conclusion: 小型单语模型在支持不足语言的语音识别中表现突出，适合推动设备端的高效部署，并公开开源阿语、汉语等六种语言的模型。

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARLING通过强化学习优化响应质量和语义多样性以改善大语言模型在创意任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练过程通常关注准确和有用性，忽略了多样性，这限制了大语言模型在创意和探索性任务中的适用性。

Method: 提出了DARLING框架，其核心是通过学习的分区函数衡量文章语义多样性，并将其信号与质量奖励结合，在在线强化学习中提升模型输出的质量和新颖性。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上的实验表明，DARLING在非验证性任务（如指令执行、创意写作）和验证性任务（如数学解题）上都有较好的性能表现。

Conclusion: 优化多样性不仅能提升语言模型输出的质量，还提高了在线强化学习的探索能力，为创意任务提供更高效的支持。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

### [350] [PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02550)
*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了PalmX 2025任务，以评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域的文化能力。本次任务含有两部分选择题，探讨24个阿拉伯国家文化和宗教知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs在处理低资源语言和文化时存在偏差，尤其对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解较弱，亟需解决此问题。

Method: 提出了包含两项子任务的PalmX 2025竞赛，所有题目为现代标准阿拉伯语的多选题，涵盖文化和宗教领域，通过基准测试文化能力。

Result: 任务产生了有效的参与提交：任务一9组，任务二6组。任务微调可以显著提升性能，最高准确率达到了72.15%和84.22%。此外，参数高效微调方法最为显著，数据增强的效果依赖领域。

Conclusion: 通过PalmX 2025任务，证明了参数高效微调方法的优异性能，同时展示了提升LLMs在低资源文化领域表现的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过少样本学习和归纳推理任务，更好地从有限例子中推导规则并应用于新情况。

Method: 对比LLM的假设搜索框架与直接程序生成方法，通过分析其在少样本规则归纳任务中的表现评估效果。

Result: 假设搜索框架的表现接近人类，而直接程序生成方法明显落后，同时分析中揭示了假设生成的关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: LLM的假设搜索在建模归纳推理方面具有潜力，同时也需克服程序归纳方法中的效率挑战。

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统比较了四种代表性模型（YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM和SSDM）在语言流利性检测中的性能、可控性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前尽管在基准数据集上的表现有所提高，但在临床应用中，模型需要具备可控性和可解释性，而不仅仅是准确性。

Method: 对YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM和SSDM模型进行了系统比较，评估了它们的性能、可控性及可解释性，并结合多个数据集和临床专家的评估。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet在效率和简单性上表现出色，但透明度有限；UDM在准确性和临床可解释性之间取得最佳平衡；SSDM具有潜力，但实验中未完全复现。

Conclusion: 从比较中揭示了不同研究方法之间的权衡，并指出了未来适于临床应用的语言流利性检测模型的研究方向，同时提供了各方法的实现细节和实际部署建议。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试中数据污染可能导致模型表现仅为记忆力而非真正推理能力。

Method: 利用来自arXiv的论文数据，构建一个可以无限扩展的问答合成框架，通过分析知识截止日期前后的模型表现来评估潜在污染情况。

Result: 研究显示，不同开发者和规模的模型在知识截止日期前后均未出现明显性能衰减。

Conclusion: 多步推理的评估框架能减轻基准污染，并为未来的基准测试强调推理驱动的合成提供了方向。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

TL;DR: 通过提出的计算框架，人类与人工智能系统可通过社会学习整合语言指导和直接经验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在人类及人工智能中结合语言指导与直接经验，以使新环境中的学习更快更安全。

Method: 开发了一个将预训练语言模型转化为概率模型的计算框架，其可以模拟人类根据信念传递建议的方式，并利用行为实验和视频游戏模拟探索社会学习的影响。

Result: 实验表明语言指导可减少风险交互，加速关键发现，促进人类与模型之间的知识传递与协同学习。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了结构化、与语言兼容的表示形式如何实现人机协作学习以及知识在代际之间的积累。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过熵引导的轻量化测试时修正方法，性能接近推理模型，但成本低约三分之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型往往具有更高的性能，但代价和延迟较高，亟需找到成本和性能的折中方案。

Method: 使用基于熵的触发机制，检测模型在不确定性高的部分进行一次性、定向修正，借助小型不确定性报告指导更正。

Result: 小模型在部分任务中接近推理模型性能，以约三分之一成本达到参考推理模型质量的95%，提高了16个百分点精度。

Conclusion: 提出的熵感知修正方法能在成本和质量之间达到平衡，特别适合实际生产环境应用。

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了情绪识别精准度对社会行为和情绪行为的影响，发现较低精准度的情绪分类器会导致信任度降低和社会组织混乱，高精准度情绪分类器则增强情绪韧性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 要了解情绪识别精准度对社会行为的影响，特别是面对情绪误判所引发的组织性变化。

Method: 使用不同准确度的情绪分类器模拟主体行为，并通过2D格子模型观察主体在受认知情绪影响下的空间动态行为。

Result: 低精准度的情绪分类器导致信任和情绪整合衰退，而高精准度分类器有助于形成稳固的情绪群体并抵抗外部情绪冲击。

Conclusion: 情绪识别的偏差或不准可能显著扭曲社会进程，破坏情绪整合，应注意提高分类器的情绪感知能力。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改进人工智能模型在关键决策中的对齐能力，研究一种开放和可复现的方法，而非依赖于闭源服务。

Method: 提出利用本地开源集成辩论模型的方式，通过150场辩论的实验，分析集成模型的表现，并与单一模型进行对比。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human

### [358] [MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100)
*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MODE的轻量级检索生成方法，适用于小规模且特定领域的文档集，避免了复杂的大型向量数据库和重新排序的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索生成方法（如RAG）依赖于大型向量数据库和针对大规模语料调优的交叉编码器，对于小规模、特定领域的集合来说过于复杂。

Method: 利用聚类和路由检索替代传统的细粒度最近邻搜索。通过嵌入文档并将其分组到语义一致的聚类中，每个聚类用缓存的质心进行表示。在查询时仅根据相关质心内的聚类进行检索，减少复杂性和延迟。

Result: 在HotpotQA和SQuAD等语料库上（100-500个文档块），MODE的答案质量与密集检索基线相当或更优，同时显著减少了检索时间。此外，实验表明聚类的粒度和多聚类路由会影响召回率和精度之间的平衡，而更紧密的聚类能提升下游任务的准确性。

Conclusion: MODE为小型和中型语料库提供了一种简单、高效且主题聚焦的实用方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI正逐步进入高风险领域，但目前评价体系过于侧重技术指标，缺乏全面的多维度衡量方式。

Method: 提出Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM)算法，该算法统一多种异构指标，使用指数加权移动平均阈值和马氏距离进行联合异常检测。

Result: AMDM在模拟实验中将异常检测延迟从12.3秒减少到5.6秒，降低假阳性率从4.5%到0.9%。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，AMDM显著提高了指标评价的效率和准确性，推动了Agentic AI评价的全面性和实用性。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Method: 提出DACE算法，基于语言模型的自信度与任务难度/解决方案质量的关联性，动态平衡探索与利用之间的权衡。算法通过在线评估任务难度，自适应地调整内在奖励机制，针对困难任务降低高自信度，促进探索；针对简单任务奖励高自信度，提高效率。

Result: 在数学推理挑战（AIME, MATH）基准测试中，DACE方法显著优于现有强基线的表现。训练模型在测试时不仅精度提升，还在扩展测试计算能力时表现更加鲁棒。

Conclusion: DACE实现了有效的探索机制，同时保持了推理过程中精度，为强化学习中动态权衡探索与利用开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于优化埃塞俄比亚卫生资源规划的工具HARP，通过优化框架解决预算约束下的卫生覆盖问题，并提出两种算法以提高规划效率。


<details>

Motivation: 埃塞俄比亚卫生资源有限，不能一次性实现所有卫生体系的强化，需要一个优化框架来指导优先事项的规划。

Method: 开发了HARP工具，基于一个决策支持优化框架，提出单步学习增强方法和多步规划贪心算法，目标是最大化人口覆盖并满足区域比例目标。

Result: 在与埃塞俄比亚公共卫生研究所及卫生部的合作中，工具在三个地区及多种规划场景下展示了有效性。

Conclusion: HARP和提出的算法为埃塞俄比亚卫生资源优化提供了一种有效的方法，能够在预算不确定性下实现更好的设施规划和覆盖。

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Motivation: 传统的证据逻辑通常针对个体进行研究，但实际应用中团体知识与信念更有价值，因此需要扩展个体证据逻辑至团体。

Method: 通过扩展证据逻辑的拓扑语义，结合动态证据共享操作符，构造适用于团体知识与信念的逻辑系统，并进行系统的公理化和可判定性验证。

Result: 完全公理化了团体证据、团体知识和团体信念的逻辑系统；扩展了动态证据共享操作符，使动态逻辑与静态逻辑具有相同的表达能力。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种系统化的团体证据逻辑框架，为多智能体系统中的团体知识研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Motivation: 为了在自主代理使用LLM中解决固定工作流缺乏弹性及反应性工作流不能提取可转移推理结构的问题。

Method: 提出Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA)框架，利用语义-拓扑演化(STEV)算法，通过多臂赌博算法和环境反馈进行语义和拓扑结构的协同优化。

Result: 在对话、编码、长上下文问答、数学和自治代理任务中显示任务准确性提高了5-10%，并提高了资源效率。

Conclusion: HiVA框架证实在自主任务执行中有效性，解决了现有方法的局限，并提升了任务性能与资源利用。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

TL;DR: ILWS采用指令层权重塑形实现模型动态更新；显著提升企业支持场景下的效率，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型知识难以动态更新的问题，同时避免RAG的延迟和微调的高成本。

Method: 提出Instruction-Level Weight Shaping，通过反思引擎分析会话记录，调整指令、用户偏好和工具，以非侵入方式优化模型知识。

Result: 企业支持场景中提高2.4-5.0倍效率，幻觉减少80%。在Adobe Commerce Cloud的概念验证中工单处理效率提升4-5倍，单工单处理时长降低约80%。

Conclusion: ILWS适合动态领域的实际需求，尤其在需要自适应推理和低延迟部署的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs缺乏结构化推理能力，尤其是在需要领域特定最佳实践的复杂任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了SHERPA框架，通过将领域特定的最佳实践整合到分层状态机结构中，实现对LLM行为的细粒度控制，并且支持机器学习方法的决策。

Result: SHERPA在代码生成、类名生成和问答任务中的性能优于基线方法，尤其在具有确定最佳实践但训练数据不足的复杂任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SHERPA框架通过结构化的状态机设计有效改进了LLM在复杂任务中的输出质量，为其他任务场景提供了借鉴意义。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

Motivation: 整合城市中多模态数据以识别和理解重要事件，如紧急事件、自然灾害等，但在融合多数据源方面存在碎片化和依赖人工推理的难题。

Method: 开发 SIGMUS 系统，使用大语言模型生成世界知识，将来自不同数据源的信息与城市事件相关联，构建事件知识图谱。

Result: SIGMUS 能有效地将 5 种数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通数据）与相关城市事件在时间和地点上关联。

Conclusion: 系统通过知识图谱整合和语义分析，将多模态数据高效组织化，为分析城市事件提供了新方向，同时减少了对人工规则的依赖。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Motivation: 探讨在多模态网络数据处理中，基于自主决策和任务分解的代理系统能在新闻写作等复杂任务中能达到何种程度的表现。

Method: 提出了NEWSAGENT基准，包含6000个人工验证的真实新闻案例，通过转化多模态内容为文本，并让代理通过核心新闻职能生成完整文章；同时评估了开源与闭源模型在该基准上的表现。

Result: 代理在信息检索方面表现良好，但在规划和叙事整合上的表现较差。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为测试和优化代理在多模态数据处理及真实生产力应用中的能力提供了一个现实世界的测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

lightweight multi-agent system that automates the data analysis workflow, from

communication. Our approach combines a hybrid multi-agent architecture with
deterministic components, strategically externalizing critical logic from LLMs
to improve transparency and reliability. The system delivers granular, modular
outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration,
supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4
diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and
computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.

Motivation: 提高冰淇淋结构稳定性和抗融化性能，以满足消费者需求并提升产品质量。

Method: 在自制冰淇淋中加入四种不同的稳定剂（角豆胶、瓜尔胶、麦芽糊精、卡拉胶），通过定时拍摄及Python与OpenCV分析其在受控环境下的融化表现。

Result: 所有样品在融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，复冻后样品显示出更高的结构坚韧性，不同稳定剂在抗融化效果和结构支持上存在差异。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，提供了性能与经济性平衡的配方改进建议，可应用于小规模和商业化生产。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual

Motivation: AI系统通常难以自动构建并推理隐性的社会语境，需要改进以更好理解和应用于社交交互中。

Method: 设计了一种基于POMDP的S3AP结构化表示形式，通过状态、观察、行动和心理状态等元组来描述社会交互，可从自由形式叙述中自动生成，并用此来提升社会推理能力。

Result: 在五种社交推理任务中显著提升LLMs表现，例如在FANToM的理论推理任务中性能提升51%，并在SOTOPIA基准中社交动态预测和决策能力提高18%。

Conclusion: S3AP是一种强大且通用的结构表示方法，能显著增强AI系统的社交感知和互动能力，为开发更具社会意识的系统提供了可能性。

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了BALM-TSF，通过平衡时间序列和文本模态的对齐，改进了时间序列预测的性能，并在多个基准测试上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多模态架构在时间序列预测中，由于文本数据和时间序列数据差异大，导致某一模态被过度强调而信息丢失的问题。

Method: 提出BALM-TSF框架，利用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列数据，结合可学习的提示将时间序列的描述性统计数据输入LLM生成文本嵌入，并通过缩放策略及对比目标在两模态嵌入间实现平衡对齐。最后将对齐后的嵌入整合用于预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，使用了最少的可训练参数，BALM-TSF在长期和少样本预测中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BALM-TSF有效利用了文本和时间序列的互补信息，证明了其在提升多模态时间序列预测中的能力，并具有代码可重复性支持。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is

*Jaber Daneshamooz,Eugene Vuong,Laasya Koduru,Sanjay Chandrasekaran,Arpit Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NetGent是一个AI代理框架，通过自然语言规则定义复杂应用工作流程，用于生成真实的网络流量数据集，以支持网络领域的ML模型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有浏览器自动化工具难以在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率之间权衡。开发通用的网络ML模型需要来源于真实网络应用的多样化流量数据。

Method: 用户通过自然语言规则定义工作流程，这些规则被编译为非确定性有限自动机(NFAs)。状态综合组件将其转换为可执行代码，实现可确定性执行和高效数据生成。

Result: NetGent成功支持50多种工作流程自动化，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网页爬取，生成多样化、真实的流量数据，并能应对用户界面的变化。

Conclusion: NetGent结合语言代理的灵活性与编译执行的可靠性，为网络领域通用的ML数据集生成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化多代理框架，分两个阶段完成法律推理：知识获取和知识应用。评估显示，这种方法在法律推理中显著提高了准确性和透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律推理需要精确解读法规和一致性应用复杂规则，这给AI带来了重大挑战。

Method: 设计了一个模块化的多代理框架。第一阶段提取法律概念与规定，形成可验证的中间表示。第二阶段通过查询分析、逻辑推理和知识应用，完成案例的实际推理。

Result: 在法定税收计算任务上的评估中，新框架的基础模型取得了76.4%的准确率，相比基线性能18.8%有显著提升。

Conclusion: 模块化架构及形式化知识表征方法能提升法律推理中的一致性、可解释性和效率，为AI在法律领域的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出OmniDPO框架，旨在解决全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）中的幻觉问题，并提高模型在多模态上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OLLMs在任务处理上取得了成果，但存在幻觉问题，模型过于依赖文本信息，忽视了视听模态间的内在关联，尤其是在全模态场景中存在较大挑战。

Method: 提出OmniDPO框架，通过创建文本偏好样本和多模态偏好样本两种策略，增强模型对视听交互和多模态信息的理解和注意。

Result: 实验结果显示OmniDPO有效减轻了多模态幻觉，同时显著提升了多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO在解决全模态幻觉问题和提升OLLMs多模态推理能力方面取得显著进展，未来代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种将任务特定信息系统性嵌入大型语言模型输入中的方法，增强其解决图问题的能力，无需微调并超越传统复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在无需微调的情况下如何通过结构化的上下文注入来提高图相关任务的表现，解决现有方法效率低及成本高的问题。

Method: 提出一种结构化上下文注入的框架，将任务相关信息直接嵌入到输入中，无需对LLMs进行微调，且避免了多步查询的复杂性和费用。

Result: 实验表明，在多个图任务上，该方法能在精度与计算成本之间取得较优的平衡，并显著提高表现。

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是一种有效且可扩展的策略，可用于增强LLMs在图问题上的理解能力，其效果可与或超越更复杂的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

TL;DR: L-MARS通过分解询问、针对性搜索以及验证，减少法律问答中的幻觉和不确定性，提升准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能在高风险法律领域中提供准确、可信问答的系统，解决现有方法幻觉和不确定性的问题。

Method: 引入一种多代理系统L-MARS，通过分解问题、跨异构资源搜索、法官代理验证等递归策略实现高质量法律问答。

Result: L-MARS在新的法律问答基准上表现优异，提升了事实准确性，减少了不确定性，并获得了专家和LLM法官的更高偏好评分。

Conclusion: 多代理系统结合智能搜索的方式为在高风险领域部署LLM提供了可扩展和可复制的路径。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Motivation: 现有材料发现方法中，训练策略通常仅基于二值正确性或学习的偏好信号，但未能充分反映物理可接受性，因此需要更合理的训练技术。

Method: 提出了物理感知拒绝采样（PaRS）方案，在训练阶段选择基于基本物理一致性和数值接近目标的推理轨迹，并通过控制计算成本提升效率；通过教师模型生成推理轨迹，训练精细调整后的学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，所提出方法提高了模型的预测准确性和校准性，减少了物理违例率，降低了采样开销，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 将适度的领域约束与推理轨迹选择相结合，为开发可靠且高效的推理模型提供了一条切实可行的路径，可用于过程感知的属性预测和材料闭环设计。

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

TL;DR: 本文研究在无限时域马尔可夫决策过程中优化夏普比率的问题，提出了一种动态规划算法，并通过迭代数值验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决夏普比率在MDPs中的优化难题，尤其是动态规划无法直接应用于分数目标和风险指标的问题。

Method: 采用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率转化为均方差目标，并设计了一种迭代算法来解决此问题，同时开发了一种政策迭代过程以实现收敛。

Result: 提出的算法能单调提升并收敛于最优夏普比率，验证其有效性通过数值实验进行完成。

Conclusion: 首次基于动态规划算法解决了MDPs中夏普比率优化问题，并为解决其他分数目标的MDPs提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来深度学习模型广泛用于后缀预测，但因未显式结合领域知识，常无法满足基本的逻辑约束。

Method: 通过引入一种基于有限轨迹线性时序逻辑（LTLf）的可微逻辑损失函数，并利用Gumbel-Softmax技巧，将其集成到自回归序列预测器的训练过程中，与标准预测损失结合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三个真实世界数据集上提升了预测准确性和时间约束的一致性。同时，提出了两种逻辑损失变体（局部与全局），在噪声和现实场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于商业流程管理，也适用于任何符号序列生成任务，推动了神经-符号AI的发展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出ChatCLIDS基准，用以评估大语言模型（LLM）在健康行为改变中的说服对话能力，通过虚拟患者库和多回合交互模拟提供多维评估。结果显示LLMs在应对抗拒方面表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有闭环胰岛素输送系统的低采纳率主要受到行为、心理及社会等多种障碍的影响。需要一种评估框架支持针对健康行为改变进行的说服能力研究，以推进相应技术发展。

Method: 构建了一个名为ChatCLIDS的基准，包含专家验证的虚拟患者库——它们具有异质性强的临床特性和现实采纳障碍，模拟护士代理使用多种循证说服策略的多回合交互，并包括纵向咨询及对抗性社交影响场景评估。

Result: 结果发现，尽管更大规模且具有反思能力的LLMs可以逐渐调整策略，但在面对现实社交压力下的抗拒时，所有模型仍表现不足。

Conclusion: LLMs当前在行为改变领域存在关键限制，ChatCLIDS为构建可信赖的说服性人工智能提供了一种高保真、可扩展的测试平台，助力更广泛的健康和其他场景应用。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络与MCCFR的结合因游戏规模的增加而面临不同的挑战，如目标分布偏移、动作支持坍塌等。其目标是提出一个可以针对小型和大型游戏有效解决这些问题的方法。

Method: 开发了鲁棒的深度MCCFR框架，包含目标网络的延迟更新、混合均匀探索、方差感知训练目标和全面诊断监控，通过系统实验和消融研究验证其效果。

Result: 在Kuhn Poker和Leduc Poker实验中，鲁棒框架相较经典框架分别改善了60%和23.5%的可利用性，验证了框架的有效性和针对不同游戏规模的调整重要性。

Conclusion: 通过提供理论风险分析、自适应缓解框架、多尺度实验和部署指南，该研究在扩展MCCFR在大型游戏中的应用方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和基准测试缺乏多维度、系统化的分析和训练控制工具，导致难以有效评估和提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: 通过SATQuest生成基于可满足性问题的多样化逻辑推理任务，利用随机化的SAT问题生成以及PySAT进行答案验证，从而实现精细化分析和强化学习训练功能。

Result: 评估发现LLMs在超出熟悉数学格式的推广能力方面存在显著局限性，但通过引入SATQuest的奖励强化训练，模型在目标任务表现和复杂实例推广方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: SATQuest可以成为促进LLMs逻辑推理进步的基础工具，但仍需解决跨格式适应的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Result: 在逻辑解释生成方面效果显著，但人类学习实验显示，复杂的解释未能提升用户对简单问题的学习表现。

Conclusion: LENS奠定了建立支持人类学习的USML系统的基础，但需要进一步优化解释复杂性与用户接受度间的平衡。

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning

TL;DR: 引入了CoreThink，一种基于General Symbolics的新型推理层，该方法无需微调即可在多个基准测试中达到SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理范式存在性能瓶颈，本论文旨在开发新推理技术以突破现有瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种新推理方法General Symbolics，应用于工具调用、代码生成和规划领域，结合了无需微调训练的性能提升策略。

Result: CoreThink在多个基准测试中实现了SOTA表现，包括Livecodebench、ARC-AGI-2和SWE-Bench Lite等。

Conclusion: 通过General Symbolics方法，CoreThink显著提升了推理任务性能，并提供了一种无需微调即可提升精度的推理层。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReaL-TG框架，通过增强大语言模型(LLMs)的推理能力，用于现实世界的时间图中的可解释链接预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间图神经网络缺乏可解释性，且在应用于新图时需要重新训练。虽然已有工作尝试用LLMs进行图推理，但大多限于静态图或小型合成图，且缺乏对模型推理路径质量的评估。

Method: ReaL-TG是一种基于强化学习的框架，通过奖励机制引导模型探索图结构中的推理策略，并生成能够直接解释预测结果的推理路径。同时提出新的评估协议，结合排名指标与LLM评审系统评估推理质量与幻觉影响。

Result: ReaL-TG-4B经过调整可在人类评价和LLM评估下，显著优于更大的语言模型如GPT-5 mini，在排名指标上也表现突出，同时提供高质量解释。

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架在时间图的可解释链接预测上展示了优越性能，证明了通过强化学习优化LLMs 推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在因果推理等高级任务中存在局限，研究基于多智能体系统的因果推理模型可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 对支持因果推理的多智能体LLMs设计、架构模式、交互协议及评估方法展开详细分析，包括因果推理、反事实分析、因果发现和因果效应估计。

Conclusion: 该领域正在迅速发展，仍存在许多挑战和研究机遇，对未来研究提出了指导方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Method: 分析了代理推测（agentic speculation）的特点，如规模、异质性、冗余性和可操作性，并据此提出适应新需求的研究机会和架构元素。

Result: 提出了一种面向代理优先的数据系统架构理念，涵盖新的查询接口、处理技术和存储系统。

Conclusion: 当前的数据系统必须演变以高效支持以LLM代理为中心的新型工作负载，从而推动相关领域的进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Conclusion: 通过引入开放计算模型，展示了自然智能的某些基本特性，特别是在生化节律控制和尖峰波形成中的潜在机制。

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

Motivation: 现有游戏基准测试缺乏多样性，并很少评估代理完成整个故事情节的能力，需要一个能够评估复杂叙事互动的综合环境。

Method: 提出一个新的FlashAdventure基准测试，包含34个基于Flash的冒险游戏，并开发CUA-as-a-Judge自动评估系统，同时设计COAST框架，通过长期线索记忆改进计划和执行能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有GUI代理在完成完整故事任务方面存在困难，而COAST框架通过弥合观察-行为差距提高了里程碑完成率，但代理性能与人类仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究验证了通过改进代理设计和测试基准可以提高其性能，同时进一步研究仍然必要，以缩小代理与人类在复杂任务完成能力上的差距。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

Motivation: 现有多回合工具交互强化学习方法缺乏通用性和扩展性，限制了算法创新和社区应用。

Method: 提出VerlTool，以模块化设计实现标准化APIs支持多模态工具管理，异步执行显著提升速度，并提供跨域通用性框架。

Result: VerlTool在数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成等6个领域上表现与特定系统媲美，并提供统一训练基础设施。

Conclusion: VerlTool通过模块化架构和轻量化开发设计，降低研究成本，增强了强化学习对工具使用的扩展性与实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

Conclusion: Robix 实现了先进的机器人多模态推理和自然交互能力，展现出其在多样任务中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819

the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing

Motivation: 在电子商务中，不同商品列表是否指向同一SKU的问题长期存在，特别是在缺乏明确标识符的场景下。传统的规则或关键词方法难以准确鉴别复杂商品特性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Q2K的框架，包括三个主要组件：（1）推理代理生成问题以消除歧义，（2）知识代理通过网络搜索解决问题，（3）去重代理减少冗余并提供一致性。此外，人类参与进一步调整不确定的案例。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Q2K在准确性和鲁棒性上超越了传统方法，尤其是在捆绑商品和品牌区分等困难场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Q2K通过重复使用推理轨迹，以提供可扩展和解释性强的SKU映射解决方案，实现了准确性与效率之间的平衡。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Conclusion: 通过引入多智能体协作和动态策略，AnchorRAG提高了知识检索的鲁棒性和效率，为开放世界的问答任务提供了一种更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作系统的调度器在核政策理解应用程序需求方面存在语义差距，导致性能欠佳。

Method: 提出SchedCP框架，将语义推理与系统执行分离。通过Model Context Protocol服务器提供工作负载分析、调度策略存储和动态执行验证等核心服务。

Result: SchedCP实现了高达1.79倍的性能提升和13倍的成本降低，同时保证了高成功率。

Conclusion: SchedCP通过消除语义差距，促进了系统优化的普及，为创建自优化、了解应用需求的操作系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

Motivation: 传统文本到视频生成模型计算成本高，限制了其应用范围。本研究旨在通过改进视频制作流程，降低成本并提高效率。

Method: VGTeam是一套包含多个交流代理的系统，每个代理负责视频生成的不同环节，如脚本编写、场景创建和音频设计。这些代理通过一个对话塔式的工作流协同操作，将用户提供的文本提示转化为幻灯片叙事式视频。

Result: 系统在成功率98.4%的前提下，以平均仅$0.103的成本生成视频，同时保持高度的创作忠实度与定制化能力。

Conclusion: VGTeam系统不仅降低了视频生成的门槛，还展示了语言模型在创意领域的巨大潜力，为下一代内容创作开辟了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and

### [403] [GradeSQL: Outcome Reward Models for Ranking SQL Queries from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308)
*Mattia Tritto,Giuseppe Farano,Dario Di Palma,Gaetano Rossiello,Fedelucio Narducci,Dharmashankar Subramanian,Tommaso Di Noia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文讨论了利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行Text-to-SQL任务的进展与瓶颈，并提出使用Outcome Reward Models（ORMs）弥补生成复杂SQL查询中的问题，实验显示该方法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成正确SQL方面存在局限性，特别是在与用户意图和数据库模式精确对齐的复杂查询中难度较大，需要新的策略来提升其性能。

Method: 提出了通过Outcome Reward Models（ORMs）对SQL生成任务进行优化的方式，并构建和评估了适用于Text-to-SQL任务的ORM框架，对BIRD和SPIDER数据集进行了测试，比较了ORM与其他方法（如BoN和Maj）的表现。

Result: 实验表明ORM在BIRD和SPIDER基准测试中的执行准确率优于ex-BoN和Maj方法，分别提升了+4.33%和+2.10%（相较于ex-BoN），以及+2.91%和+0.93%（相较于Maj）。此外，在与SQL生成对齐的模型上微调（如OmniSQL）进一步提升了ORM的表现。

Conclusion: ORM方法在Text-to-SQL任务中表现优异，特别是在处理复杂查询及候选数量增加时能明显提升生成效果，是一种比现有策略更有效的方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

*Francesca Cairoli,Luca Bortolussi,Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh,Lars Lindemann,Nicola Paoletti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为GenQPM的新方法，用于解决现有量化预测监控方法在多模态动态系统中的保守和信息不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化预测监控方法在面对多模态动态系统时表现不佳，无法有效区分满足属性程度的不同模式，导致预测区间过于保守且缺乏信息。

Method: 提出GenQPM方法，利用基于深度生成模型的分数扩散模型精确逼近多模态系统动态，同时设计模式分类器对预测轨迹进行分模式分割，并对每种模式应用共形推断，生成统计有效的模式特定预测区间。

Result: 在代理导航和自动驾驶任务的基准测试中，GenQPM显著优于现有的模式无关方法，生成了更具信息性（更少保守）的预测区间。

Conclusion: GenQPM是应对多模态动态系统挑战的一种有效方法，在保持统计保证的同时提供了更精准的预测信息。

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

### [405] [Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01350)
*Yunqing Liu,Nan Zhang,Zhiming Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需额外训练的新型CAD零件检索框架，通过使用Error Notebooks与RAG的结合增强通用语言模型的检索性能，实验结果显示精确度显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂CAD设计验证和工程任务需要有效的零件检索，而现有的LLMs或VLMs在处理长输入序列和检索性能方面表现不佳，同时模型微调成本高或无法实现。

Method: 该方法利用Error Notebooks加RAG进行优化，其中Error Notebooks存储历史错误推理链(CoT)及其校正答案，通过检索相关记录改进推理；同时开发了一个以人为参与的CAD数据集评估其性能。

Result: 实验表明，利用GPT-4o和Gemini模型的检索性能显著提升，其中GPT-4o在满足人类偏好的数据集上提升了23.4%的绝对精确度，尤其在部件数量较多的复杂场景中优势明显。

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需训练即可提升复杂CAD模型零件检索性能，证明了Error Notebooks和CoT推理在复杂工程任务中的显著作用。

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为DeepResearch Arena的新基准，用于评估深度研究代理的能力，通过从200多场学术研讨会中提取研究任务构建了超过1万个高质量的研究任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何有效评价深度研究代理的能力，弥补当前缺乏能真正反映研究实际环境的基准性数据集的问题。

Method: 采用了一种多代理分层任务生成（MAHTG）系统，从研讨会记录中提取有研究价值的内容，并将其转化为高质量的科研任务，同时确保这些任务的可追溯性。

Result: DeepResearch Arena基准测试涵盖12个学科，总计收录超过10,000个高质量研究任务，并且评估表明当前最先进的研究代理在该基准下表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena成功创建了一个可用于更真实地评估深度研究代理能力的基准，并展示了现有系统的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Motivation: 由于AI能够大规模快速生成假设，因此存在促进科学发现的潜力，但传统的验证方式可能无法跟上假设生成的速度。

Method: 文章回顾了科学发现的历史发展，分析了AI如何重塑科学发现的传统方式，并探讨数据驱动方法、知识感知神经架构、符号推理框架及LLM的主要方法。

Result: 目前的AI系统虽然能够揭示模式并提出科学定律的候选，但其科学价值依赖于严谨透明的验证机制。

Conclusion: 可靠验证机制是AI辅助科学发现的基石，科学界需关注这些机制的发展以保证AI推动科学进步。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理系统的场景生成器方法，用于提升服务生态系统治理相关实验系统的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于社会环境的复杂性和服务生态系统多样性因素的变化，传统基于预定义规则的场景构建方法面临了信息有限、影响因素多、社会元素难以衡量等问题，迫切需要一种能有效生成高质量场景的新方法。

Method: 采用三类LLM支持的自适应代理（EA、SA、PA），分别生成社会环境、社会协作结构及任务解决方案，并通过PA实时调整实验方案，实现高效、准确的场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法能基于ProgrammableWeb数据集更高效、更精确地生成实验场景。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅开发了高质量的实验系统构建流程，还为服务生态系统治理提供了一种创新的技术手段。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CSR的训练目标，通过引入对抗性操作干预增强语言模型的推理可信度，同时定义了COS指标量化模型的推理真实性。实验显示在多种任务中CSR显著提升了模型的推理真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型尽管能给出正确答案，但推理过程常不可靠，特别是在高风险领域，这削弱了对模型的信任，因此需要改进模型的推理可信度。

Method: 设计了名为CSR的训练目标，通过加入自动化的对抗性干预（如改变加减运算符号）来增强模型推理过程与最终输出的关联性，并定义新的COS指标来评估模型对干预的敏感性。

Result: 在构造化推理任务（算术、逻辑推导、规划）中，CSR方法比标准微调和过程监督提升了最多70%的推理可靠性，同时只造成轻微的准确度损失。

Conclusion: CSR显著改善了语言模型推理的真实性和可信度，表现出较好的泛化能力，并且可以与推理时间方法协同工作，从而应用到更复杂的领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Method: 论文提出了一种结构化决策框架，通过引入启用代理（Enabler agents）、层级（Levels）和场景（Scenarios）的概念，将其应用于灾害管理场景中，并与基于判断的系统及有灾害经验的人工操作员进行比较和评估。

Conclusion: 论文展示了所提出的结构化决策框架在构建可靠的安全关键人工智能应用中的潜力，尤其是在灾害管理等场景中的表现优越。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种称为“Web Agent Throttling”的框架，通过要求AI网络代理解决推理难题来限制其资源访问，从而降低恶意或错误使用带来的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI网络代理的普及，其高速和复杂性给内容提供商带来了负担和风险，同时传统的防御手段不足以阻止其绕过认证。本文旨在设计一种机制，在提供资源访问前对这些代理施加成本限制以保护服务。

Method: 提出一种名为“Throttling Gates”的机制，要求代理通过能产生高计算负担的推理难题。并设计了一种基于Rebus的推理门和其生成及验证协议，以增强难题的有效性和伸缩性。

Result: 所提出的系统在计算消耗上实现了非对称性（响应生成成本是内容生成成本的9.2倍），并且在实际环境中成功验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效限制了AI网络代理的资源访问能力，但需要进一步研究以优化其实际部署中的局限性和环境影响。

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，一些用户通过“Jailbreak”等方式滥用这些模型带来安全威胁，因此需要更有效的防御方法。

Method: 研究提出了一种新颖的神经元层面解释性方法，通过将模型内部表示投射到更一致的词汇空间，再调整安全相关神经元的激活以控制模型行为，并提出了SafeTuning微调策略。

Result: 通过该方法，实现了平均超过97%的攻击成功率降低，并显著提升了模型对Jailbreak攻击的鲁棒性，优于现有所有四种基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 研究展示了调整安全相关神经元可有效对抗模型中的Jailbreak攻击，为模型安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数用户不会阅读在线服务的隐私政策，导致数据隐私实践缺乏透明度，妨碍了以用户为中心的网络方法以及数据共享和重用的实施。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLM）自动提取隐私政策中的关键信息，并根据数据隐私词汇（DPV）构建Pr^2Graph知识图谱。通过该方法分析前100个热门网站的隐私政策，并将成果公开为资源。另外，演示了如何利用Pr^2Graph构建正式的政策表示方式，例如ODRL和psDToU。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为审计网络和互联网服务的隐私实践提供了新方向，并通过公开数据集和源代码促进了此领域的进一步研究与改进。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

*Ruijia Li,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Jiatong Wang,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前研究探讨了AI模拟对话与人类教学对话之间的结构和行为差异，发现AI对话在认知引导和交互模式上存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察AI生成的教学对话是否能够与真实教学对话匹敌，并为提升教育对话系统提供指导。

Method: 采用Initiation-Response-Feedback（IRF）编码和Epistemic Network Analysis（ENA）方法对AI生成的对话与人类教学对话进行定量比较。

Result: 人类对话在话语长度、提问行为以及一般反馈行为方面显著优于AI生成对话。而AI生成对话表现出结构简单化和行为趋同性，缺乏多样性和认知引导。

Conclusion: 目前AI生成的教学对话系统在教育有效性方面存在重要限制，未来需设计更具教育意义的生成式对话模型。

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为动态推测规划（DSP）的框架，用于在不牺牲性能的情况下加速大语言模型的推理，并显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型尽管在复杂任务中表现出色，但由于高延迟和推理成本过高，在部署中面临挑战。当前方法难以平衡性能、训练需求和操作成本，同时缺乏用户控制选项。

Method: 提出了一种异步在线强化学习框架（DSP），通过优化端到端延迟和成本的联合目标，实现无损加速。用户可通过单一参数调节速度和成本之间的权衡，无需额外的离线训练准备。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准上的实验表明，DSP的效率与最快的无损加速方法相当，但总成本减少了30%，不必要的成本减少了高达60%。

Conclusion: DSP框架为大语言模型的部署提供了一种更高效且经济的解决方案，同时保持了性能的完整性，具备推广价值。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through
https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.

TL;DR: 研究引入了一种名为EigenBench的方法，通过对语言模型的输出进行集体评估，在没有真实标签的情况下对模型的价值观对齐程度进行量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能与人类价值观的对齐问题尚未解决，当前缺乏定量评估指标。

Method: 提出EigenBench方法：通过模型间相互评估，并采用EigenTrust算法汇总结果，生成衡量模型价值对齐的得分。

Result: 实验发现得分主要受提示词的影响，但模型本身也存在一定的价值倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench可用于衡量模型的价值对齐能力，且在无标准标签的情况下操作可行。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

TL;DR: 该研究针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗环境中的公平性问题，提出了两个基准数据集和一个多指标框架进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的公平性评估方法在医疗场景中表现不足，忽略了医疗伤害的多维特性，且可能导致模型生成过于保守但不准确的输出。

Method: 构建两个大规模基准数据集（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），同时提出一个多指标评价框架mFARM，用于评估分配、公平性稳定性以及潜在差距三个维度，并提出公平性-准确性平衡（FAB）分数。

Result: 通过实验发现，mFARM评估指标能够更有效地捕捉偏差。多数模型在量化后仍保持较高的mFARM分数，但在减少上下文输入时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法和数据集能够更好地评估医疗场景中模型的公平性问题，为开发对健康对齐的AI提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为“结构生成智能本体”的概念，认为真正的智能源于生成新结构、协调逻辑并维持身份的能力，目前的AI系统虽功能广泛，但缺乏这种深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能的本质，认为当前的AI虽然具有广泛的功能，但只是表面模拟，而非真正的智能。

Method: 提出了“生成性”、“协调性”和“维持性”这三个条件，作为真正智能的关键定义和评判标准。

Result: 当前AI虽功能广泛，但未达到三项条件定义的深度智能标准，仍是表面模拟。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要深度，而非广度。如果未来满足这种深度条件的系统得以实现，将不再仅是工具，而可能成为与人类并立的第二存在。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在法律领域的应用受到可靠性和透明度问题的限制，因此需要一种高效且可扩展的方法来增强其适用性。

Method: 提出了一种结构化提示方法，包括文档分块与扩充、工程化提示设计以及两种启发式策略（分布式定位和逆基数加权），结合使用QWEN-2模型对输入进行处理。

Result: 该方法在信息检索性能上超越了现有方法，提升了9%，并达到了技术最前沿的水准，但同时指出了现有评估指标的局限性。

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种具前景的工具，可提升AI在法律领域的可靠性与问责性，并为未来研究提供方向指导。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前预测方法在科学工具中的可信度仍需提高，特别是在提供有意义的科学解释方面。因此，研究目标是通过知识图谱生成具备科学意义的可解释路径，为科学发现提供支持。

Method: 作者提出了一种名为REx的算法，通过奖励和策略机制强化学习引导，在知识图谱中识别具有解释性的路径，并结合领域相关本体扩展这些路径以确保解释具备科学意义。

Result: REx方法在三个知识图谱基准案例中进行了药物再利用评估，展示了其生成基于生物医学知识的解释能力，并在预测性能上超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: REx为人工智能驱动的科学发现提供了一种有效的方法，在支持生物医学领域的知识验证和预测方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能在算法设计中超越简单函数调整，进行更广泛的创新。

Method: 通过让LLM构建解决约束性3D装箱问题的完整算法，采用约束框架和迭代自我修正，以提高生成代码的可靠性和有效性。

Result: 生成的启发式算法与人类设计的贪婪算法性能相当，但在约束条件加严时效果下降。结合人设计元启发式算法后，其性能与已建立的求解器相媲美。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动化启发式设计中面临主要障碍：其复杂推理任务中的脆弱性以及预训练偏差限制了其搜索新颖解的空间。

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像拥有丰富的光谱信息，但其高维性带来计算负担和冗余，因此需要有效的降维方法。

Method: 采用模型驱动的框架进行波段选择，并利用后续可解释性方法分析分类器对每个光谱波段的作用，基于波段对分类器决策的贡献计算影响分数，再选择高影响波段。

Result: 实验表明，仅选取30个波段的分类器能够匹配甚至超过全波段基线，同时显著减少计算需求。

Conclusion: 通过模型对齐和解释指导的波段选择是高光谱成像有效降维的合理途径。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为SWE-PRM的推理时过程奖励模型，用于在执行过程中检测和纠正大语言模型在多步骤软件工程任务中的轨迹错误，从而改善其效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂的软件工程任务中性能存在效率低下的问题，如重复探索、循环错误和无法终止。现有方法通常仅在任务失败后分析错误，缺乏实时纠正机制，因此需要构建能实时干预的模型以提高任务完成效率。

Method: 论文提出了一种过程奖励模型SWE-PRM，通过分析常见低效行为的分类法（taxonomy），在推理执行过程中提供轻量级且可解释的反馈，无需修改模型的基础策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench实验中，闭源的过程奖励模型将问题解决率从40%提高到50.6%，特别是在中等和难度较高的任务中表现尤为显著，同时还减少了轨迹长度。

Conclusion: SWE-PRM显著改善了大语言模型在软件工程任务中的效率和可靠性，其成本较低且具有实际可扩展性，是提高大语言模型表现的重要方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂多表生物医学数据环境中表现出流利但过于自信的输出问题。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理更适用于复杂的结构化数据环境。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Motivation: 旨在将大型语言模型（LLMs）从被动生成转变为可嵌入复杂环境的自主决策型智能体，填补现有LLM-RL单步马尔可夫过程（MDP）的局限性。

Method: 通过对比单步MDP与时间扩展、部分可观测的马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），提出两种分类体系，并整合500余篇相关研究文献与开源工具。

Conclusion: 强化学习是将规划、工具使用、记忆等能力转化为适应性和稳健行为的关键；未来应关注可扩展的通用AI系统的开发及其面临的挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Motivation: 现有的算子学习方法如深度算子网络和傅立叶神经算子等，虽然为传统数值求解器提供了替代方案，但在平衡算子与物理损失、处理噪声或稀疏数据以及提供不确定性量化方面存在瓶颈。

Method: 1. 通过进化多目标优化在Pareto前沿自适应平衡算子及物理损失。2. 使用副本交换随机梯度Langevin动力学提升参数空间的全局探索并加速收敛。3. 通过随机采样内置贝叶斯不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该架构提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过进化多目标优化和随机动力学提升学习网络性能，同时具备抗噪能力及不确定性量化。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Motivation: 精神障碍常因缺乏可见症状而误诊，紧急情况下快速识别精神问题至关重要。

Method: 通过从德国救援站收集紧急精神病患者数据，应用多种机器学习模型（如Llama 3.1）对行为数据进行预测分析。

Result: 模型表现出一定的预测能力，有助于高效识别精神健康障碍患者。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型和机器学习方法能在紧急情况下提供精神障碍诊断的辅助工具并提升效率。

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Motivation: 随着数据湖的广泛应用，为强大的机器学习模型训练提供了支持，但敏感医疗数据的潜在泄露风险也显著增加，促使研究者探索有效的隐私保护机制。

Method: 提出通过在模型导出时，采用逐层衰减学习率微调模型参数的方法，破坏嵌入数据的有效性，同时保持任务性能。

Result: 实验证明了该方法在医学数据集（DermaMNIST、ChestMNIST和MIMIC-CXR）上的有效性，能够同时维持任务性能并抵御最新的数据外泄攻击，显著优于以往的防御技术，并使外泄数据无法用于训练。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的技术是一种简单而高效的隐私保护解决方案，对防止数据湖训练模型中的数据泄露具有重要意义，同时亦为集中的联邦学习提供了安全保障及未来研究方向。

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Motivation: 研究意在探索新皮层在情节记忆能力上的潜力，以及其与语义记忆之间的关系，回应关于语义和情节记忆系统二分观点的挑战。

Method: 使用预测编码作为模型基础，验证新皮层能否通过稠密、重叠的表征实现对个体经历的有效回忆，分析训练样本数量对回忆能力的影响。

Result: 模型表现出有限的情节记忆能力，仅在少量样本情况下能准确记忆，但随着样本数增加，其回忆能力下降且无法泛化。

Conclusion: 情节记忆可能从语义学习中逐步产生，但新皮层表征的有限能力进一步强化了需要海马体稀疏、分隔表征的必要性。

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Motivation: 现有的低比特后训练量化方法因层级优化导致误差积累及性能下降，而量化感知训练虽优化全面但计算、时间与内存开销极高。

Method: 提出通过零阶优化的量化感知训练框架ZeroQAT，无需反向传播，减少计算和内存开销，同时优化量化权重、权重截断阈值及等效变换。

Result: ZeroQAT在实现后训练量化效率的同时保持了量化感知训练的高精度。

Conclusion: ZeroQAT是一种实用的方法，高效实现大语言模型的高质量低比特量化。

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Result: 通过使用提出的方法，大幅提高了5nm节点Vmin预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 利用转移学习和传感器数据可有效解决在先进技术节点中因工艺变化导致的Vmin预测挑战。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样迭代过程计算耗时，其现有加速方法存在局限性，需要改进效率和质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出了A-FloPS框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，实现高效采样路径设计，且不需重新训练。

Result: A-FloPS在低评估次数(NFE)下表现出色，能够生成高质量、清晰的图像，FID较低，速度与效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: A-FloPS被证明为通用且有效的高质量、低延迟生成建模解决方案，同时对原生流模型有所改进。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨一种新型的自适应物理信息神经网络（PINN）框架，通过多类别特征工程增强对粘土、页岩和煤炭中氢吸附预测的准确性。与传统方法相比，提升了预测精度，同时显著加速了计算速度。

Motivation: 当前氢储存、天然氢探索及放射性废物管理对预测地下氢吸附非常重要，而传统实验方法耗时、易出错且无法全面捕捉地质异质性，需探索高效、准确的预测方法。

Conclusion: 此框架通过准确的氢吸附预测和不确定性评估加速了站点筛选，有助于风险知情的决策制定，实现了快速、高效的地质建模能力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 深度学习技术能有效识别俄罗斯太空物体的异常活动，分析结果可为未来军事行动的轨道活动预警提供支持。

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

Motivation: 解决光网络中正常实例远多于故障实例的类别不平衡问题，提升故障检测及识别的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用实验数据集，直接比较预处理、处理中和后处理方法，分析其在故障检测和识别中的表现，如阈值调整、随机欠采样、SMOTE以及元学习与生成式AI等。

Result: 后处理方法在故障检测中提升F1分数（上升至15.3%）。随机欠采样提供最快推理；生成式AI在故障识别上改善性能（提升至24.2%）。SMOTE适用于有类别重叠和低延迟需求场景，而元学习适合非延迟限制场景。低重叠情境下生成式AI实现最佳性能和最低推理时间。

Conclusion: 无需延迟优先时，元学习方法表现突出；类别重叠情况下应选用SMOTE。低重叠且无延迟约束场景下，生成式AI是最佳选择。

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Motivation: 当前的多层感知机（MLP）虽然广泛应用于信号建模，但不能天然支持多层次细节，因此需要一个能够直接处理LoD表示的改进架构。

Method: 通过对MLP进行改良，提出T-MLP架构，附加多个输出分支（即尾部）至隐藏层，并设计新的损失公式和训练策略，使每个隐藏层在特定LoD上学习目标信号。

Result: T-MLP在不同信号表示任务中优于现有的神经LoD基线，验证了其多尺度建模能力。

Conclusion: T-MLP能够支持多层次细节信号表示，为高效建模和传输不同类型信号提供了新方法。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte

generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical

integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,

represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

Motivation: 为解决现代生成模型中因过拟合可能导致的训练数据泄漏以及数据表现过高的问题。

Method: 引入GenDataCarto框架，根据难度分数与记忆分数将数据分为四个象限，进行针对性的剪除和权重调整，同时通过理论分析证明高记忆数据点的降权可以降低泛化差距。

Conclusion: 通过数据干预可以显著减轻数据泄漏风险，同时对生成性能影响非常小，展示了数据管理在生成模型中的重要性。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 研究评估了使用FedProx算法的联邦学习方法预测学生表现，其性能接近于但稍逊于集中式模型，同时提供了强大的隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决教育数据使用中的隐私问题，并探索隐私保护型计算方法以满足巴西总数据保护法（LGPD）的要求。

Method: 采用FedProx算法在联邦学习框架下训练深度神经网络模型，并比较其与集中式eXtreme Gradient Boosting模型在预测学生表现方面的表现，涵盖200多万学生记录。

Result: 联邦学习模型取得了61.23%的准确率，与集中式模型的63.96%较为接近，但在隐私保护方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 联邦学习方法是一种在数据保护法规下构建协作预测模型的可行且有效的解决方案，在巴西教育领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种改进LSTM模型的输入重排序方法，探讨权重归一化及非线性化门控机制，以提高模型的长期信息捕获能力并验证其在文本分类任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LSTM在捕获长期信息方面存在不足，尤其是在聚焦特定历史信息以及权重归一化和门控机制的非线性处理上尚未实现最佳效果。

Method: 提出输入重排序方法，探索Lp范数选择以平滑或稀疏权重，并通过小型前馈神经网络（FFNN）对LSTM门控机制进行非线性化增强，与普通LSTM进行文本分类性能对比。

Result: 改进方法在文本分类任务中提升了LSTM模型的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过引入输入重排序、权重归一化和非线性化门控机制，可以显著提高LSTM模型捕捉长期信息的能力，优化模型性能。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了协作式集成对抗训练（CEAT），通过突出子模型间的协同学习来增强模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，并证明其在多个数据集上的表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的EAT方法忽略了子模型间的协作效益，而研究发现具有分类分歧的样本对集成模型的鲁棒性影响更大，因此需要一种新的方法来提升子模型协作。

Method: 提出CEAT方法，通过利用概率分歧自适应地为不同样本分配权重，结合校准距离正则化，强调子模型间协作学习，提升对抗攻击训练效果。

Result: 实验表明，CEAT在多种数据集上性能达到最先进水平，显著优于现有的EAT方法，并且具有良好的模型适配性。

Conclusion: CEAT方法能有效提升集成模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时具有模型无关性，为广泛的集成方法提供了灵活的适配能力。

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Motivation: 当前对生成模型进行真实性检测的研究多集中于图像和文本，而对常见的表格数据则较少涉及。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于datum-wise的transformer体系结构，并融入了表格自适应组件以提高精度。

Result: 在AUC和准确率方面分别提高了7个点，通过表格自适应进一步提升了7点的准确性，表现出较高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在真实场景下检测合成表格数据不仅可行，且具有很高的可靠性。

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在进行LLMs剪枝的同时保持其在谎言检测任务中的能力。

Method: 提出Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO)，通过关注激活异常值和具备辨别性的层以优化剪枝效果，同时引入提示规则改进TruthfulQA基准。

Result: 实验结果表明，TPLO方法在50%稀疏情况下实现了88%的谎言检测准确率，并提升了TruthfulQA上的性能。

Conclusion: TPLO方法在保留LLMs性能及其谎言检测能力方面表现优异，表明通过关注关键激活特征的剪枝策略的有效性。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

### [462] [Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00097)
*Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为PEGE的改进方法，可以提高神经网络量化模型的准确性，尤其是在低比特宽度下表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的量化感知训练方法使用了STE以解决离散化函数的不可微问题，但忽略了连续值和量子化值的离散化误差，在低比特宽度条件下，会导致精度下降。

Method: PEGE通过一种新的对数值课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，逐步用量化权重和激活值取代全精度值，并将量化感知训练描述为一个同时最小化任务预测损失和离散化误差的协同优化问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上进行的大量实验表明，PEGE显著优于现有的反向传播方法，使低精度模型可以达到甚至超过全精度模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的PEGE是一种统一且具有强泛化能力的框架，为低比特宽度神经网络的量化感知训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Conclusion: 通过融合经典AI与量子计算的计算范式，自动化工作流降低了准入门槛，为量子设备作为现实优化问题求解加速器提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的心电图模型表现优异，但其跨层表示尚未被充分理解和利用，需探索是否最终层表示对下游任务最优。

Method: 通过1D Vision Transformer的掩码建模预训练模型，并提出PMA架构，用门控网络选择性融合模型各层的表示。此外，将聚合方法扩展至预训练阶段。

Result: 通过灵活的层间表示聚合，模型在下游任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 依赖预训练模型最后一层表示并非最优，采用PMA架构充分利用跨层表示的多样性能够增强表征能力并提升性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化化学实验参数通常是黑箱搜索问题。作者希望探讨采用预训练语言模型是否能改进优化效率。

Method: 在六个实验数据集上，比较LLM引导的优化（LLM-GO）与贝叶斯优化（BO）及随机采样的表现，并使用信息理论框架分析采样多样性。

Result: LLM的优化表现显著超过BO，尤其是在复杂参数和稀有解的场景下。同时，LLM维护了更高的探索熵水平。

Conclusion: LLM-GO在需要领域知识的复杂参数优化中具有独特优势，并不完全替代传统优化，而是提供有效补充。

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Conclusion: FNODE作为一种新的建模框架，能够有效地克服多体系统建模中的挑战，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural

efficiency.

TL;DR: FlashTTS是一种服务系统，通过优化方法使得小型大语言模型（LLM）在内存受限的边缘设备上实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型需要较大的计算资源，而边缘设备由于内存限制只能运行小型模型，其推理能力显著受到限制。现有的推理扩展方法在边缘硬件上的开销过高，因此需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了FlashTTS系统，通过三个优化：(i) 推测性的光束扩展以缓解不规则推理路径导致的系统瓶颈；(ii) 不对称多模型内存分配动态平衡生成和验证阶段的内存；(iii) 动态前缀感知调度最大化KV缓存的重用。

Result: FlashTTS使得在单个消费级GPU（24GB）上运行的小型LLM可以达到和大型云模型匹配的推理准确性和延迟。此外，与vLLM基线相比，其平均提升了2.2倍的吞吐量并将延迟减少了38%-68%。

Conclusion: FlashTTS通过优化推理过程，为内存受限的边缘设备提供了高性能的推理能力，促进了高效能智能AI在边缘设备上的普及。

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

TL;DR: 提出TConstFormer，通过创新机制实现O(1)的KV Cache和摊销常量时间复杂度，改进Transformer在超长序列处理上的效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在超长序列处理时由于KV Cache线性增长和计算复杂度大的问题限制了其能力。

Method: 引入TConstFormer架构，采用周期性状态更新机制，实现真正的常量大小KV Cache和摊销的常量时间复杂度。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明，TConstFormer在速度、内存效率以及长文本推断任务性能上具有明显优势。

Conclusion: TConstFormer实现了高效且鲁棒的流式语言模型应用，为拓展此类模型的实用性提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

Motivation: 解决现有参数估计方法在处理非线性、跨物理场交互以及稀疏观测时的不足，提出新方法以提高估计精准度。

Method: 使用独立坐标神经网络对每个参数场在物理空间或状态变量中进行连续表示，进行稀疏数据驱动的参数场估计。

Conclusion: Neptune方法在工程、医疗保健及更广泛领域中，展现了可靠且数据高效的参数推断能力，具备潜在的广泛影响力。

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,

*Ruokai Yin,Sattwik Deb Mishra,Xuan Zuo,Hokchhay Tann,Preyas Shah,Apala Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了通过强化学习优化分布式LLM推理性能的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统无法在多样化硬件架构上有效协调分布式LLM推理的性能。

Method: 引入基于强化学习的策略来联合优化跨多个设备的并行度与操作的精细粒度分片参数。

Result: 在MoE模型上实现了相比传统方法3.5倍的吞吐量提升，以及较Megatron-LM方法1.06倍的提升。

Conclusion: 通过学习高效策略，该方法显著增强了复杂硬件架构下的分布式LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

TL;DR: 演讲和传感器数据包含时间和频率领域的信息，采用先进的语音基础模型可提升可穿戴传感器任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音表征能否在可穿戴传感器时间序列任务中实现高效信息编码与任务改进。

Method: 使用HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0等语音模型提取特征，并应用于多种时间序列任务，包括情绪分类、心律失常检测和活动分类。

Result: 语音模型提取的特征表现优于直接在传感器数据上训练的自监督模型，表现出对可穿戴传感器任务的强相关性。

Conclusion: 语音模型可以有效支持数据稀缺的时间序列任务，推动跨领域时间序列模型的发展。

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合量子优化的选择性状态空间模型（Q-SSM），通过量子参数电路提升长期时间序列预测的效率和稳健性，同时避免了传统模型的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前针对长期时间序列预测的传统方法存在计算复杂度过高、对初始化敏感以及在多变量预测中的稳健性不足等问题，亟需新的高效鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出了一种融合状态空间动态和变分量子门的混合量子优化方法Q-SSM，用于替代昂贵的注意力机制，通过简单的参数化量子电路实现自适应记忆更新。

Result: 在ETT、Traffic和Exchange Rate三个基准数据集上的实验结果显示，Q-SSM相较于LSTM、TCN、Reformer等基线模型，以及基于Transformer的模型和S-Mamba，能够取得更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 变分量子门机制在长期时间序列预测中显示出潜力，它能克服传统方法的局限性，为多变量预测提供高效、稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReLATE框架，一种基于强化学习的自动化稀疏张量表示方法，以解决高维稀疏数据分析中因张量不规则计算和存储访问带来的性能挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维稀疏数据的分析因其不规则计算和内存访问模式在现代并行处理器上表现不佳，现有方法基于专家设计的稀疏张量格式难以适应变形张量的形状及数据分布的可变性。

Method: 提出了ReLATE框架，通过一个自主智能体在无需标注训练样本的情况下与张量分解环境交互，采用混合无模型和基于模型的方法，通过真实和虚拟动作进行学习，结合规则驱动的动作屏蔽以及动力学感知的动作筛选机制。

Result: ReLATE能自动适应多样的张量形状和数据分布，与专家设计的格式相比，在不同稀疏张量数据集上实现一致的性能提升，并在最佳稀疏格式基础上得到最高2倍的加速效果，几何平均加速1.4到1.46倍。

Conclusion: ReLATE作为一种学习增强方法，在无需专家知识的情况下成功生成高效的稀疏张量表示，解决了高维稀疏数据分析中关键的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Result: 实验验证了这种采样器在探索能力和采样性能上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 连续温控扩散采样器在解决退火路径问题、增强探索及提高采样性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN v2使用tiled-block策略提高了表格数据处理能力，突破了GPU限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化TabPFN模型的上下文处理能力，超越树模型在表格数据中的表现。

Method: 引入与GPU兼容的tiled-block策略，取代传统KNN等上下文压缩方法。

Result: 在TabArena基准测试中验证了策略有效性，实现了对更大上下文的无预处理处理。

Conclusion: tiled-block策略显著提升TabPFN对长上下文表格数据处理能力。

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Conclusion: 该方法为实际推荐系统中的反事实学习和评估提供了有效指导，可在降低曝光偏差影响的同时增强模型鲁棒性并稳定评估结果。

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明扩散模型中的学习目标并非保守场，但仍能有效生成数据。新理论将其理解为匹配Wasserstein梯度流的速度场，而非逆时间SDE的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释中，扩散模型被认为学习的是噪声数据的日志密度梯度（得分函数）。但神经网络架构未强制生成保守向量场，这与理论存在矛盾。

Method: 该研究通过数值试验验证扩散网络所学的向量场不符合保守场性质。同时通过Wasserstein梯度流视角，重新解释扩散模型训练目的为匹配速度场，而非得分函数学习。

Result: 数值试验表明尽管网络未能生成保守场，扩散模型仍能有效生成数据。此外，非保守误差并不一定损害密度传输能力。

Conclusion: 提出利用Wasserstein梯度流视角可更优雅、系统地理解扩散生成模型，解释了现象与理论间的矛盾。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Conclusion: LLMDPD方法有效提升了离线强化学习的泛化和适应能力，为离线环境中的策略学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年研究关注于结合物理模型与神经网络以平衡模型的准确性和可解释性。而PERL通过学习物理模型预测与真实值间的残差进行优化，为提高效率和降低数据需求提供潜力。

Method: 研究了具备Lipschitz连续性问题的一般类别，通过分析损失函数与残差学习结构之间的关系，从理论上证明PERL的优势；同时进行了自动驾驶轨迹预测的数值实验验证。

Result: 实验显示，即使训练样本显著减少，PERL仍优于纯神经网络，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性与优势。

Conclusion: PERL能够在数据有限的情况下提高预测性能，使其在需要高精度数据的自动驾驶等领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

Motivation: 传统初始化方法如He、Xavier在超深网络中无效，缺乏对预激活均值与激活稀疏的控制，影响深度学习模型的稳定性。

Method: 利用Stiefel流形上的优化问题设计出一种专为ReLU优化的正交初始化方法，推导出封闭形式的解决方案，并提出高效的采样方案。

Result: 理论上解决了神经元失活（dying ReLU）问题，延缓激活方差的衰减，加强信号与梯度的稳定性。实验表明在MNIST及FashionMNIST等基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法适用于深度网络下的ReLU与其变种激活函数，能显著提升训练稳定性和性能，在多个数据集上的实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding增强了GNN模型对随机与对抗扰动的抵御能力，从而提升了模型整体性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Conclusion: CUFL框架通过克服数据异质性难题，有效提升个性化子图联邦学习的效率和准确性，为相关研究提供了新方法。

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Result: FP8训练性能超过FP32基线，FP4训练准确率与FP32相当。

Conclusion: Metis为低位量化下的大规模语言模型训练提供了一种高效稳定的解决方案，并公开了相关代码实现。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

TL;DR: 本文研究了提示调节的记忆能力，从理论角度分析了transformers模型对长序列处理能力的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对提示调节的理论分析有限，尤其在了解transformers处理长序列任务时。

Method: 提出了两个理论贡献：证明transformer记忆信息的上线与提示长度线性相关；首次从理论上证明transformers在扩展上下文中性能下降的现象。

Result: 理论上揭示了transformers内在的记忆限制，不论上下文长度如何，其所能保留信息是有限的。

Conclusion: 研究显示transformers模型在处理长序列时存在固有的性能瓶颈，这为理解其局限性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了激活稀疏性在大型语言模型(LLMs)中的表现，并提出了一种统一的评估稀疏性的框架及其实用指引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于ReLU的激活稀疏性研究无法直接适用于现代大规模语言模型，而后者多采用非ReLU激活函数。

Method: 提出了一种通用框架来评估稀疏性和稀疏性鲁棒性，并在现代语言模型的FFN层（包括扩散模型）中系统研究其特性。

Result: 发现LLMs中的激活稀疏性呈现一定的普遍性模式，并为其现象提供了额外的洞见。

Conclusion: 为模型设计及加速提供了基于激活稀疏性的实用指导。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Motivation: 探讨图像自回归模型训练数据记忆化的行为机理及其隐私风险。

Method: 通过测量精细的记忆化行为，分析不同架构中记忆化的模式，并对记忆化组件进行干预。

Result: 研究揭示了记忆化模式因架构而异，并通过干预最记忆化的组件，减少了数据提取能力，同时保持了生成图像质量。

Conclusion: 研究为理解图像生成模型的内部行为和减轻隐私风险提供了新视角及实践策略。

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的交通预测模型PSIRAGCN，解决了现有研究无法有效建模复杂时空相关性、忽略交通模式和空间相关性间的交互融合以及未能考虑地区异质性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时空模型在处理交通预测问题中无法有效建模不同感知视角的时空相关性，并且通常忽略了交通模式与空间相关性的交互融合，同时在地区异质性处理上存在限制。

Method: 提出了基于图卷积网络的Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN)。其中，设计了模式-空间交互融合框架和基于区域银行的消息传递机制，捕获全局到局部的模式与空间相关性，体现区域异质性。

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN通过模式-空间交互融合和区域感知设计，极大提高了交通预测的效果并兼顾了计算效率，将为城市交通管理提供有效支持。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图注意力网络（GAT）的方法对基因通路进行建模，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前ML模型中忽略基因之间已知交互结构的问题，并提升通路动态预测以及生物假设发现能力。

Method: 利用GAT模型在基因层面建模生物通路，保留通路的拓扑结构及基因交互，结合边缘干预机制增加对药物机制的编码。

Result: GAT模型在未知处理条件下的通路动态预测中将均方误差减少81%，验证了其生物先验的正确性，并成功从原始数据推断出典型基因反馈回路中的关键交互。

Conclusion: GAT模型在捕捉基因通路的生物学细节及生成新假设方面表现突出，展示出从实验数据生成新生物假设的潜力。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为Self-Centered Federated Learning (SCFL)的新攻击范式，其中攻击者不仅降低全局模型性能，还通过引入FedThief框架提升自身模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，上传的模更新无法直接验证，易受恶意攻击；当前的攻击策略通常导致全球和私有模型性能下降，而攻击者实际目标是相对竞争优势。

Method: 提出FedThief框架，通过上传篡改内容降低全局模型性能，同时利用基于分歧感知的集成技术提升私有模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时让攻击者得益于显著优于全局模型的集成模型。

Conclusion: SCFL攻击范式实现了攻击者既能破坏全局模型，又能从中获得更佳私有模型的双重目标，对现有联邦学习体系带来挑战。

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

*Lu Han,Mengyan Li,Jiping Qiang,Zhi Su*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为高级谱聚类(ASC)的新方法，用于处理数值和文本数据混合的信用监控问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信用监控方法难以处理包含金融变量和文本记录的异构数据，亟需一种能结合多类型数据的新方法。

Method: 开发了ASC方法，用优化权重参数结合数值和文本相似性，并采用特征值-轮廓优化选择特征向量。

Result: 在包含1428家中小企业的数据集上，ASC提升了轮廓得分18%，并通过比较不同聚类算法验证鲁棒性，{Δ }Intra/Inter < 0.13及{Δ }Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02。

Conclusion: ASC通过整合谱聚类理论与异构数据应用，揭示了有效信用干预的新线索，如聚焦招聘的中小企业具有更低的违约风险。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了集成多变量分割树（IMST），结合财务和文本数据，改善中小企业信用评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树难以处理高维数据和文本信息，因此需要一种结合数值和文本数据的新方法来优化中小企业的信用评估。

Method: IMST框架包含三个步骤：1. 将文本数据通过矩阵分解转化为数值矩阵；2. 使用Lasso回归选择重要财务特征；3. 基于Gini指数或熵构建多变量分割树，并通过最弱链路剪枝控制模型复杂度。

Result: 在1428家中国中小企业的实验中，IMST的准确率为88.9%，优于基线决策树（87.4%）以及传统模型（如逻辑回归和支持向量机）。

Conclusion: IMST不仅具有更高的准确性，还具有良好的解释性和计算效率，显示了在信用评估中的优势。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Conclusion: SA-DSD模型在性能、计算复杂度和参数优化方面表现优异，证明其在边缘环境中的实用性及优势。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

Conclusion: 该工具包是一个用户友好的有效解决方案，用于研究复杂系统中的短暂因果动态。

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电离层预测面临太阳、大气及磁层之间非线性耦合的挑战，在空间天气条件下传统经验模型的精准度欠佳，因此需要新的方法提高电离层TEC预测能力。

Method: 利用Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)框架，采集异质输入数据（如太阳辐照、地磁指数和GNSS观测值），并进行预处理和时间对齐以预测TEC值。

Result: 模型可实现2010至2025年数据内的24小时电离层强健预测，均方根误差低至3.33 TECU，并证明了太阳EUV辐照是最强的预测信号来源。

Conclusion: 模型不仅提升了预测精度，还通过注意力机制提供解释性，既适用于操作性任务也推动科学发现，同时开源工具ionopy促进了社区研究发展。

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

Conclusion: H-CDE框架为解决系统退化难以观察且运行变化显著的问题提供了有效方案，其创新方法在实际应用情景中展示了潜力和优势。

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

TL;DR: 本研究提出CAEL-MIPS，一种改进的离线评估方法，通过最小化MIPS估计量的均方误差（MSE）来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IPS方法方差大，MIPS虽有改进但未优化MSE且忽略上下文信息，因此需要设计更优的方法。

Method: 提出利用上下文-动作嵌入（CAEL-MIPS），通过最小化MIPS的MSE目标函数来优化策略评估。

Result: 通过理论分析和实证研究，CAEL-MIPS在合成和真实数据集上均表现出更低的MSE。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS有效缓解IPS高方差问题，同时提升了策略评估的精确性，在理论和实践上均表现优异。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VECTOR+的新方法，结合对分子性质的表示学习和可控分子生成，实现了低数据场景下药物研发中的分子优化和再采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子药物研发在低数据情况下要高效探索药物化学空间是一项主要挑战。

Method: 通过将性质引导的对比学习与分子生成技术相结合，VECTOR+方法适用于回归和分类任务。

Result: VECTOR+生成了多种新分子，在两组数据上展现了极佳的性能，达到或超越现有方法，且能设计出结构上新颖但满足药物开发需求的分子。

Conclusion: VECTOR+方法展示了低数据环境下生成符合性质要求的分子的能力，并与JT-VAE和MolGPT等方法比较，展现出高效且普适的优势，为AI辅助分子设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DELTA的隐私保护数据再编程框架，通过两阶段生成学习实现高效特征转化，保障下游任务性能的同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私敏感数据在特征工程中的需求未被现有技术充分满足，特别是需要兼顾任务效能与隐私保护。

Method: 提出DELTA框架，包括两个阶段：首先利用强化学习发现高效特征转换；其次利用基于变分LSTM的编码器-解码器模型实现效用-隐私解耦并通过对抗-因果解耦正则消除隐私信息。

Result: 在八个数据集上的实验显示，DELTA在预测性能上提高了约9.3%，隐私泄露率下降了约35%。

Conclusion: DELTA框架为隐私敏感场景下的数据特征优化任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，实现了隐私保护和数据效用的平衡。

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的模式自适应图网络（MAGN），通过可训练的神经模块实现信号分解，显著提高了预测精度并减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNN）在处理复杂的空间时间预测任务时存在波动性模式复杂和频谱纠缠的问题，因此需要设计更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了模式自适应图网络（MAGN），核心包括一个展开的变分模态分解（UVMD）模块，用固定深度网络代替传统迭代优化，并通过模式特定的可学习带宽约束实现自适应空间异质性与消除频谱重叠。

Result: 在LargeST基准测试上，相对于现有方法VMGCN，预测误差减少了85%-95%，并优于其他最先进的基线模型，同时在分解时间上提高了250倍的效率。

Conclusion: MAGN显著提高了时空预测的精度和处理效率，为复杂系统的时空预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BALD-GFlowNet，一种基于生成模型的主动学习框架，旨在解决大型无标签数据集的计算瓶颈，特别是药物发现中的虚拟筛选问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管主动学习策略（如BALD）可以优先选择信息量大的样本，但在处理包含数十亿样本的大型数据集时，计算代价过高。迫切需要一种更高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出了BALD-GFlowNet框架，该方法利用生成流网络(GFlowNets)根据BALD奖励直接生成样本，从而用生成方式替代传统的池式采样方法，突破了无标签池大小的限制。

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet表现可与标准BALD方法相媲美，且生成的分子在结构上更加多样化。

Conclusion: BALD-GFlowNet提供了一条高效且可扩展的分子发现新路径，适用于处理大规模无标签数据集。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中的稳定性-灵活性两难问题以及对资源昂贵的预训练依赖问题。

Method: 提出任务感知自适应调制（TAAM），通过轻量化的任务特定模块动态调节冻结的GNN骨干网络的计算流。

Result: TAAM在六个GCIL基准数据集上的表现全面超越了最新的现有方法。

Conclusion: TAAM通过重用现有模块和动态选择相关模块，有效提高了知识迁移与推理能力，实现了资源高效且无重放机制的持续图学习。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，所提方法与现有证据分类器和传统机器学习分类器相比提高了平均精度4.84%，且方差较低，表现出更高的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的改进算法在保留Dempster-Shafer理论优势的同时，通过信念结构增强提升了分类性能，展现了优越的效果和潜力。

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出一种解决异质图问题的新方法，通过多项式表达能力和边指向性增强节点分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN在异质图中的性能受限于其对局部同质性的依赖，有必要探索边的方向性和表达能力的结合以改进分类结果。

Method: 提出了两种架构：（1）具有多项式表达能力的GAT基线模型（Poly）；（2）一个方向感知的变体模型（Dir-Poly），分别聚合入边和出边的信息。

Result: Poly模型在五个基准数据集上优于现有基线，而Dir-Poly在具有内在方向性的图上表现更优，达到了当前最好的结果。

Conclusion: 方向性消息传递的效果依赖于具体上下文，而边方向性与特征表达能力在异质图学习中具有互补作用。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProCause，一种改进的生成方法，能够更好地评估过程挖掘中的干预策略时的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PresPM干预评估方法存在因果推理模型架构单一、无法处理时间依赖特性的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的生成方法ProCause，支持序列（如LSTMs）和非序列模型，并集成多种因果推理架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet以及模型集成）。

Result: 研究表明，相较于单一的TARNet架构，采用模型集成的方法在可靠性上更加一致，而在存在时间依赖性情况下使用LSTMs也能显著改善评估效果。

Conclusion: 通过模拟器与真实数据分析验证，ProCause能够更可靠地评估PresPM方法的实际效果。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

*Woon Yee Ng,Li Rong Wang,Siyuan Liu,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Causal SHAP框架，将因果关系融入到特征归因中，改进了传统SHAP方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP方法在解释机器学习预测时，无法区分因果和相关性，在高相关性特征时易出错。

Method: 结合PC算法进行因果关系发现和IDA算法进行因果强度量化，发展出Causal SHAP框架。

Result: Causal SHAP在降低仅与目标相关特征的归因得分方面表现更优，并通过合成和真实数据实验验证。

Conclusion: Causal SHAP框架为需要因果理解的领域（如医疗）提供了更合理的模型解释方法，有助于改善决策质量。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人才识别方法过于依赖学业成绩，忽视非学术才能，且介入时间较晚。

Method: 使用Transformer, LSTM和ANN结合打造的半监督多模态神经网络，利用离线教育数据进行人才预测。

Result: 模型在分类准确性和ROCAUC方面均达到了0.908的高水平预测性能。

Conclusion: 该模型展示了机器学习在早期人才多样化识别中的巨大潜力，为教育领域提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and
in-distribution counterfactual samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTRNet通过动态跳过大部分二次自注意力计算，同时维持较轻量的线性更新，实现了计算效率和性能的提升，成为Transformer的高效替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在应用于所有token时，需要执行计算量巨大的二次自注意力操作，针对性优化此部分可以显著降低计算成本。

Method: 设计DTRNet架构，通过动态路由技术，仅对约10%的token执行完整的二次注意力更新，其余token采用轻量级线性更新方式，保留MLP模块，降低整体计算量。

Result: DTRNet即使大幅减少了执行注意力的token数量，仍在性能上与传统全Transformer相媲美，并在精确度和内存效率上优于其他路由式跳层方法（如MoD和D-LLM）。其效率提升尤为适用于长序列输入。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过解耦token更新与注意力计算，显著降低了二次计算成本，提供了简单、高效且可扩展的Transformer替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文研究图神经网络中的特征共享现象（Superposition）影响网络的可解释性，以简单的几何诊断方法分析潜在空间中特征的表现形式，并探讨如何通过设计选择改善可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图神经网络中，消息传播会混合信号，内部通道很难与人类的直观概念对齐，导致模型的解释性受到限制。研究特征共享现象可以进一步理解GNN的内部结构及其可解释性。

Method: 利用控制实验，研究了图概念下的特征表现方式：（i）节点层级的线性探针方向；（ii）图级的条件类中心特征。随后通过基于空间几何的诊断方法分析特征表现，并研究宽度、拓扑、池化方式、激活方式等设计选择对表现的影响。

Result: 研究发现，增加网络宽度会导致Overlap相变化，拓扑结构对节点特征的影响通过池化部分再混合成与任务对齐的图轴；更尖锐的池化方法能够提高轴对齐性并减少通道共享；浅层模型可能会形成低秩嵌入的稳定状态。这些发现为改进GNN的可解释性提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 这篇论文连接了表示几何与设计选择的关系，提出使用几何诊断方法分析潜在空间特征布局，并建议改进图神经网络可解释性的实用路径，比如通过调整宽度、池化及最终激活方式等方法。

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

### [522] [SCOUT: Toward Sub-Quadratic Attention via Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00935)
*Aref Jafari,Yuhe Fan,Benyamin Jamialahmadi,Parsa Farinneya,Boxing Chen,Marzieh S. Tahaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SCOUT，一种混合架构，通过在固定大小的段内局部压缩tokens，并基于这些压缩的表示进行注意力计算，从而在保持Transformer可表达性的同时，大幅降低计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在序列建模任务中表现卓越，但其二次方注意力复杂度限制了其在长序列上的可扩展性。因此，需要设计既能高效处理长序列又能保留足够信息的方法。

Method: SCOUT通过局部压缩和稀疏关注结合的方式，应对长序列场景。具体而言，对tokens进行线性局部混合以整合最近的上下文信息，再稀疏关注少量的压缩检查点tokens以总结输入历史，减少注意力计算。

Result: SCOUT在长上下文语言建模和推理任务中表现出色，超过相同计算预算下的长序列baseline模型，并与全注意力Transformer在400M和1.3B规模的任务中表现一致。此外，其端到端吞吐量超过SOTA模型，同时在长序列基准测试中取得相当的结果。

Conclusion: SCOUT在保持Transformer表达能力的情况下，显著提高了效率，证明了在长序列建模任务中的实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个自适应采样训练方法（ART），通过基于类性能调整训练数据分布，以提高在不平衡分类任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不平衡数据处理方法忽略了类学习难度的动态变化，限制了模型的整体性能。因此，需要一种方法能够动态适应分类难度。

Method: 提出了ART方法，通过定期计算类别的宏F1分数动态调整类别采样比例，目标是提升学习性能并关注表现欠佳的类别。

Result: ART在各类数据集的实验中优于传统方法，包括SMOTE等。特别是在表格式数据集上，宏F1提升平均达到2.64个百分点。

Conclusion: ART在不同不平衡数据任务中表现稳定，结果具有统计显著性，证明其是处理不平衡分类任务的可靠方法。

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

Conclusion: MEPT是一种有效且高效的流形映射框架，为动态适应非平稳数据分布提供了解决方案，为参数高效微调开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MDMs无法支持灵活长度生成，这限制了其应用场景，本文希望解决这一问题并保留MDMs在任意顺序推断中的优势。

Method: 作者利用了一种扩展的随机插值框架，提出了FlexMDMs，这种方法通过插入mask标记并解除屏蔽来生成序列。该模型还支持对已有模型进行微调以转化为FlexMDM。

Result: FlexMDMs在长度建模上显著优于MDMs，并在合成迷宫规划任务中成功率提高约60%。微调后的FlexMDMs在数学和代码补全任务上也实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: FlexMDMs突破了MDMs固定长度生成的限制，同时保留了其任意顺序推断能力，展示出在多个任务上的优越性能，是离散扩散模型领域的重要改进。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本篇论文提出了一种结合IMU数据的新型方法，用于识别和去除EEG信号中的运动伪影，显著提升了处理运动伪影的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规EEG信号由于生理和外界伪影影响，信噪比较低，尤其是运动伪影极大地阻碍了脑机接口在实际中应用。现有方法往往只依赖单一模式信号，未能有效利用如IMU记录的多模态数据。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于微调大脑模型(LaBraM)的相关注意力映射方法，结合IMU测得的运动信号，利用其空间通道关系识别EEG信号中的运动伪影。模型包含约920万参数，并使用5.9小时的EEG和IMU记录进行训练。

Result: 在不同时间尺度和运动活动下，新方法与ASR-ICA基准对比时表现更为优越，证明引入IMU参考信号后，运动情况下的鲁棒性显著增强。

Conclusion: 结合IMU多模态数据的LaBraM方法显著提升了EEG信号处理的性能，为应对实际应用中的运动伪影问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

TL;DR: 引入了一种框架RefineStat，用于增强小型语言模型生成的概率程序的语义约束和诊断能力，从而提高程序的合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在生成概率程序时因语义和语法错误导致程序可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 提出RefineStat框架，通过加入语义约束和诊断后优化机制，确保生成程序的分布和参数的正确性，并在必要时重新采样组件。

Result: RefineStat生成的程序在语法和统计可靠性上优于或等于某些闭源的大型语言模型（如OpenAI o3）。

Conclusion: RefineStat有效增强了小型语言模型在概率程序生成任务中的能力，可提供高质量、可靠的结果。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Conclusion: CCE是一种高效、鲁棒的评价指标，结合RankEval平台可为时间序列异常检测指标研究提供新标准。

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Conclusion: SC-GIR框架通过学习紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表示，提高了通信效率和下游任务表现，展示出该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Conclusion: 提出一种支持非线性数据分布的执行预测新方案，有助于实现理论与实际情景间的更高一致性。

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ADMP-GNN能够解决传统GNN模型中消息传递层数固定的问题，更灵活地适应节点的多样化需求，从而改进任务表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过有效捕捉时间序列的潜在模式和依赖关系，实现了对xLSTM的显著改进，适用于复杂的时间序列预测任务。

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种关系保持损失（RPL）函数，用以减少降维过程中向量空间性质的失真，实验表明该方法在减少维度的同时保持了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在降维过程中，向量空间性质（如正交性与线性无关性）的失真会影响跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务，需要一种更好的方法来维持这些性质。

Method: 提出关系保持损失（RPL）函数，通过对高维数据与低维嵌入的关系矩阵（如Gram矩阵或余弦矩阵）之间差异的最小化，进行非线性投影降维，并利用矩阵扰动理论推导误差界限。

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL可以在减少嵌入维度的同时，较好地保留关键向量空间性质，从而在下游任务中维持原有性能。

Conclusion: RPL在降维任务中表现出色，且具有广泛应用潜力，包括跨域对齐、迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性与不变性、图与流形学习以及联邦学习等场景。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN分析框架主要侧重于高表达能力，但这种框架在实际任务中并不总是必要，而且未能考虑实际限制。

Method: 提出消息传递复杂度（MPC）这一连续量度，通过捕捉诸如过度压缩等实际限制来评估GNN架构的难度，同时保留经典表达能力理论中的不可能性结果。

Result: 通过对基础GNN任务的大量验证，结果显示MPC的理论预测与实际表现相吻合，成功解释GNN架构的优劣。

Conclusion: MPC超越了传统的表达能力理论，为理解和改进GNN架构提供了一个更强大和精细的框架。

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Conclusion: 所提方法实现了低通信量下的有效协作决策，特别是在大规模边缘计算环境中表现优异。

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: 迭代式少样本选择和明确的推理指令能有效改善LLMs的推理与泛化能力，尤其是对以简单示例为训练的数据。

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种称为E-UNO（等变U型神经算子）的模型，用于解决二元混合物相分离中Cahn-Hilliard方程的问题，具有高效率和准确性，尤其是在捕捉细尺度和高频结构方面效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数值求解器尽管精确，但计算代价高且在不同初始条件和几何结构下灵活性不足。同时，现有的神经算子架构在捕捉多尺度行为和物理对称性方面表现有限。

Method: 提出一种基于等变U型神经算子的架构（E-UNO），结合了全局谱卷积与多分辨率U形结构，并通过限定平移等变性与物理对齐，从短期历史动力学中学习相场变量的演化。

Result: E-UNO在时空预测的准确性方面超过了Fourier神经算子和传统U型神经算子基线模型，特别是在细尺度和高频结构的处理上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过对对称性和尺度层次的编码，E-UNO不仅提升了泛化能力，减少了训练数据需求，还能够保持物理一致性，成为复杂相场系统的高效替代解决方案。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

*Li Rong Wang,Thomas C. Henderson,Yew Soon Ong,Yih Yng Ng,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出基于重建不确定性估计（RUE）的预测区间（PIs）计算方法，用于提高深度学习模型在临床生命体征预测中的可信性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前深度学习模型在预测生命体征方面表现出潜力，但在临床应用中仍受限于模型输出的可信度和解释性。特别是缺乏可靠的不确定性量化工具，难以判断异常预测是否具有临床意义。

Method: 提出两种基于RUE的预测区间（PIs）计算方法： （1）基于高斯copula分布的参数方法，用于计算闭式预测区间；（2）基于k最近邻（KNN）的非参数方法，通过类似的验证实例经验估计条件误差分布。

Result: 在两类公共数据集（高频和低频健康信号）上的实验表明，高斯copula方法在低频数据上表现优于对照基线，而KNN方法在高频数据中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE导出的预测区间在提高生命体征预测的可解释性和不确定性意识方面具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DEPO的训练管道，旨在通过优化数据选择策略提升大型推理模型的性能，显著降低训练成本和提高数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在扩展推理能力时需要大量计算和数据，成本高且效率低。

Method: 提出了DEPO管道，结合离线和在线数据选择策略。在离线阶段筛选高质量训练样本，在线阶段引入样本可探索性指标，并通过重复机制平衡训练。

Result: 在五个推理基准上表现优于现有方法，仅用20%数据，实现了显著加速。

Conclusion: DEPO方法通过优化数据筛选显著提升了数据效率和模型收敛表现，降低了训练计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活的预训练框架FMAE，用于解决电池管理中的多任务问题，并在多个任务和数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电池管理方法需要大量数据和工程投入，限制了智能电池管理的规模化，因此需要一种更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE)，这是一种灵活的预训练框架，能够在数据缺失的情况下学习统一的电池表示，并利用数据片段间的互相关性。同时具备跨任务应用的能力。

Result: FMAE在五个电池管理任务和十一组数据集上均超越了所有任务专用方法。在剩余寿命预测任务中，比现有方法减少50倍推理数据的同时，仍保持最先进性能。此外，在真实数据缺少某些信息（如系统电压）情况下，性能仅有轻微影响，但与最佳手工特征结果相当。

Conclusion: FMAE证明了一种灵活且数据有效的模型，可以简化动态系统的多任务管理，并具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用恢复理论的新型优化框架，通过分析参数空间分区函数的渐近级数提取目标函数全局结构信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对局部梯度优化方法缺乏目标函数全局信息、收敛至次优值以及对初值敏感的问题。

Method: 基于恢复理论，通过计算小耦合参数下的分区函数及其渐近级数系数，识别对应目标函数关键值的Borel平面奇异点。

Result: 该方法可提供目标函数的全局指导，使局部优化器能够更有效地调节学习率并跳出次优区域。

Conclusion: 相比于传统启发式方法，该方法通过优化景观的几何特征理论证明其有效性。

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于机器学习的降水预测方法，引入高级暴雨（AT）损失函数，通过改进优化目标提高预测精度。


<details>

Motivation: 为了应对气候变化，提供更精确的降雨预测，同时弥补传统方法和现有机器学习方法的局限性，例如关键成功指标（CSI）在干旱阶段的低效性。

Method: 提出了一种简单的惩罚表达式，并将其重新解释为二维无约束二进制优化（QUBO）形式。随后通过近似过程，将其转化为高级暴雨（AT）损失函数，并进行实验验证。

Result: 通过Lipschitz常数、预测性能评估、一致性实验以及消融研究验证，AT损失函数显示出其优越性。

Conclusion: 新的AT损失函数能够在提高降雨预测性能的同时克服传统损失函数的不足，为气候建模和预测提供了一个更有效的工具。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Conclusion: 通过因果影响分析，方法能够较优地推荐用户下一步行动地点，表明该方法在因果关系建模上的贡献。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

TL;DR: 提出DPF-CM框架，用于中医语言模型训练与部署中的数据处理和隐私保护，改进模型性能并降低数据隐私泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前中文医学语言模型训练缺乏对训练数据处理的深入研究，存在优化空间。

Method: 框架由两个模块组成：1. 针对模型训练的数据处理管线，包括上下文学习生成指令和基于集成的偏好数据筛选机制；2. 针对隐私保护的隐私向量数据库，涵盖四个阶段减少隐私泄露。

Result: 实验结果表明，DPF-CM大幅提高模型准确性，使训练的中文医学模型性能达开源领域领先水平，同时降低训练数据隐私泄露27%。

Conclusion: DPF-CM可以优化现有中文医学语言模型的训练与部署，显著提升性能并增强隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Conclusion: 研究证明CbLDM在提升纳米结构逆问题精度和生成效率上的显著优势，未来可以应用于更广泛的条件生成任务。

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Motivation: 消息传递架构在处理节点与图预测任务时，对长范围依赖建模能力不足，亟需通过新方法改进。

Method: 采用分层图结构与自适应随机游走，结合引入可学习的转移概率，融合了原始图及分层快捷方式。

Result: 在一项合成的长范围任务上，证明此方案可超越传统基于原始拓扑的理论限制。偏好分层结构的游走在效果上等同于在原始图上需更长游走的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效处理大规模图并有效捕获长范围依赖提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

Conclusion: 选取潜在变量的高概率子集能够简化VQ-VAE模型，同时保留其生成表现力并提高推断效率。

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在信用评分中使用实例依赖的成本敏感（IDCS）分类器对模型解释稳定性的影响，发现尽管IDCS分类器提高了成本效率，但其解释在数据不平衡的情况下表现出较低的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当下对模型透明性和可解释性要求日益增加，但在信用评分领域，针对实例的成本敏感分类器对模型解释稳定性的影响尚未探讨。研究旨在弥补这一领域的空白。

Method: 利用四个公开的信用评分数据集评估IDCS分类器的区分能力与成本效率，并通过引入新指标提升跨数据集的可比性。同时，在控制数据类不平衡的情况下，通过重采样考察SHAP与LIME的特征重要性排名的稳定性。

Result: 研究显示IDCS分类器在成本效率方面有改进，但在解释稳定性，尤其是类不平衡情况下，表现较差，凸显了优化成本与模型可解释性间的权衡。

Conclusion: 鉴于对模型可解释性的监管需求，研究指出解决IDCS分类器的不稳定性问题刻不容缓，以确保成本效益不会因不稳定或不可信的解释而被削弱。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Conclusion: MD-PNOP框架能够大幅降低参数化PDE求解的计算成本，同时保证物理方程的约束和可解释性，是一种高效且架构无关的加速方法。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity

Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of
deep learning models. Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster
convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the
diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct
comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM
pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and
training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance
to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For
researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization
research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully
reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous
benchmarking of future methods.

### [561] [Hierarchical Motion Captioning Utilizing External Text Data Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01471)
*Clayton Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，旨在改进现有运动描述生成方法，通过分层策略提高低层次和高层次运动描述的准确性，并在三个数据集中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动文字数据集中高层次描述稀缺，低层次描述欠缺，制约了运动描述生成模型的表现。

Method: 采用两步分层方法：首先利用大型语言模型生成每个高层次描述的详细低层次描述，重新训练运动到文本模型；其次引入检索机制，将低层描述与高层候选描述对齐并组合运动特征生成精确高层描述。

Result: 在HumanML3D、KIT和BOTH57M三个数据集上的平均性能（BLEU-1、BLEU-4、CIDEr、ROUGE-L）相比于现有最优方法M2T-Interpretable提高6%到50%。

Conclusion: 通过引入外部文本知识并改进运动描述生成流程，显著提升了数据集中未覆盖运动的描述准确性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PAFlow的新模型，用于基于结构的药物设计，显示出在生成高亲和力3D分子方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在稳定性和分子与蛋白质口袋几何匹配方面存在不足，导致分子质量不一致和离靶效应。

Method: PAFlow结合流匹配框架，采用条件流匹配方法，加入蛋白-配体相互作用预测器指导生成，并基于蛋白口袋几何设计原子数预测器。

Result: 在CrossDocked2020基准测试中，PAFlow达到了新的结合亲和力指标的最高水平（Vina评分可达-8.31），同时保持良好的分子属性。

Conclusion: PAFlow改进了现有技术在生成高亲和分子与目标几何对齐方面的表现，有助于药物设计领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Conclusion: 该框架在减少存储需求的同时提升了异常检测的性能，为心电图分析提供了一种高效方法。

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FoRo的前向学习、不依赖梯度的持续学习方法，用于解决传统方法中灾难性遗忘问题，同时降低了计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是现有的持续学习方法需要冻结预训练模型的大部分参数，同时依赖梯度回传与优化，这种过程计算密集且不适合资源受限环境。

Method: 提出了一种基于轻量化Prompt调优的策略，并结合一种新的知识编码机制。Prompt嵌入通过输入层插入并采用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)优化，随后通过非线性随机投影和递归最小二乘方法将任务特定知识编码到知识编码矩阵中。

Result: 实验表明，FoRo大幅降低了平均遗忘率并提高了准确率，同时显著降低了内存使用和运行时间。

Conclusion: FoRo方法在保持高知识保留的情况下，实现了高效率和高效果，尤其适用于资源受限环境中的多媒体应用场景。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL)在无监督学习中的实际表现，特别是与未经训练的基线模型相比的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究假设GCL对图数据学习具有很高的效能，但作者希望验证这个假设是否在没有训练的基线模型下仍然成立。

Method: 作者比较了GCL与未经训练的Graph Neural Networks（GNNs）、简单的多层感知机和手工统计在不同数据集规模与任务难度下的表现。

Result: 在小数据集上，未经训练的基线模型可以与GCL匹敌甚至超越；但在更大的数据集（如ogbg-molhiv）上，GCL的表现优于基线模型，但其提升幅度有一个上限；在合成数据集上，GCL精度随数据量呈对数增长，并与任务复杂度密切相关。

Conclusion: 数据集规模和任务复杂度对GCL的相对表现至关重要，因此需要设计新的算法以克服性能瓶颈，并清楚区分基准测试中的数据集对比意义。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac导向的条件流匹配方法能有效完成生成模型的导向任务，解决高维与特定几何限制下的问题，并提供开源代码以供拓展。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MergeLock的主动保护机制，有效防止未经授权的模型合并，降低合并模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多的微调模型公开发布，未经授权的模型合并可能侵犯开发者权益并泄露敏感信息，急需解决这一安全问题。

Method: 通过在Transformer模型注意力机制中随机引入可逆矩阵，在保持模型输出不变的情况下扰乱参数，阻止其与其他模型共享参数空间。

Result: 实验表明，MergeLock在大多数情况下能使合并模型性能下降95%以上，且低成本恢复方法无法有效恢复被保护的模型。

Conclusion: MergeLock是一种有效的保护机制，可增强模型对未经授权合并的鲁棒性，为模型安全提供新思路。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

Conclusion: 该框架为实现更高效、更具针对性的激励政策个性化提供了实践可行的路径，可显著提升推荐系统的经济收益。

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

Motivation: 随着移动和可穿戴传感技术的普及，连续和个性化监测情绪、情感障碍和压力成为可能。但数据缺失和不规则自报告时间使得预测人类状态和行为具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Ema2Vec的时间嵌入方法，可以有效处理不规则时间间隔的自报告数据，并用于纵向压力预测。

Result: Ema2Vec在压力预测任务上优于基于固定每日时间窗口的方法和未考虑时间表达的模型。

Conclusion: 在建模不规则采样的纵向数据时，时间嵌入的引入至关重要。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Conclusion: OCFL为CFL提供了一种无需手动调整的高效解决方案，提升模型个性化及预测可解释性，同时改善了CFL的实用性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类移动数据的复杂性和多样性，传统的深度学习方法容易导致模型训练效率低下和潜在的欠拟合，同时仅预测下一个位置忽略了隐含的影响因素（如距离和方向），从而限制了预测效果。

Conclusion: 该研究通过熵驱动课程学习和多任务学习显著提升了大规模人类移动预测的性能与训练效率，为未来更复杂的移动预测模型提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Result: 识别了分布性偏差对梯度因果发现的影响，展示消除因素竞争有助于提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过控制分布偏差，可以改进梯度因果发现，使模型对因果结构推断更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

Motivation: 现有ADMM-DDP方法需要调节复杂的超参数来平衡局部任务性能与全局协作，而这是一个高成本且复杂的过程。

Method: 开发了L2C框架，利用轻量级神经网络元学习超参数，并在分布式ADMM-DDP管道上端到端优化，同时使用Riccati递归等组件提高元梯度计算效率。

Conclusion: L2C显著提升了多任务分布式轨迹优化的效率和适应性，特别是在复杂任务场景中的应用潜力巨大。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 通过理论和实验的结合，该研究明确了RTB目标在KL正则化强化学习方法中的角色及其效果，从而强化了这一领域的理论框图。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Method: 通过实验展示蒸馏如何改善测试时扩展性并研究其对上下文学习能力的折中影响，利用二元模型sandbox实验解析其背后原理，并提供设计建议。

Result: 蒸馏预训练显著提升了测试时的扩展性，但削弱了上下文学习能力，特别是对归纳头的影响。

Conclusion: 虽然蒸馏技术在模型扩展性上表现优异，但其对上下文学习性能的负面效应需特别关注，研究揭示了优化预训练设计的潜在方向。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Motivation: 现有DeepONet模型在简单性与效率上具有优势，但在精度上存在局限。同时，高精度变体则需付出较大的训练时间代价，有改进的空间。

Method: 提出了若干变体，通过在DeepONet的分支网络和主干网络间引入双向交叉条件化机制，并加入查询点信息和输入函数信息，保持模型简单高效的同时提升表现。

Result: 在对流、扩散反应、Burgers’及Korteweg-de Vries等四类PDE基准实验中，变体在匹配甚至超越高精度DeepONet的同时显著提高了训练效率，并展现了与方程特性相一致的性能优势。

Conclusion: 论文证明双向交叉条件化的有效性，与方程底层物理特性紧密相关，并通过多种统计验证展示了其稳健性。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Conclusion: 通过引入强化学习和环境工具机制，小型模型代理能够在任务性能上超过更大的静态模型代理。

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Conclusion: 这种方法不仅适用于损坏检测，还可扩展至汽车安全、自动驾驶等其他应用领域，提高相关系统的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，SoLS以显著优势（至少提高17%）超过现有方法，并显著降低计算资源需求，推理速度提升5-60倍。

Conclusion: SoLS方法优化了基础模型在多回合任务中的表现，为多回合任务中的强化学习提供了一种更高效的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

Conclusion: 通过频谱归一化与改进滤波器设计，可有效减少EEG设备和背景噪声差异对机器学习分析的干扰，为自动化伪影清除提供助力，在临床EEG分析中具有潜在价值。

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

Conclusion: 研究为公正性与持续学习两个领域搭建了一座桥梁，提出了一种具有前景的机器学习系统构建方法，兼具公平性与效率。

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Conclusion: MBT-CB模型表现出色，可优化心血管疾病生物标志物预测，有助于在大流行期间支持临床决策。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为E-ICL+FCP的高效全覆盖预测框架，该方法通过无需实际重训练的方式实现了计算效率和覆盖范围的良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全覆盖预测方法面临数据效率或计算开销过大的问题，需要找到一种兼具效率与覆盖的解决方案。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的元学习方法，并针对全覆盖预测设计了特定的损失函数，模拟多次重训练模型的效果而无需实际重训练。

Result: 在合成数据和真实任务上的实验表明，E-ICL+FCP框架在效率与覆盖权衡上优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架能够显著降低全覆盖预测的计算复杂度，同时保证覆盖率，为可信AI中的不确定性量化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

*Qifu Wen,Xi Zeng,Zihan Zhou,Shuaijun Liu,Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Reza Rawassizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GradES方法，用于通过梯度收敛动态地停止各个部分的更新，从而优化Transformer模型的微调效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的早停方法过于依赖验证损失且计算成本高，尤其是在大型Transformer中，于是提出更高效的动态梯度停止策略。

Method: 通过监测Transformer微调过程中不同组件的梯度大小，当组件梯度小于设定的阈值时停止更新这些组件。GradES通过局部冻结参数来减少验证计算的成本，同时允许慢收敛的参数继续学习。

Result: GradES在训练时间上加快了1.57-7.22倍，同时在平均准确率上提升了1.2%。

Conclusion: GradES方法提高了效率和泛化能力，表现出较高的计算性能和效果。

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Motivation: 现有通过权重分析模型特征的方法存在性能下降和数据效率低的问题，作者旨在改善这一问题，增强机器学习模型的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入了一种名为Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS)的激活函数，使Gated Linear Units (GLUs)能够高效地学习可解释特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，SQS在实现权重可解释性的同时，保持了与当前最先进激活函数相当的性能。

Conclusion: SQS激活函数提供了一种有效的方法，通过改进权重可解释性，提高了模型分析的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based
interpretability

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习和共享自动驾驶车辆的半按需交通接驳服务，通过动态区域调度优化公共交通系统中的接驳运输效率与便利性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低密度地区公共交通接驳问题，提升覆盖率和服务效率，同时结合固定线路交通的经济性与按需交通的灵活性。

Method: 设计了一种基于深度强化学习的动态车辆区域分配模型，采用近端策略优化算法（Proximal Policy Optimization），通过模拟实验验证模型的有效性。

Result: 在慕尼黑真实公交线路的模拟中，提出的服务模式相比传统线路能服务更多乘客（提升16%），但成本仅略有增加（提升13%）。优化后的RL控制进一步提升效率：乘客增加2.4%，成本仅增加1.4%。

Conclusion: 研究展示了利用共享自动驾驶车辆和机器学习技术改进公共交通接驳服务的潜力，为多模式交通系统中解决首末公里问题的进一步创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Motivation: 传统的优化方法计算时间过长且需要算法设计领域知识，无法满足灾后紧急情况中对快速决策的需求。

Method: 提出了一种注意力机制编码解码模型（AEDM），结合深度强化学习，用于灾后无人机路径规划，并开发了网络转化方法和合成路网生成技术。此外，采用多任务学习和多优策略优化进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型比商业求解器在质量上提升16-69%，推断速度为1-2秒（传统方法需100-2000秒），在不同规模问题上具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时兼顾了解决方案质量，是灾后紧急响应中快速决策的理想选择，具有重要实际意义。

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）与车辆基本属性如何共同影响车辆达到最高NCAP安全评级的可能性。

Method: 基于NCAP公开数据，使用逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和支持向量机分类器进行预测比较，对最优性能的随机森林和梯度提升模型进行超参数优化。

Result: 优化后的随机森林模型在测试集上的表现最佳，准确率达89.18%，ROC AUC为0.9586；车辆基本属性（如重量、年份）占主要预测权重，ADAS特性也有重要贡献。

Conclusion: 结合车辆基本参数与ADAS功能的机器学习模型可以有效预测最高的NCAP安全评级，为安全性评价提供数据驱动的分析方法。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VISP的新方法，通过利用梯度波动性动态调整噪声注入，有效改善深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中由于过拟合导致的泛化问题，利用梯度波动性信息来指导噪声注入从而优化网络性能。

Method: VISP通过从梯度统计中计算波动性，并使用其调整投影矩阵的噪声比例，选择性地正则化高波动性节点，同时保留稳定的特征表示。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP显著改善了泛化性能，并优于固定噪声方法。

Conclusion: VISP方法有效减轻了过拟合问题，增强了网络内部动态的稳定性，并促进了更稳健的特征表示。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Conclusion: 证明了构建在非i.i.d.数据上的因果解缠模型具有理论和实践上的可行性，为因果推理问题提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Motivation: 提高神经架构搜索（NAS）的效率并优化多目标性能，尤其是在计算预算受限的情况下。

Method: 提出了自适应协同克里金辅助多保真多目标NAS算法，结合聚类的局部多保真填充采样策略，以及引入了一种新型的连续编码方法，减少搜索变量和维度。

Result: 该算法在有限的计算预算下，在三种数值基准、2D Darcy流回归问题和CHASE_DB1生物医学图像分割问题上表现优于现有的最先进方法。此外，在城市建模中的风速回归问题中也取得了优秀表现，同时减少了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 所提算法不仅效率高，还能自动发现支持其他文献中优越U-Net架构的设计原则，例如每个单元能够融入先前单元的信息的重要性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Motivation: 验证CSG在知识图谱链接预测任务中的表现，评估其作为数据集复杂性度量的可靠性。

Method: 分析CSG在链接预测任务中的两个关键参数对其稳定性和预测能力的影响，使用多个标准知识图谱数据集进行实验测试。

Result: 发现CSG对参数K非常敏感，无法自然地随着目标类数量扩展，并且与常见绩效指标（如MRR）相关性较差。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测场景下并不是一个可靠的度量方法，需要开发更加鲁棒且与分类器无关的复杂性度量方法。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Conclusion: 新提出的PT-BPS結合算法能有效應對多模態分布的挑戰，並且在設置參數方面較其他方法更加簡單，具有實用性潛力。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了动态Guardian模型，其根据用户定义的政策动态评估文本，能够适应不同应用领域，而不局限于静态Guardian模型的固定类别检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Guardian模型只能检测预先定义的静态危害类别，无法适应多样化场景的需求，需根据用户制定的政策动态进行文本评估。

Method: 提出动态Guardian模型，可以快速检测政策违规行为，也可以利用链式思维推理来解释和验证模型的输出。

Result: 动态Guardian模型在检测静态危害类别的准确性上与静态模型相当，同时能够以更快速度实现更灵活的自由政策违规检测，且准确性与前沿推理模型相当。

Conclusion: 动态Guardian模型兼顾检测效率与灵活性，能够更适配多样化领域和动态变化的需求。

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

### [604] [Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046)
*Kaiyue Wen,David Hall,Tengyu Ma,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdamW优化器尽管面临许多声称更快的替代方案，但仍主导着语言模型的预训练。本文指出，先前研究在超参数调优和评估方法上存在方法学问题，导致比较不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨替代优化器速度提升的真实性及其适用性，同时揭示评估方法学上的问题。

Method: 针对10种深度学习优化器，结合4种模型规模和数据-模型比，进行了系统性研究，并优化了超参数与指标评估。

Result: 发现优化器的超参数调优对公平性至关重要，而大部分替代优化器的速度提升随模型规模扩展减小，1.2B参数规模时仅为1.1倍。

Conclusion: 矩阵型优化器提供了最快的速度提升，但其优势随模型规模扩展逐渐缩小，提示在选择优化器时需要考虑规模和实际预训练需求。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

*Yi Yin,Guangquan Zhang,Hua Zuo,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的双层优化框架，用于生成隐私保护的数据集，该方法在提高数据隐私的同时，最大限度地保持数据的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据共享面临隐私泄露的风险，如成员推断攻击（MIA），现有隐私保护技术通常降低了数据的准确性和多样性，限制了下游任务的性能。因此，需要在隐私保护和数据效用之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出了一种双层优化框架：上层任务注重数据效用，通过判别器生成高质量样本；下层任务注重数据隐私，通过局部外在曲率量化样本对MIA的脆弱性，并将样本向低曲率区域扰动以增强隐私保护。

Result: 通过交替优化两目标，该方法在隐私保护能力、样本质量和多样性方面均优于现有方法。实验验证表明下游任务对MIA的抗性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何化的方法实现了隐私和效用的协同平衡，并具有卓越的适用性，提供了一种有效的隐私保护数据发布解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为LUCIE-3D的轻量级三维气候模拟器，使用Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO)框架，成功再现了多种气候现象并具有高效性和长期稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的目的是开发一种高效而稳定的三维气候模拟工具，能够捕捉大气的垂直结构、响应气候变化驱动因素并适用于长期模拟。

Method: LUCIE-3D基于LUCIE-2D框架，采用SFNO神经网络，训练使用30年ERA5再分析数据，模型将大气CO2作为驱动变量，同时可选择整合海表温度（SST）以模拟海--气耦合动态。

Result: LUCIE-3D准确再现了气候均值、变率以及长期气候变化信号，能够捕捉关键动力过程如赤道开尔文波、MJO（马登-朱利安振荡）和环状模态，同时在极端事件统计上也表现可信。

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D具备稳定性、物理一致性和高效特性，是快速实验、消融研究以及耦合气候动力探索的宝贵工具，并可应用于古气候研究和未来地球系统模拟。

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据依赖的平滑框架，用于改进扩散模型在稀疏高维数据上的生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在处理稀疏且分布不均匀的数据时忽视数据依赖变化的问题。

Method: 采用核密度估计（KDE）作为预处理步骤，根据每个数据点估算噪声规模σ，并结合这些数据依赖的σ值训练得分模型。

Result: 实验证明，提出的方法在多个指标上均表现出一致改进。

Conclusion: 数据感知的σ预测对稀疏高维数据的生成建模非常重要。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进职业事故报告自动分类，解决类别不平衡导致的模型性能下降问题，尤其是对罕见但严重事故类型。

Method: 提出ABEX-RAT框架，结合二步抽象-扩展数据生成（ABEX）和随机对抗训练（RAT），生成高质量的合成样本并提升分类器的泛化能力。

Result: 实验在OSHA数据集上表现出色，取得了macro-F1 90.32%的新SOTA成绩，显著优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: ABEX-RAT框架是一种高效、有效的手段，用于处理专业领域中类别不平衡的分类任务，且优于粗暴模型微调策略。

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 传统的信息论多视角学习方法过于依赖“多视角冗余假设”，忽略了视角中特有信息的潜力。为弥补此不足，研究者提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了CIML框架，结合信息论方法，同时学习视角间的公共信息和独特信息，并证明其综合表示对下游任务的预测能力。

Result: 通过实验表明，CIML在多个数据集上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: CIML突破了多视角冗余假设局限，展示了其理论价值与实用性。

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Motivation: 解决多任务学习中因任务数量增加而导致的任务干扰问题，并改进当前模型合并方法的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Method: 利用Jensen-Shannon散度指导模型合并过程，无需额外标注数据，自动平衡任务的重要性，同时保持对多个任务的强性能表现。

Result: 提出的方法在多个任务数量增长的情况下表现出更高的鲁棒性和一致性的超越现有工作性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为多任务学习提供了一种有效的模型合并解决方案，显著改进了性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Conclusion: 论文展示了EM算法可微版本的巨大潜力，通过理论支持与应用案例验证了其在复杂任务中实际可行性。

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Conclusion: \dataset数据集成为恶意软件检测领域的重要工具，有助于代码混淆和恶意软件进化的鲁棒性分析。

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau

\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large

computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot

direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了如何以在线、数据驱动方式构建准确的因果模型，推动了IT系统管理任务的自动化。

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新方法Conditional-$t^3$VAE，通过引入每类Student's t分布先验以缓解不平衡数据集中潜在空间分配不均的问题，显著提升生成公平性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在变分自编码器中，现有模型使用全球先验会导致潜在空间分配与训练集的类别频率一致，从而弱化了长尾类别的表示且影响生成的公平性和多样性。

Method: 提出了一种Conditional-$t^3$VAE模型，定义每类Student's t分布联合先验，并基于γ-功率散度优化目标函数，同时引入平衡混合的潜在变量生成机制。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE在严重类别不平衡情况下，相较于$t^3$VAE和基于高斯分布的VAE基准模型，FID分数更低，生成结果更加公平；在类别F1评分中也表现更优。

Conclusion: Conditional-$t^3$VAE模型显著改善了极端类别不平衡情境中潜在空间的公平分配和生成的多样性，且对生成式任务提供了更具竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了验证预测精确度与优化解质量之间的关系，特别是在复杂受约束的优化问题中，这一关联在现有文献中未被全面分析。

Method: 提出了用于模拟多分类器预测的新算法，并进行计算实验，分析预测误差对解的影响，并将其应用于机器调度问题的预测-优化方法性能评估。

Result: 实验表明，分类器性能可被合理准确地模拟，但存在一定的变异性，同时发现预测误差与解的最优性距离的关系非线性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了设计和评估基于机器学习预测的决策系统时，需要考虑预测误差对系统性能的非线性影响。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DaCe AD，一种无需代码修改的高效自动微分引擎，在科学计算中性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动微分框架在编程语言支持、代码修改需求、科学计算性能和数据存储等方面存在局限性，限制了领域科学家处理大型问题的能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于ILP的新算法，通过优化存储与重新计算之间的权衡，在给定内存限制下实现最高性能。

Result: 将方法应用于NPBench基准套件中，与JAX工具相比，性能提升了92倍以上，无需代码更改。

Conclusion: DaCe AD解决了现有自动微分技术的关键问题，展现出在科学计算领域的大量潜力。

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

TL;DR: 引入了一种动态验证框架，用于提升医疗大模型在实际临床应用中的表现，并提出了新的Baichuan-M2模型，该模型在健康基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗大模型在静态测试（如USMLE）与实际临床决策中的表现存在显著差距，研究目标是解决传统考试无法捕捉医疗咨询动态性的难题。

Method: 提出了一种动态验证框架，包括患者模拟器（生成真实临床环境）和临床评分生成器（动态评估），并结合多阶段强化学习策略和改进的GRPO算法训练了Baichuan-M2模型。

Result: Baichuan-M2在HealthBench评估中超过所有开源模型和多数闭源模型，在HealthBench Hard基准上得分超过32，仅次于GPT-5。

Conclusion: 动态验证系统在对齐LLM与实际临床应用上的能力中至关重要，同时在医疗人工智能性能与参数权衡中建立了新的标杆。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模空间-时间联合尺度(ST尺度)的高阶依赖性上存在不足。

Method: 引入空间-时间金字塔建模模块提取多ST尺度特征，以及自适应超图建模模块并通过三阶段超图传播综合捕获空间-时间动态特性。

Result: 在六个真实MTS数据集上的实验表明，ST-Hyper在长期和短期预测中的MAE指标分别减少了3.8%和6.8%，表现优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: ST-Hyper有效建模MTS的多ST尺度高阶依赖性，性能卓越，具有广泛应用可能性。

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为VariAntNet的深度学习去中心化控制模型，用于增强灾害响应任务中的多机器人集群效率和任务执行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前灾害响应中，简单机器人集群由于感知和通信限制，难以在复杂环境中维持凝聚力和高效运作。

Method: VariAntNet使用几何特征提取、神经网络架构以及新颖的多目标损失函数，通过可见图Laplacian矩阵特性实现集群控制，并应用于有限感知范围的多机器人聚合任务。

Result: VariAntNet在多机器人聚合任务中的收敛速度和集群连接性显著优于现有解析方法，收敛速度提高了一倍以上。

Conclusion: VariAntNet在时间敏感的应急响应场景中证明了高效性与实用性，虽存在个别机器人损失，但相比传统方法具有更高的综合效率。

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

Result: 提出了一种统一视角，将校准视为预测模型与真实世界的无可区分性。

Conclusion: 校准可以用来量化预测模型与真实世界之间被分辨的难易程度，并对相关领域决策制定提供借鉴。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction（UDI）的新策略，通过放弃传统的联合损失，采取主动的、多步骤的训练方案来解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联合损失和动态加权策略虽能缓解模态不平衡问题，但本质上是事后纠偏，忽略了其竞争本质。

Method: 提出UDI策略，先训练锚点模态以收敛，再用无监督损失引导其他模态，并动态调整模态交互，使信息流动更加有效。

Result: 实验表明，相较于现有方法，UDI在解决模态不平衡方面表现更优，提高了多模态学习任务的性能。

Conclusion: UDI通过解耦模态优化及定向信息流动，规避了单一模态的主导，为多模态特征学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Result: 算法在高准确预测下接近离线最优，低准确预测下保证传统竞争比。

Conclusion: 框架适用于多种场景，体现在线决策方法的灵活性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Result: 在八个多变量数据集上测试，RDIT取得了较低的CRPS、更快的推断速度以及更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: RDIT提供了一个高效的时间序列预测框架，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法可用于设定模型训练的停止点，无需依赖验证数据集，同时在物理实验中的测量数据分析中也显示了高效性，有重要实际意义。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Method: 提出一种新的分页模型来优化专家管理，并分析确定性和随机算法的竞争比下界，随后开发了一种专门适配此模型的基于层的LRU扩展算法。

Result: 通过在合成数据集和实际使用MoE的LLMs中进行模拟验证，新算法表现出优于经典分页问题方法（如标准LRU）的性能优势。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实践中均显示出对LLM专家管理的优化潜力，为进一步改进缓存管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

*Bingcong Li,Yilang Zhang,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过方差抑制(VASSO)改进SAM算法以提高深度学习模型泛化能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM算法虽然通过考虑损失函数几何的锐度来增强模型的泛化能力，但存在‘过于友好的对手’问题，导致泛化效果受限。

Method: 引入VASSO方法，通过方差抑制来稳定对手行为，并将其与SAM算法整合，以在视觉和语言任务上改进泛化能力。

Result: 结合SAM与VASSO的数值验证表明，泛化能力得到提高，同时在某些场景下还具有所需的计算效率和泛化能力平衡。

Conclusion: VASSO方法在解决SAM算法过友好对手问题上表现突出，为深度学习模型的泛化能力提升提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于决策变压器的通知推荐系统，提高了推荐的时效性和相关性，并显著减少了用户疲劳感，在LinkedIn的应用中实现了会话次数增加0.72%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通知推荐系统需要在消息效用和用户疲劳之间找到平衡，同时处理高维推荐场景中的不稳定性、分布移位敏感性及可解释性难题。

Method: 采用基于决策变压器的框架，将策略学习重构为基于回报条件的监督学习，并设计了一种适用于非回合任务的多奖励机制和基于分位数回归的回报条件化方法，同时通过循环缓冲的序列处理实现高效实时推理。

Result: 基于LinkedIn的通知推荐系统的线下与线上实验表明，该方法可有效提高通知效用及用户会话活动，减少用户疲劳；与基于多目标的CQL方法相比，该系统增加了0.72%的会话次数。

Conclusion: 基于决策变压器的通知推荐框架在实际应用中表现出更强的鲁棒性、灵活性和可扩展性，有效改善了用户体验和推荐效果，具有实际生产环境中的可用性。

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过使用变分图自动编码器（VGAEs）生成合成配电网络，以解决能量网络中公共电力系统数据缺乏的问题，并公开其模型及分析，促进机器学习在电力系统中的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能量网络研究中缺乏公开的电力系统数据，严重制约了基于机器学习方法的研究发展，为此提出通过生成合成配电网络以弥补数据不足。

Method: 使用来自ENGAGE和DINGO的开源数据集，设计并比较了四种基于VGAE的解码器方案，通过结构与频谱指标分析生成网络与原始网络的匹配程度。

Result: 简单的解码器不能捕获现实的网络形态，基于GCN的方案在ENGAGE表现良好，但在更复杂的DINGO上会出现如断开成分等伪影问题。

Conclusion: 尽管VGAE在网络合成上展现潜力，但其在复杂性和生成质量方面仍有局限性，需要开发更加表达力强的生成模型及评估方法。

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出的SimpleTIR算法通过过滤无效回合，成功稳定了多回合工具交互推理训练，实现了数学推理的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的使用强化学习训练多回合工具交互推理模型存在训练不稳定性和性能崩溃问题，这种不稳定性主要是由于外部工具反馈引起的分布漂移。

Method: 提出了一种名为SimpleTIR的算法，作用于训练过程中，通过识别并过滤掉生成无效回合的路径，避免高幅梯度对训练的干扰，从而稳定学习动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，SimpleTIR在数学推理基准上达到了当前最先进的性能，例如将AIME24基准测试的分数从22.1提升至50.5。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR不仅解决了多回合工具交互推理训练的不稳定性，还在无需监督微调的情况下，鼓励模型发现多样且复杂的推理模式，如自我纠错和交叉验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Conclusion: HydroGAT模型不仅提升了洪水预测精度，还通过分布式数据并行有效解决了高分辨率下的训练效率问题，适用于流域尺度的实时预测与研究。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 研究展示了使用神经网络学习复杂ω-正则语言的可行性，表明其可作为神经符号验证方法的潜在组件。

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Result: 在Deepseek-VL2和MolmoE模型上测试，混合精度量化实现了较低内存需求，同时保持了与基准模型相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 混合精度量化是一种有效减少内存使用的技术，同时还能兼顾模型性能，为大语言与视觉模型的应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a

a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity

achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

Method: 采用神经缩放文献中的容量分配模型（Brill, 2024），分析特征流形如何影响SAEs的缩放行为。

Result: 研究再次确认了不同的缩放机制，并指出在某一机制下，特征流形可能导致SAEs学习到的特征少于系统的潜变量数。

Conclusion: 提出了关于SAEs在真实世界中是否进入这种病态机制的初步讨论，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

*Benjamin Doerr,Martin S. Krejca,Simon Wietheger*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了动态多目标遗传算法dNSGA-II，其特性是动态群体规模，通过理论分析证明了其在计算\textsc{OneMinMax}问题Pareto前沿方面比传统NSGA-II更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NSGA-II在处理多目标优化问题时，需要一个较大的固定群体规模以存储Pareto前沿，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 提出了基于NSGA-II的动态版本dNSGA-II，其初始群体规模为4，根据函数评估的次数逐步翻倍，最大规模为\mu，并通过数学运行时分析验证其性能。

Result: 对于选择合适的参数\mu和\tau，dNSGA-II对\textsc{OneMinMax}问题的运行时间为O(n log(n))，相比传统NSGA-II具备显著速度提升。此外，也验证了移除参数\tau（通过并发运行dNSGA-II）的可行性。

Conclusion: dNSGA-II在多目标优化问题上的性能优越，尤其在计算效率和算法运行时间方面显著优于经典NSGA-II。

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are among the most widely and
successfully applied optimizers for multi-objective problems. However, to store
many optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run
with a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the
algorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the
popular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts
with a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a
user-specified number $\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of
$\mu$. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove that the dNSGA-II with
parameters $\mu \geq 4(n + 1)$ and $\tau \geq \frac{256}{50} e n$ computes the
full Pareto front of the \textsc{OneMinMax} benchmark of size $n$ in
$O(\log(\mu) \tau + \mu \log(n))$ function evaluations, both in expectation and
with high probability. For an optimal choice of $\mu$ and $\tau$, the resulting
$O(n \log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic
NSGA-II by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter
$\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This
approach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\log(n))$ compared to an
optimal choice of $\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of
$\Theta(n / \log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.
