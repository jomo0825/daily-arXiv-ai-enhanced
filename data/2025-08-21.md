### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了一些正采样Kantorovich算子（SK算子）及其收敛性质，通过分析其局部和全局逼近性质，并研究了这些算子在理想条件和非理想条件下对各种图像特性参数的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SK算子等在图像处理中的逼近性质及不同算子对不同图像特性的适用性。

Method: 通过定义基本术语和逼近基本定理（FTA），结合误差分析、均方误差（MSE）、散斑指数（SI）、散斑抑制指数（SSI）、散斑平均保留指数（SMPI）和等效视图数（ENL），对SK算子、高斯算子等进行研究，并通过数值示例验证其特性。

Result: 数值分析表明，基于不同图像特性，不同的算子在特定条件下表现出不同的重要性，有的适用于某些特定图像特征，有的则不适用。

Conclusion: 文章通过数值例子和理论分析，表明不同的算子在图像逼近时各有优劣，适合用来处理非理想条件下的图像特性分析。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于联邦学习（FL）的姿态识别框架，以实现工业环境中隐私保护的人体动作识别（HAR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能制造环境中，为了提高生产力、安全性以及人机协作需求，需对工人的动作进行实时准确的识别；同时解决现有方法因数据集中化导致的隐私问题。

Method: 利用五名参与者采集的定制骨架数据集，结合改进版的FastPose模型；采用两种时间序列模型（LSTM和Transformer encoder），并在集中化、本地化、FL（联邦平均）和FL集成（FedEnsemble）四种模式下进行训练和评估。

Result: 在全局测试集中，采用FL的Transformer模型相比集中化训练的准确性提升了12.4个百分点，FedEnsemble方式提升了16.3个百分点。在外部未见过的客户端上，FL和FedEnsemble准确率分别超出集中化方法52.6和58.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架不仅能保护隐私，还能显著增强跨用户的泛化能力，适用于异构工业环境中的可扩展隐私保护型HAR。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

### [3] [LENS: Learning to Segment Anything with Unified Reinforced Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14153)
*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LENS的强化学习框架，用于在文本提示的图像分割任务中同时优化推理过程和分割表现，并在RefCOCO系列基准上实现了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时缺乏显式的链式推理能力，导致对未见过的提示或领域的泛化性能较差。

Method: 引入了一个可扩展的强化学习框架LENS，使用统一的奖励机制连接文本、框和分割区域级别信息，以优化推理与质量。具体基于Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct模型进行实验。

Result: 在RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, 和 RefCOCOg 基准上，LENS实现了平均cIoU为81.2%，超越了强大基准方法GLaMM最多5.6%。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习驱动的链式推理提升了文本提示分割模型的性能，并为构建泛化能力更强的分割模型提供了一条可行途径。

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at
https://github.com/hustvl/LENS.

Conclusion: RynnEC为具身智能代理提供细粒度物理世界感知能力，促进通用认知核心的发展，支持多样具身任务的泛化。

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

### [5] [Local Scale Equivariance with Latent Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14187)
*Md Ashiqur Rahman,Chiao-An Yang,Michael N. Cheng,Lim Jun Hao,Jeremiah Jiang,Teck-Yian Lim,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度平衡正则器(DEC)，以增强模型的局部尺度等变性，展示其在ImageNet基准上的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中因目标尺度变化引发的挑战，如同类目标尺度不同及相机距离对感知尺度的影响。

Method: 提出深度平衡正则器(DEC)，可集成至现有网络架构并适配预训练模型，用以提升局部尺度等变性。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提升了四个热门预训练深度网络（如ViT、DeiT、Swin、BEiT）的性能和局部尺度一致性。

Conclusion: DEC方法有效改善了模型对局部尺度变化的适应性，同时实现了性能提高，在计算机视觉任务中具有实际意义。

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

### [6] [CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197)
*Tinghan Yang,Md Ashiqur Rahman,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的模型CLIPSym，利用预训练的CLIP模型和旋转等变解码器来检测图像中的旋转和反射对称性，并证明其在对称性检测数据集上的表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性是计算机视觉中的重要几何线索，但其检测一直是一项挑战。通过探索CLIP等视觉-语言模型，研究是否能通过自然图像描述中的对称性线索提升检测能力。

Method: 提出了一种方法CLIPSym，结合CLIP的图像与语言编码器和基于Transformer与G卷积的旋转等变解码器。此外，设计了一种新颖的提示技术——Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping（SAPG），通过聚合多样化的对象提示更好融合语义信息。

Result: 实验证明CLIPSym在DENDI、SDRW和LDRS这三个对称性检测数据集上的表现超过了现有的最佳方法。同时通过消融实验验证了CLIP预训练、旋转等变解码器和SAPG技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CLIPSym结合视觉与语言模型的能力，成功实现了高效的对称性检测，展示了CLIP和创新提示技术在视觉任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at
https://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as
online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across
three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and
environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种结合图卷积网络（GCNs）和Voronoi图进行图像分类的新框架，通过将图像像素或区域视为图的顶点，构建Delaunay三角剖分来进行处理，显著提升分类准确率和预处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在利用GCNs处理复杂数据结构的能力，探索如何在复杂场景和精细类别的图像分类任务中提升性能，同时寻求优化GCN的效率。

Method: 提出了一种新的GCN版本，称为Normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN)，结合Voronoi图，以高效的方式将图像表示为图结构，用于图像分类任务。

Result: 该模型在多组基准数据集上显著提高了分类准确率，并减少了预处理时间，优于现有最先进模型，尤其是在复杂场景和精细分类任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合GCNs和Voronoi图的方法能够推进图像分类任务，同时展示了在计算机视觉和非结构化数据领域开发基于图学习新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过研究数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变 (DR) 分级模型中的符合性预测影响，发现样本混合策略（如Mixup和CutMix）能改善预测准确性并提供更可靠的预测不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变分级模型尽管正确率较高，但缺乏鲁棒的不确定性量化限制其临床应用。

Method: 研究了五种不同数据增强策略（无增强、几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix）对两种神经网络模型（ResNet-50和CoaT）的符合性预测指标的影响。

Result: 样本混合策略（如Mixup和CutMix）不仅提高预测准确性，还改进了不确定性估计，而CLAHE可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 提高AI系统的可信度需要结合数据增强策略与不确定性量化进行联合设计。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Conclusion: GALA能更高效地将2D图像解析为语言感知的3D场景表示，减少内存占用并支持多种查询方式。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出用于解释性目标识别的多解释基准测试和一个对比条件推理（CCI）框架，改进基于CLIP的视觉-语言模型的分类和解释质量，且无需训练即可获得最先进性能。

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的目标识别方法受限于其文本编码器，无法有效利用解释性结构，同时已有数据集的单一且噪声较大的解释方式无法充分展现图像的判别特征多样性。

Method: 提出一个多解释基准测试，包含每张图片的多种解释注释及相应评估指标；设计对比条件推理（CCI）框架，通过显式建模图像嵌入、类别标签与解释之间的概率关系，无需训练即可实现准确分类及多样化解释生成。

Result: 所提出的CCI框架在多解释基准上的表现达到当前最先进水平，显著提高分类准确性及解释质量，尤其在零样本场景下表现强劲。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅为理解性目标识别任务提供了更全面的评估框架，同时在任务性能上设立了新的基准，代码将公开以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

TL;DR: P2P0.1是一种基础模型，能够通过只依赖像素流游戏并在最低游戏特定工程的情况下，学会以人类行为玩多个3D视频游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足AI队友、可控NPC、个性化直播和辅助测试等新兴用户和开发者需求，要求模型通用且不依赖大量特定游戏调整。

Method: 采用端到端行为克隆训练，结合标注的人类游戏示范和通过逆动力学模型为公共视频推定动作。模型为解码器仅Transformer结构，支持大动作空间，同时GPU上低延迟。

Result: P2P0.1在Roblox和经典MS-DOS游戏中展示出基本的游戏能力，并验证了未标注数据对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为实现专家级文本调控游戏控制提出了后续扩展和评估步骤。

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 建立了一种新型的跨类别关系损失函数（ICR），用于改进小物体检测中的梯度更新问题，并提出了包含多场景和高质量标注的小型车辆多车牌数据集（SVMLP）。方法在YOLOv12-T和UAV-DETR模型中均提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有IoU损失对小物体梯度更新不足的问题，充分利用跨类别空间关系以提高检测性能。

Method: 提出跨类别关系损失（ICR），通过空间关系惩罚机制改进小物体的梯度学习；此外，构建了多场景小型车辆多车牌数据集（SVMLP）。

Result: 在YOLOv12-T和UAV-DETR模型中分别实现了10.3%和1.6%的mAP$^{test}_{50}$提升，无需额外的超参数调节。

Conclusion: ICR损失可以轻松结合现有IoU基础损失，显著提升小物体检测性能，并通过新数据集的应用进一步验证该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前检测Taxol对细胞响应的现有方法较为昂贵、耗时且不适合高通量或实时分析，缺乏公开数据集用于自动化形态分析。

Method: 引入一个新显微镜图像数据集，并提出一种名为ResAttention-KNN的基线模型，结合ResNet-50和注意力模块进行细胞形态分类，同时运用k近邻分类器提高鲁棒性与可解释性。

Result: 所提出的数据集与模型实现被公开，支持未来可重复性研究，并且有效分类处理了Taxol浓度的不同处理。

Conclusion: 该研究为Taxol浓度分类建立了新的基线标准，并为视觉驱动的生物医学分析提供了支持。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

TL;DR: HRC-Pose通过对6D位姿的连续性进行对比学习，以改进类别级物体位姿估计在深度信息输入下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能明确捕捉物体6D位姿的连续性，导致预测不一致和对未知位姿的泛化能力下降。

Method: 提出一个深度信息的HRC-Pose框架，利用对比学习来学习点云表示以保留6D位姿连续性，并通过6D位姿感知的分层排名机制进行多任务、多类别的对比学习。还设计了单独处理旋转与平移表示的位姿估计模块。

Result: 实验表明，HRC-Pose有效学习了连续特征空间，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准数据集上稳超现有方法，并支持实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose方法有助于改进物体位姿估计的准确性和稳定性，展示了现实应用的潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的情感可控说话面容生成需要克服多模态关系建模和保持身份一致性的挑战。

Method: 通过音视频的分离、视觉标记量化引入情感锚点(EA)表征，并利用自回归变换器建模视觉标记全局分布。

Result: 实验在MEAD数据集上验证，方法在多种情感音频的条件下表现出优越的生成效果。

Conclusion: 提出的情感可控生成方法在质量和定量指标上均表现出较好效果，为该领域提供了新技术支持。

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 当前的多目标跟踪（MOT）系统主要针对行人跟踪设计，难以泛化至其他类别目标。本文旨在设计一个更加通用且在复杂交通状况中表现优异的跟踪框架。

Method: 提出了遮挡感知的重新识别机制来改善重度遮挡情况下的身份保持，同时通过利用道路语义信息（如车道方向、人行横道、道路边界）提出道路结构感知的轨迹优化策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在新数据集和多个公共基准测试上表现出色，并在传统的行人跟踪基准（如MOT17和MOT20测试集）上分别取得了66.4和65.7的HOTA分数。

Conclusion: 该方法可不仅用于多类别目标的通用跟踪任务，还在传统行人多目标跟踪基准上实现较强表现，显示出其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Conclusion: TCFNet有效解决了面骨点云变换的挑战，为正颌手术模拟提供了更高效精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Conclusion: QuadINR在高效硬件实现中展现出显著优势，同时在信号表示性能上超越现有方法，具有很大的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by
up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为高效、准确的高分辨率ST建模提供了一种新方法，为下一代ST技术发展奠定了基础。代码已公开提供。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CTA-Flux方法，通过利用MMDiT技术，解决了Flux模型处理中文文本生成图像时的语义理解问题，大幅提高中文文本图像生成的质量和文化真实性，同时保留与现有插件兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Flux模型主要基于英语语料训练，在处理中文等非英语文本生成图像时遇到了语言和文化偏差的问题。现有的翻译或双语模型微调方法对于处理特定的文化语义不足。

Method: 引入CTA-Flux，该方法通过使用MMDiT技术直接控制Flux模型主干，在减少参数规模的同时增强中文语义理解，并兼容当前的图像生成插件。

Result: CTA-Flux在中文和英文文本提示下实现了卓越的图像生成质量，高度逼真的视觉效果及精准的中文语义表达。

Conclusion: CTA-Flux方法有效改进了中文文本图像生成的质量及文化真实性，而无需对整个模型进行大量的重新训练，兼具高性能与现有生态兼容性。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于摄像头的屏幕捕捉会因为相机的彩色滤波器和显示屏的像素排列频率混叠产生摩尔纹，严重影响图像质量。现有去摩尔纹方法存在局限性，包括空间变化的伪影强度、大规模结构、通道依赖性以及帧间快速波动等问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD

*Bing Han,Yuhua Huang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的单目3D人体姿态估计方法HyperDiff，结合扩散模型和HyperGCN，用于解决深度歧义和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D人体姿态估计在2D到3D转换中常遭遇深度歧义和遮挡问题，传统方法容易忽略多尺度骨架特征，对精度造成负面影响。

Method: 采用扩散模型捕捉数据的不确定性，同时用HyperGCN作为去噪器建模关节间的高阶相关性，以提升复杂姿态下的去噪能力。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到了最新的性能表现，且在性能与效率间实现了灵活平衡。

Conclusion: HyperDiff方法解决了传统单目姿态估计的挑战，并表现出优异性能及适应性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FOCUS方法，使用一种基于频率的条件扩散框架解决模型在域适应中的遗忘问题，增强了语义分割和单目深度估计的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本论文旨在解决测试时适应中存在的域迁移和任务相关知识保持之间的平衡难题，避免适应域迁移过程中对任务关键知识的遗忘。

Method: 提出了FOCUS，一种基于频率的条件扩散方法，通过轻量化的Y形频率预测网络（Y-FPN）预测噪声图像的高低频信息，实现扩散驱动去噪过程中的任务相关语义信息保持，并采用FrequencyMix进行数据增强，增强对多种扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 通过在语义分割和单目深度估计任务上测试，使用15类扰动类型和三个数据集，FOCUS在平均性能上达到了最新的最优。此外，FOCUS还能辅助现有模型的适应方法，通过FOCUS去噪图像派生伪标签提供额外监督，即使在有限间歇监督的情况下，也能够减轻灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: FOCUS不仅提升了模型在域适应任务上的独立性能，还能为现有适应方法提供有力补充，为测试时适应领域的研究提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文生图扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在多主体合成及精确空间控制上仍面临挑战。研究希望同时解决空间精度和身份保持问题。

Method: 采用MUSE框架，利用串联交叉注意(CCA)机制扩展语义空间，实现布局和文本指导的协调匹配，设计渐进式双阶段训练策略以分解任务优化目标。

Result: 实验显示，MUSE在零样本输入下实现了优越的空间精度和身份一致性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MUSE模型有效推进了可控图像合成领域，代码和模型已在GitHub提供。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: 3DGS在农业中的应用面临光照不均、遮挡和视野受限等独特挑战，因此需要开发新的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出了基于NIRPlant数据集的NIRSplat架构，将NIR、RGB以及文本元数据等结合，通过跨注意力机制和3D点位位置编码增强几何先验。

Result: 实验表明，NIRSplat在农业复杂场景中的表现优于3DGS、CoR-GS与InstantSplat等方法。

Conclusion: NIRSplat结合多模态数据显著提高了农业场景3D重建的效果，相关代码与数据集已公开。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Motivation: 高泛化性和准确参与度估计对于人机交互系统至关重要，但现存方法在多领域中效果不佳，且难以捕捉复杂的交互动态。

Method: 引入领域提示机制，以可学习向量为输入添加前缀，显式引导模型进行领域感知适应；并采用并行交叉注意模块对交互参与者的反应和预期状态进行对齐。

Result: DAPA框架在多个跨文化、跨语言基准数据集上均达到最新性能，并在NoXi-J测试集上的一致性相关系数上实现了0.45的绝对提升。此外，还获得了MultiMediate'25 多域参与度估计挑战赛第一名。

Conclusion: DAPA方法证明了其在领域自适应和交互参与估计中的优越性，为通用可推广的交互建模提供了一种新方向。

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

Motivation: 解决当前基于音频驱动的3D说话人面孔合成方法在少量训练数据情况下因音频中干扰信息导致的唇部行为不真实和图像质量差问题。

Method: 使用静态3D高斯属性场，通过解耦音频和面部输入信号控制两种独立变形场，并引入相似性对比损失函数优化预训练效果，同时整合粗到细模块提升渲染图像质量。

Conclusion: D^3-Talker在3D说话人脸合成领域，打破了需长时间视频训练的局限，提供了一种更高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各种场景中都获得了当前最佳效果，同时推断速度远快于其他基于扩散的模型。

Conclusion: Ouroboros不仅能提升正逆渲染性能，还可无训练地转移到视频分解中，减少视频序列的时间一致性问题，同时保持每帧的高质量渲染。

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Motivation: 随着视频生成技术的发展，对定制化视频编辑的需求日益增长，尤其是主体替换这一领域却未被充分探索。

Method: 框架基于掩码引导和用户提供的参考图像，采用多条件输入及条件融合模块，同时配合自适应掩码策略和两阶段数据集构造与训练机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，DreamSwapV在VBench指标和新提出的DreamSwapV-Benchmark上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DreamSwapV框架实现了更高质量的主体替换，其策略设计和性能优于当前主流方法。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Conclusion: 本文方法提供了一种有效的预测未来6D头部轨迹的框架，同时创建的数据集对研究真实世界导航问题具有重要意义。

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen
environments. Check out our project webpage at

Conclusion: Vivid-VR在视频恢复领域实现了现有方法的优越性能，为相关领域提供了公开的代码与检查点。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本生成图像模型虽然在写实渲染上表现出色，但在复杂提示词对布局和对象关系的捕捉上还有局限，因此提出SATURN以解决这些问题。

Method: SATURN基于VAR-CLIP，通过将场景图转化为一个强调顺序的令牌序列，同时利用冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干网络解释图结构，仅对VAR变换器进行微调。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，FID从56.45%降低到21.62%，Inception得分从16.03提高到24.78，超越了SG2IM和SGDiff等方法，同时优化了对象数量与空间关系的准确性。

Conclusion: SATURN成功整合了场景结构感知能力与前沿自回归架构的高保真生成能力，简化了模型结构并提升了性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

Conclusion: PB-IAD有效解决了工业环境中因数据稀缺和动态需求带来的挑战，为用户提供了高性能且灵活的异常检测能力。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

### [42] [WISE-FUSE: Efficient Whole Slide Image Encoding via Coarse-to-Fine Patch Selection with VLM and LLM Knowledge Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14537)
*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WISE-FUSE，一种适用于计算病理学的自适应WSI编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域显著减少处理时间，同时保持或提高诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WSI编码方法需要处理大量高分辨率数据，导致时间和计算成本过高，成为实际应用的瓶颈。

Method: 提出WISE-FUSE框架，通过病理领域视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，利用知识蒸馏机制计算低分辨率补丁与文本描述之间的相似性，从而筛选出最有信息的区域进行高分辨率编码，并与文本嵌入结合。

Result: WISE-FUSE在显著减少WSI编码时间（超过三倍）的同时，诊断性能与传统方法持平或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算病理学领域提供了一种可扩展、实用的解决方案，在保持诊断性能的前提下，大幅提高了编码效率。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过利用文档中字符形状的冗余性，来纠正OCR系统的输出误差并改进字符聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OCR系统在识别低质量数据时存在困难，尤其对于打印文档，由于其域内数据变异性低但域间数据变异性高，现有方法未能充分利用文档冗余性来提升性能。

Method: 引入了一种扩展高斯混合模型，通过交替使用期望-最大化算法、子类重新对齐过程和统计正态性检验，优化OCR结果。

Result: 在多级退化文档上测试，包括乌拉圭军事档案和17世纪到20世纪中期的欧洲报纸，显示了性能改进。

Conclusion: 利用文档中字符形状的内在冗余性可以改善OCR系统的性能，特别是在低质量文档识别场景中。

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进基于离散姿势代码的可控运动生成技术的表现，特别是捕捉细粒度运动细节的能力，增强表达能力和可控性。

Method: 提出一种方法，结合了离散姿势代码表示与连续运动特征，通过残差矢量量化(RVQ)增强运动细节表达，同时保持姿势代码的可解释性和可操控性。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，模型的Frechet生成距离(FID)从0.041降低至0.015，Top-1 R精度从0.508略微提高到0.510，并通过姿势代码方向相似性的定性分析验证了运动编辑的可控性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法成功提升了模型生成与编辑细微运动细节的能力，同时保持良好的可控性和表达能力，验证了其有效性和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

TL;DR: 提出了Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM)，旨在确保概念的准确空间定位，改善了无标注的概念瓶颈模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标注概念瓶颈模型未能准确地定位概念到相关区域，需要一种方法改善这一问题。

Method: 提出Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM)，结合基础模型的信息和原型学习，每个概念分配一个原型并通过其学习准确定位。

Result: 实验结果表明，LCBM能够有效识别图像中存在的概念，定位表现显著改善，分类性能保持不变。

Conclusion: LCBM框架具备优异的概念定位能力，同时实现了良好的分类性能，可为无标注概念瓶颈模型的进一步发展提供借鉴。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

TL;DR: 提出GOGS，一个基于2D高斯曲面的两阶段框架，显著提升光亮物体的逆渲染性能，同时兼具高效性和逼真性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有逆渲染方法在镜面反射、多视角一致性和复杂材质分解上的局限性。

Method: 提出基于物理渲染和几何建模的两阶段方法，在第一阶段通过分离求和近似和几何先验实现表面重建，在第二阶段利用蒙特卡洛采样完整渲染方程，对间接光照和高频细节进行高斯路径追踪和方向编码。

Result: 实验表明，GOGS在几何重建、材质分离以及新光源下的重光照质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOGS显著改善了逆渲染的效率和精确性，为光亮物体的几何建模和材质估计提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety
of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be
understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We
present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of
real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全片图像（WSI）的超高分辨率和密集监督信号的稀缺，MIL任务需要大规模和多样化的数据集，而现有增强方法在效率和语义控制上存在不足。

Method: HistAug是一种基于潜在空间的生成模型，通过条件约束实现显式补丁级别的变换（如色调、腐蚀），可以在单次前向传递中高效地处理大量补丁，同时保持语义信息。

Result: 在多种片级任务和不同器官数据上，实验结果表明HistAug在低数据情况下表现优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证了学习型变换和全WSI一致增强的优势。

Conclusion: HistAug显著提高了MIL任务的性能，特别是在数据较少的情境下，为可控数据增强提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为监控、工业安全及自主监控中的早期火灾检测提供了一种可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Conclusion: 视觉提示方法在增量目标检测中有潜力，但需结合数据重放以提升表现，为未来相关研究提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点云视频在捕获动态3D运动时表现优异，但其时空无序性导致直接再序列化建模的困难。需要一种能够有效处理该无序性并提升序列建模能力的方法。

Method: 通过提出统一时空状态空间模型（UST-SSM），本文在点云视频中引入了空间-时间选择扫描（STSS）以重新组织点的时序序列，同时通过时空结构聚合（STSA）补充细节，并通过时间交互采样（TIS）增强时间依赖。

Result: 实验结果在MSR-Action3D、NTU RGB+D以及Synthia 4D数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文方法能够显著提升动态3D动作识别的效果。

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is

Result: 在BEE24、MOT17、MOT20、DanceTrack等多个数据集上，与现有ANN方法在多目标跟踪上表现相当。

Conclusion: SMTrack提供了鲁棒且准确的基于SNN的跟踪方法，推进了SNN在复杂视觉任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Motivation: 现有长视频编辑方法在保持整体一致性和时间连贯性方面表现不足，尤其是在处理分钟级长序列时易出现结构漂移或时间伪影。

Method: 提出 AnchorSync，采用扩散框架将任务分解为稀疏的锚点帧编辑和平滑中间帧插值，使用渐进去噪技术和多模态引导分别确保结构一致性和时间动态性。

Result: 实验显著表明 AnchorSync 在长视频编辑中的连贯性和视觉效果优于前沿方法。

Conclusion: AnchorSync 有效解决了长视频编辑中全局与时间一致性问题，实现了高质量、稳定的编辑效果。

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

TL;DR: 提出了PerSense和PerSense++框架，通过实例检测和点提示优化模块解决密集图像下的个性化实例分割任务，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集视觉场景中的遮挡、背景混乱和尺度变化问题，实现个性化实例分割。

Method: 设计了PerSense框架，包括实例检测模块（IDM）和点提示选择模块（PPSM），以及增强版PerSense++，加入了多样性选择、混合实例检测和无关掩膜过滤等改进组件。

Result: PerSense++在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PerSense和PerSense++框架在密集图像个性化实例分割中的任务表现卓越，为这一任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

*Gopi Raju Matta,Trisha Reddypalli,Vemunuri Divya Madhuri,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GeMS的3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）框架，能够从极度模糊的图像中直接重建场景，并在模拟和真实数据集上实现了最新的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的去模糊方法和基于GS的方法依赖于清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在处理极端模糊图像时并不现实，需要一种能够直接从严重模糊图像进行3D重建的框架。

Method: GeMS框架包括：（1）基于深度学习的VGGSfM模块，从模糊图像直接估计姿态和生成点云；（2）3DGS-MCMC模块，通过将高斯分布视为概率分布样本，实现稳健的场景初始化；（3）联合优化相机轨迹和高斯参数以增强重建稳健性。此外，GeMS-E版本整合了基于事件的双重积分去模糊步骤（EDI），进一步改善了姿态估计和点云生成的精度。

Result: GeMS和GeMS-E在合成和真实数据集上均实现了最先进的性能，可以直接从极度模糊的输入中恢复3D场景。

Conclusion: 这是首个直接从严重模糊图像处理极端运动模糊问题的3DGS框架，为模糊输入条件下的3D场景重建提供了全新解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新方法，通过整合多种现有的预训练教师模型，训练高效的视觉基础模型(VFM)，无需依赖大量标注数据，性能优于现有数据驱动模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的VFM方法依赖大规模高质量标注数据和高端计算资源，但许多机构难以获得这种条件。提出新的方法，利用已存在的领域特定模型构建通用的VFM。

Method: 通过联合知识转移与保留的方法，将多种预训练教师模型在共享的潜在空间中统一起来，以缓解分布差异导致的不平衡转移问题。此外，采用知识保留策略，通过适配器模块将通用教师作为知识基础，整合其它特定任务教师的知识。

Result: 实验表明，该VFM在图像分类、目标检测、语义分割和实例分割等四项核心视觉任务上性能优异，优于现有的基于数据驱动的方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种无需依赖大规模标注数据的方法，以有效整合现有模型的知识，构建了一种通用性的视觉基础模型，为未来视觉任务应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GSFix3D框架，通过将扩散模型的先验知识融入3D表示中解决新视点渲染质量问题，特别是对未观察到或极端视角区域进行了视图修复，并在多个基准测试上实现了SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯点进一步视图合成技术在应对极端新视点和部分观察区域高质量渲染方面存在局限性。同时，虽然扩散模型生成能力强，但由于依赖文本提示且缺乏特定场景信息，难以应用于精确3D重建。

Method: 提出了GSFix3D框架，核心为GSFixer，一个经过定制微调协议训练的潜扩散模型，可以利用网格和3D高斯点，从而适配被预训练生成模型不同方法生成的多种环境和工件类型；同时设计了随机掩膜增强策略用于填补缺失区域。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，GSFix3D和GSFixer都表现出SOTA性能，仅需要对捕获数据进行最小的场景特定微调，且在真实测试中对位姿错误具有较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D在未观察区域和极端视角的修复中表现卓越，通过整合扩散模型与3D表示技术，提供了一种高度灵活和鲁棒的3D视觉解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，需检测未知目标和处理陌生驾驶场景，而现有方法多依赖已知类别，大语言模型在像素级输出上的计算成本高。

Method: 设计了一种端到端训练的视频变换器，采用多阶段多尺度查询记忆解码和比例随机丢弃技术，无需光流即可实现高精度分割，同时保留多尺度高分辨率空间时间特征。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了第一个专门针对光照和传感器映射的RAW图像数据集，并开发了一种轻量级神经网络来处理该问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像捕获过程复杂，受传感器和光照特性影响，创建多传感器和多光照条件数据集十分困难，因此需要高效的方法进行光照增强和传感器间映射。

Method: 提出并利用第一个针对不同光照和传感器映射的RAW图像数据集，采用自定义光箱捕获不同光照条件下的图像，并开发了一种轻量级神经网络来实现光照增强及传感器映射。

Result: 该方法能够在多个光照和传感器条件下实现优异的RAW图像映射性能，在下游神经ISP（图像信号处理）任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文提出的数据集与方法解决了RAW图像数据捕获上的挑战，并为光照增强和传感器映射提供了高效解决方案，在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合单目RGB图像与自动识别系统(AIS)数据生成海洋船舶6D位姿估计数据集的新技术，通过结合YOLOX-X检测出的船舶及AIS信息生成3D边界框和6D位姿，并验证了其高精度和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仅依赖AIS数据在位置提取上的局限性，例如设备可靠性问题、数据操控及传输延迟等。

Method: 使用YOLOX-X模型进行单目RGB图像船舶检测，并融合AIS数据生成6D位姿。通过比较两种数据转换方法（单应性和PnP方法），验证了其有效性。此外构建了BONK-pose公开数据集。

Result: 研究表明，Perspective-n-Point (PnP)方法相比单应性变换方法显著降低了投影误差，YOLOX-X模型针对相关船舶类别在IoU=0.5下的mAP达到了0.80。其方法无需人工标注即可生成6D位姿数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的6D位姿数据生成方法有效且优于传统方法，并推出了公开数据集BONK-pose。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种结合事件相机和传统RGB相机优势的方法，用于解决对象在高速运动场景中的6-DoF姿态跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目标在高速运动场景中，由于传统相机帧率限制和运动模糊所导致的定位和姿态跟踪困难问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于事件相机的光流算法，用于目标运动测量，并结合低频全局姿态估计器，实现6-DoF速度跟踪和姿态融合。

Result: 在仿真和实际数据上验证了算法的效果，尤其在高速运动情况下展现了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 结合事件相机和RGB相机的优势，可以有效地进行高速运动目标的6-DoF姿态跟踪。

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Motivation: 由于不同医院的扫描硬件及预处理方式差异，病理图像存在显著差异，PFMs可能会无意中学到医院特定特征，从而带来临床应用风险。

Method: 构建领域偏差定量评估流程，设计轻量对抗框架，通过可训练适配器和梯度反转层（GRL）连接的域分类器，从冻结特征表示中移除医院特定特征，而不修改编码器。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了领域（医院）偏差，其可视化分析和医院检测进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Motivation: 当前车牌识别在低分辨率、运动模糊和眩光等情况下效果不佳，现有生成模型也常因预训练依赖导致失真和伪影。

Method: 提出了MF-LPR$^2$，利用多帧对齐和聚合策略，提高低质量图像的清晰度和识别准确率，并设计了光流估算校正算法以优化对齐。

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS等指标上均优显著优于现有模型，识别准确率达86.44%，较单帧LPR高出72.4%，较多帧LPR高出3.89%。

Conclusion: MF-LPR$^2$能够有效恢复低质量车牌图像并提高识别精度，同时新构建的RLPR数据集验证了该框架的实际应用价值。

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有学习型医学图像配准方法对大量训练数据的依赖，推动临床应用。

Method: 利用冻结的DINOv3编码器，在测试时优化特征空间中的变形场，无需额外训练步骤。

Result: 在Abdomen MR-CT数据集上取得了最优的平均Dice得分(0.790)、最低的Hausdorff距离(4.9±5.0)和Log-Jacobian标准差(0.08±0.02)。在ACDC心脏MRI数据集上Dice得分提高至0.769，同时各项指标均优于初始对齐结果。

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间中操作，为无需额外训练的临床医学图像配准提供了一种实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对现有方法需要大量场景优化以确保多视图一致性的问题，开发实现鲁棒多视图一致编辑的新方法。

Method: 创建了一个大规模多视图编辑数据集和数据管道，框架包括：多视图引用编辑器和任意视图至视频合成器，利用预训练扩散模型的潜在3D感知能力。

Conclusion: Tinker迈向大规模、零样本3D编辑的关键一步，通过简单输入实现高质量、多视图一致的编辑，推动了3D编辑研究的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

Result: 该方法在四个基准数据集上优于现有方法，并通过推理流程在MSR-VTT和DiDeMo数据集上的Recall@1分别提升了2.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: 新方法在无需额外预训练的情况下，显著提高了视频-文本检索性能，表明细粒度信息和推理流程的有效性。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

*Zongming Li,Lianghui Zhu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransLight是一种新颖框架，可实现高保真和高自由度的光效迁移，解决了现有方法无法同时提供个性化控制和保留内容完整性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法缺乏个性化控制以及对内容完整性的有效保留，难以满足复杂光效迁移的实际需求。

Method: 提出生成解耦策略，利用两个扩散模型分离内容和光效，并构建包含百万条记录的数据集；通过IC-Light生成模型和新增条件信号进行训练，实现自定义自然的光效迁移。

Result: 实验表明，TransLight能成功实现跨图像的光效迁移，比现有技术提供更高的个性化光照控制。

Conclusion: TransLight开创了光效谐调与编辑的新研究方向，为实现灵活光照控制提供了新的可能性及方法。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EventSSEG，一种利用事件相机进行自监督学习的道路分割方法，克服了传统摄像头在低延迟和低计算解决方案上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶领域，道路分割是关键问题，而传统基于帧的相机面临低延迟和低计算能力挑战。事件相机提供了一种低功耗的解决方案，但其标签数据稀缺，限制了模型性能发挥。

Method: 提出了一种基于事件的自监督学习方法，结合事件相机的特性，使用概率注意力机制进行道路分割，不需大量的人工标注数据。

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上实验表明，EventSSEG在使用极少量标注事件的情况下，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EventSSEG方法充分利用了事件相机的潜力，可在有限标注数据情况下高效实现道路分割，为低功耗环境中的应用提供可能性。

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Motivation: 探讨胰腺形态随年龄变化的规律，并检测2型糖尿病对胰腺形态的潜在影响。

Method: 利用自动分割技术，对2533例患者的腹部CT和MRI图像进行分析，重采样至3mm等距分辨率，提取13项胰腺形态特征，并通过GAMLSS回归模型分析年龄趋势及糖尿病相关偏差。

Result: 调整混杂变量后，13个胰腺形态特征中有10个在2型糖尿病患者与非糖尿病对照组之间差异显著（p<0.05）。MRI和CT测量结果存在方法性差异。

Conclusion: 2型糖尿病患者的胰腺较对照组更小，研究提供了一套大规模非糖尿病人群的胰腺形态参考，并强调MRI与CT测量差异。

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

TL;DR: 提出了MS-CLR框架，通过对多种骨架约定的对齐学习，从而增强骨架动作识别的鲁棒性和泛化能力，在NTU RGB+D 60与120数据集上取得了最新的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的骨架动作识别方法仅依赖于单一骨架结构，不利于在多样化数据集上推广。

Method: 通过提出MS-CLR框架，将来自同一动作序列的多种骨架形式对齐学习，并采用ST-GCN框架适配不同的骨架结构与尺度。

Result: MS-CLR在NTU RGB+D 60与120数据集上性能超过现有的强对比学习基线，多骨架集成实现新的领域最佳结果。

Conclusion: MS-CLR通过多骨架对齐与结构不变性学习，能够捕获更多解剖学信息，提高特征的表达与泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Motivation: 当前的方法通常将几何重建和运动估计分开，这种分离限制了复杂多部件关节对象的扩展性。

Method: 引入基于关节化3D高斯的统一表示方法，以同时建模几何与运动，从而提高运动分解的鲁棒性和扩展性。

Result: 在MPArt-90基准测试中，该方法在部件级几何重建和运动估计中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，支持多类型对象。

Conclusion: 统一的关节化表示方法不仅提高了复杂对象的建模能力，还为机器人模拟和人机场景交互等下游任务提供了实用性与拓展潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在生成叙述性故事的同时保持与图像序列的语义联系，并简化训练流程和提升模型可重用性。

Method: 将视觉与语言模型用于图像描述生成，然后通过语言模型将这些描述转化为叙述性故事，同时提出新的评价指标ideality。

Result: 证明语言描述与叙述整合可以提高生成故事的质量，并实现更快的训练和高效重用性。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效平衡了图像关联性和叙述性，提出的ideality为人类仿真提供新工具。

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

Motivation: 旨在通过具有副词功能块的视角，揭示英汉新闻语序差异，促进对信息结构对比研究的深入理解。

Method: 使用大语言模型标注的英汉新闻平行语料库，从功能块位置和分布模式分析其语序特征。

Result: 发现：(1) 英语新闻核心信息先行、功能块多后置；中文新闻先背景后主体、功能块多前置；(2) SVO结构中，中文前置倾向更显著；(3) 功能块共现时，语序调整具有高度灵活性，受信息和语用目的驱动。

Conclusion: 单词语序既有系统偏好也有动态适应性，为英汉信息结构对比研究提供了新实证支持。

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of

this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

Result: 实验结果显示上述四种方法可以将数据泄露降至0%，同时保持94.7%的模型原始效用。

Conclusion: 多层次隐私保护框架能够有效降低隐私泄露风险，平衡隐私保护与模型效用之间的关系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

Motivation: 目前对LLMs如何处理输入成分（如标点符号、条件句等）的理解还有不足，研究其内部机制有助于提升可解释性。

Method: 使用基于干预的技术，通过评估标点符号在GPT-2、DeepSeek 和 Gemma 中的必要性和充分性，并进行互换干预与层级交换实验。

Result: 在GPT-2中，标点符号在多个层次上既必要又充分，而在DeepSeek较少成立，在Gemma中则完全不成立；条件语句和全称量化因素的处理差异明显。

Conclusion: 这些研究结果揭示了LLMs内部有关标点符号及推理规则处理的新机制，对模型解释性研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

Motivation: 扩散型大语言模型因模型规模大和计算成本高，部署受限。而现有的后训练量化方法在应用于DLLM时性能显著下降。

Method: 提出DLLMQuant框架，包含三种新技术：1）时间掩码自适应采样（TMAS），用于捕捉时序和掩码因素的分布；2）交互感知激活量化（IA-AQ），基于双向注意的交互信号动态分配量化资源；3）基于确定性的量化（CGQ），利用掩码状态和token分数进行误差补偿。

Result: 实验验证了DLLMQuant在性能和效率上的显著提升效果。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant有效解决了DLLM在后训练量化中的性能瓶颈，推动了非自回归文本生成技术的实际应用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种用于扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的高效文本生成方法，名为Diffusion Scratchpad（DPad），通过减少冗余并优化注意力计算速度，显著提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs在并行文本生成中效率较低，因需要在每一步预测所有后续未知的词元但仅保留部分结果，导致计算成本高企。

Method: 提出Diffusion Scratchpad方法，通过滑动窗口保留固定长度的后缀窗口，以及距离衰减丢弃机制去除远距离后缀词元，从而优化计算效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，DPad能在保持精准度的前提下，相比原始方法实现高达61.4倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: DPad是一种高效、可扩展、且训练免疫的dLLM优化方案，能显著提升长序列文本生成性能，展示了极大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### [84] [Comparing energy consumption and accuracy in text classification inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14170)
*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究关注大语言模型(LLMs)推理阶段的能耗问题，评估模型准确性与能效之间的权衡关系，并提供实践建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型广泛应用引发能效与可持续性担忧，特别是在推理阶段，这一环节的能耗研究较少，因此需要评估其能效表现。

Method: 系统性地比较不同模型架构和硬件配置在文本分类推理中的准确性与能耗，分析其中的平衡关系。

Result: 显示准确性最好的模型也可以具备能效优势，但较大的模型一方面能耗更高，另一方面准确性相对较低；推理能耗和运行时间之间关系紧密，可用执行时间作为能耗估算指标。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理阶段能耗的重要性，为研究者和实践者提供了平衡性能与能效的参考，助力可持续AI发展。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究介绍了一个称为Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG) 的任务，评估大模型生成研究论文引言的能力，并基于多个指标对五种模型进行了测评。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着研究者越来越多地采用大模型（LLMs）作为写作助手，生成高质量的研究论文引言变得既具有挑战性又极其重要。

Method: 提出SciIG任务，结合使用来自NAACL 2025和ICLR 2025的新数据集，对五种最新的大模型（包含开源和闭源模型）进行基于自动度量和人评的综合评估框架测试。

Result: 发现LLaMA-4 Maverick在多数指标上表现出色，尤其是在语义相似性与事实性方面；另外，三次提示模型比少次提示效果更优。

Conclusion: 结果为使用LLMs协助学术写作提供了实用见解，并提出了合理的预期，同时将公开所有代码和数据集以促进重现性和未来研究。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

*Cliff O'Reilly,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将LLMs与形式化知识表示和推理相结合，通过稀疏自动编码器计算概念激活，跨语言平均后得出概念表征，用于校验本体类之间的真实关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在语义表示中仍然掺杂了句法和语言特定信息，限制了其在知识推理中的能力。

Method: 提出一种通过稀疏自动编码器计算概念激活，并对不同语言版本的激活进行平均，以分离概念语义的技术。

Result: 实验表明，多语言平均的概念表征比单一语言更能反映本体类之间的真实关系。

Conclusion: 这一方法展示了基于多语言处理提高内部网络状态的机制性解释能力的潜力。

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRILE基准，共包含1,151道多项选择题，用于测试大型语言模型在低资源语言教育中的能力。研究表明，大多数模型的准确率低于65%，且存在解释缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探索大型语言模型在低资源语言环境中的教育价值，尤其关注其回答准确性与解释的语言学准确性。

Method: 基于罗马尼亚高风险考试题目，构建GRILE基准测试，用以分析多语言与罗马尼亚语言专属LLMs的表现；同时结合专家评审对模型解释进行评估。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro模型达到83%的准确率，但大多数开源模型准确率低于65%，且其48%的解释存在缺陷；暴露了模型在形态学和正字法规则上的弱点。

Conclusion: GRILE成为低资源语言教育中可控解释生成与评估的新测试平台，并揭示了发展可信赖教育NLP的开放挑战。

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

*M. Ali Bayram,Ali Arda Fincan,Ahmet Semih Gümüş,Sercan Karakaş,Banu Diri,Savaş Yıldırım,Demircan Çelik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合分词框架，结合规则驱动的形态分析与统计子词切分，提升了自然语言处理中的分词效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法（如BPE和WordPiece）在处理形态复杂和黏着语时表现有限，因为它们更多依赖词频而非语言学结构。

Method: 提出一种混合分词框架，包括语音规范化、词根-词缀词典、兼顾语素保留和词汇效率的新算法，并引入特殊符号以处理空格和大小写。此外，集成BPE来覆盖未登录词，但保持形态一致性。

Result: 在TR-MMLU基准测试中，该分词器取得了最高的土耳其语令牌比例（90.29%）和纯令牌比例（85.8%），并在对比实验中展示出更具语言意义的分词结果。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然以土耳其语为例进行验证，但其框架具有语言无关性，可以适配其他语言，为多语种自然语言处理系统提供了更具解释性和有效性的分词方案。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决形态和句法分析的新型任务需求，提出一种统一的多任务模型，提高多语言解析能力。

Method: 使用共享的 XLM-RoBERTa 编码器，结合三个专用解码器处理内容词识别、依存解析和形态句法特征预测。

Result: 在九种类型多样的语言中取得了平均 78.7% 的 MSLAS 分数、80.1% 的 LAS 分数和 90.3% 的 Feats F1 分数，性能位居榜单首位。

Conclusion: 模型性能显著，但在语法核心情况（如格标注）及名词性特征上还有改进空间。

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Finch-Zk的黑盒框架，利用细粒度跨模型一致性检测与缓解大型语言模型（LLMs）中可能出现的幻觉（即貌似可信但实际不准确的内容）问题，无需依赖外部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理多任务时表现优异，但容易生成含有事实错误的幻觉内容。因此，研究如何检测并缓解这种问题十分重要，尤其是在无需外部知识来源的情况下。

Method: 提出一种名为Finch-Zk的框架，通过对等义提示生成的跨模型回应进行一致性检查以揭示细粒度事实错误，并通过精准的修正技术对问题片段进行缓解。

Result: 在FELM数据集上，幻觉检测的F1评分提高了6-39%，在GPQA-diamond数据集上缓解技术使得回答准确性提升了7-8个百分点。

Conclusion: Finch-Zk是一种实用、适于部署的工具，可以提高生产环境中LLMs的事实可靠性，并显著改进幻觉问题的检测和缓解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

TL;DR: SurveyGen-I提供了一种自动化生成学术综述的框架，在检索、结构化和摘要生成等方面显著提升了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM技术在生成长篇多章节综述时常常存在连贯性不足和引用覆盖性差的问题，迫切需要一个更强的解决方案。

Method: 提出SurveyGen-I框架，通过粗到细的检索、自适应规划以及基于记忆的生成机制，既做到初步规划又在生成过程中动态调整。

Result: 在四个科学领域的实验中，SurveyGen-I在内容质量、一致性和引用覆盖性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SurveyGen-I的引入有效地提升了自动化学术综述生成的水平，解决了连贯性和全面性的问题。

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为行为对齐检索器（BAR）的方法，用于为工具增强型大语言模型提供行为一致的示例，从而提高调用决策的准确性，减少错误调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强型大语言模型的外部功能调用不准确会导致效率低下和成本上升。现有方法的效果有限，主要因为训练成本高且未考虑不一致的示例可能误导模型行为。

Method: 本文设计了一种行为对齐检索器（BAR），通过对比学习框架，利用自定义正/负样本对和双负对比损失训练检索器，确保能够检索行为一致的示例用于工具调用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够显著减少大语言模型的错误工具调用，同时保持高任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种成本效益高且高效的解决方案来改进工具增强型大语言模型的工具调用决策能力。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是目前LLMs在评估阅读材料难度与学生发展阶段认知能力之间的匹配性方面存在不足，亟需填补这一空白，特别是针对中国语言教育领域的需求。

Method: 提出了ZPD-SCA基准，由60名全国顶级特级教师注释，测试了LLMs在零样本学习和提供上下文例子情况下的表现差异。

Result: 实验表明，在零样本学习中，LLMs表现较差，但提供上下文后性能大幅提升。然而，各模型在不同体裁和认知匹配上的表现仍存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: ZPD-SCA为LLMs在认知匹配教育应用方面的评估与改进提供了基础，同时揭示了现有模型在教育性判断训练中的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Motivation: 随着LLMs被应用于决策关键领域，其置信度估计需要与实际准确性一致，现有校准方法存在监督需求或复杂性问题。

Method: 提出模仿“信度校准游戏”的提示式框架，通过反馈驱动的提示和总结实现动态校准。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在模型和游戏配置中一致提高了评估指标。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的提示是一种有效的LLM校准策略，具备应用潜力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DEPTH框架，以改进关系抽取任务，显著降低幻觉率并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在关系分类任务中表现出色，但在处理复杂句子结构或语义时，容易出现幻觉问题，从而影响知识图谱的质量。

Method: 提出DEPTH框架，包括依存句法简化和两层层次化优化模块。通过最短依存路径提取关系并通过整体句子理解进行精炼，并引入基于因果奖励的模型进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，DEPTH平均幻觉率降至7.0%，同时F1分数平均提升了17.2%。

Conclusion: DEPTH框架在提高关系抽取准确性和鲁棒性方面效果显著，是现有方法的有力改进。

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理需要结构化知识任务时推理链缺失和实体语义理解不足的问题。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2的混合型语言模型，通过采用Mamba-Transformer架构显著提升了推理相关任务的吞吐量，同时在准确性上达到了同类模型的新高度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种在推理任务（特别是长文本推理）中性能更高、准确性不妥协的语言模型，弥补现有同类模型在吞吐量和速度上的不足。

Method: 基于Nemotron-H架构，用Mamba-2层替代传统Transformer中的自注意力层；通过FP8训练处理20万亿个tokens，并利用Minitron策略将12B参数压缩为9B以适应单GPU推理，同时确保其推理能力用于大规模输入输出场景。

Result: Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2在推理基准测试中跟同类模型（如Qwen3-8B）相比达到相同或更好的准确性，并在8k输入和16k输出token的推理场景中实现最高6倍的推理吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2证明了优化的混合语言模型结构在推理任务中的优越性，其高吞吐与高效率不仅限于学术成果，还为大规模实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer在规则链式推理中的可解释性和适配性方面存在不足，且无法支持等效推理任务，如溯因推理或矛盾识别。

Method: 提出一种逻辑结构表示（RLS）方法，提取自然语言论证的逻辑原子以及相关规则，使推理变得简洁且易于实现，与传统方法不同，能够支持多种推理形式和交互式讨论。

Result: 在三个流行推理数据集上，高精度地识别并提取了自然语言论证的逻辑结构，显著扩展了推理能力，并支持生成解释。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了逻辑推理在自然语言处理任务中的适用性，不仅提高了解释生成，还使逻辑推理任务更具扩展性。

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

Result: 该模型在EmoTale数据集上通过单一说话人留出交叉验证，取得了64.1%的无权平均召回率（UAR），与现有丹麦语数据集DES表现相当。

Conclusion: EmoTale语料库能够支持有效的语音情感识别，为低资源语言的情感分析研究提供助力。

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

Result: 仅使用对比损失，提高关键点预测正确率16%。结合四元数骨骼编码后，骨骼角度误差减少6%。

Conclusion: 结合骨骼结构建模与语义引导优化，可显著提升Transformer在手语生成中的表现。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Motivation: 情感分析应用于文学文本面临着无法处理修辞语言及情感唤起策略等挑战，且传统方法在低资源语言中表现不佳，而现有模型缺乏细粒度结果。

Method: 开发了一种基于概念向量投影的连续情感评分方法，利用多语言文学数据进行训练，目标是更好捕捉不同语体与历史阶段的情感细节。

Result: 该方法在英文和丹麦文本测试中表现优越，生成的情感分布与人工评分结果高度一致，并支持更精确的情感分析和弧线建模。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

Motivation: 研究解决大型语言模型在包括一阶量词任务和线性函数分析等任务上的表现局限性。

Method: 提出了一种新的注意力机制评分方法，即Scaled Signed Averaging (SSA)，替代传统的Softmax方法。

Result: SSA显著提升了目标任务的表现，且在多种语言探测任务中优于基于Softmax的方法。

Conclusion: SSA是一个有效替代Softmax的方法，可以在保持或超越性能的情况下，改善模型的任务表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

Conclusion: ShizhenGPT开创了中医多模态诊断的先河，为领域进一步研究提供了基础，也展示了未来结合不同感知模式进行统一理解的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对传统文本增强方法仅局限于词汇级别的重新措辞以及在LLM中控制输出风格和结构的难题。

Method: 提出LMTransplant方法，通过将种子文本移植到由LLM扩展的上下文中，并要求LLM基于扩展的上下文重新生成变体。

Result: 在多种文本相关任务中，该方法展示出优越的性能，并随着增强数据规模的增长，表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LMTransplant充分利用了LLM嵌入的知识，生成更具多样性的内容级别变体，同时保留了原始文本的核心属性，在文本增强领域表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为TransLLM的新框架，将时空建模与大语言模型结合，在解决城市交通问题中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在交通领域存在模型针对性强、数据需求大，以及大语言模型难以处理结构化时空数据和数值推理的问题。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级时空编码器，通过可学习的提示组成机制与大语言模型结合，并通过强化学习训练的新颖提示路由机制动态个性化地指引任务推理。

Result: TransLLM在七个数据集和三个任务中表现优异，无论是监督学习还是零样本学习都取得了卓越的效果。

Conclusion: 该框架兼具较强的任务适应性和跨任务泛化能力，为城市交通问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用检索增强生成（RAG）技术处理电子健康记录（EHRs）中的非结构化文本的方法，提升了对复杂医疗任务的效率和性能，同时减少了输入文本的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EHR通常包含大量冗长、不一致的文本，对医生导航造成了挑战。随着大语言模型（LLMs）的发展，使用这些模型提取和分析非结构化文本具有潜力，但文本长度超出模型上下文范围的问题依然存在，需要一种解决方案。

Method: 提出了三项易于跨医疗系统复现的临床任务，即提取医学影像程序、生成抗生素使用时间线和识别关键诊断。使用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，结合三种最先进的大语言模型，对这些任务进行了测试，包括采用目标文本检索或最近的临床记录。

Result: 研究表明，RAG的性能接近甚至超过了使用最新临床记录的表现，并接近使用模型全上下文的效果，同时显著减少了输入令牌的数量。

Conclusion: RAG即使在新型模型能够处理更长文本的情况下，仍然是一种高效且具有竞争力的方法，适合EHR数据的处理和分析。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

TL;DR: 研究探索大语言模型在多种语言中通过长链式思维推理的能力，分析不同语言的推理表现及影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长链式思维推理多以英文为中心，缺乏对多语言推理能力的研究，研究旨在探讨这种推理方法在其他语言中的适用性和效果。

Method: 构建了翻译的推理数据集，针对法语、日语、拉脱维亚语和斯瓦希里语进行模型微调，并对Qwen系列模型的多语言长链推理表现进行了系统研究。

Result: 发现英语作为中介语言的有效性因语言而异，多语言语料库预训练可以缩小跨语言表现的差距；针对不同语言，数据规模与质量的权衡有差异，定制微调能显著改善特定语言的推理性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了长链式思维推理在多语言环境中的适用条件和局限性，并提供了相关翻译数据集以促进多语言推理研究的发展。

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

TL;DR: 近期开发的基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的深度研究代理尽管在复杂任务中表现出色，但在医疗领域表现有限。本研究提出了一种医疗深度研究代理，通过创新的数据生成框架和定制化的医疗检索引擎，显著提升其医疗领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用深度研究代理在处理复杂医疗任务时能力不足，主要由于模型缺乏密集医学知识和缺乏专门设计的医疗检索工具。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于医学知识图谱的数据合成框架和一个定制的私人医学检索引擎，通过问题生成和多工具交互训练模型，同时结合有监督微调和在线强化学习优化模型性能。

Result: 该方法生成了覆盖12个医学领域的2100+轨迹，模型在医疗基准测试中实现了新的性能记录，同时在通用研究任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过在架构、工具设计和训练数据方面的领域特定创新，小型开源模型在专门领域的表现可超越更大规模的专有系统。

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）因其生成策略的潜力，但部署在边缘设备上资源要求的限制使得量化研究变得重要。

Method: 识别激活异常值，使用先进的后量化方法（PTQ），并从多维视角进行评估：位宽、量化方法、任务类型和模型类型。

Result: 揭示了dLLMs在各配置条件下的量化行为特性，提供实用见解。

Conclusion: 研究为高效dLLM部署奠定了基础，其代码和实验配置将公开以支持研究社区。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）如何对情绪刺激进行评价，发现GPT-4和人类在情绪分类方面高度一致，但在兴奋度的评价上存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型（LLMs）如何评价情绪刺激，对于评估其在人类代理和交互中的应用效果至关重要。

Method: 通过让多个流行的LLMs对预标注了人类情绪内容的词汇和图像数据集进行评分，并将其与人类的评分结果进行对比分析。

Result: GPT-4与人类评分在情绪分类上的相关性较高（相关系数r≥0.9），对兴奋度的评价一致性偏低，而幸福感评分一致性最高。此外，LLMs在五种情绪分类框架（幸福、愤怒、悲伤、恐惧、厌恶）中的表现优于二维框架（兴奋度和效价）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物智能与人工智能在情绪刺激解读上的异同，为大型语言模型在情绪相关任务中的应用提供了基本理解。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

Motivation: 当前对复杂决策序列的解释能力仍然有限，此工作旨在结合LLMs的语言能力与决策程序的逻辑能力，提供更灵活且可理解的解决方案。

Method: 结合运用SAT求解器和LLMs，对于Hitori谜题中的约束条件通过短逻辑证明进行解释，而对于连通性约束则采用更适合的可视化解释方式。通过工具实现联合过程，帮助用户解谜。

Result: 文章展示了该神经符号工具在解决Hitori谜题中的实验有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了如何利用神经符号组合来提供灵活的综合解释能力，为解决此类混合约束问题开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

Conclusion: ORThought通过链式推理成功自动化复杂的优化建模，提供了未来研究优化建模的新方向和方法学上的借鉴。

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

Conclusion: H-J系统展示了以不确定性感知和知识约束的LLM方法在增强城市洪涝应急响应的弹性和效率方面的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

TL;DR: MCP-Universe是首个全面针对LLM评估现实复杂任务的基准，揭示当前顶尖模型在长语境和未知工具下的显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准太过简单，无法准确评估LLM在实际应用中的表现，因此需要一个更全面、更现实的评估工具。

Method: 设计并开发了MCP-Universe，包括6个核心领域、11个MCP服务器和多种评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器和动态评估器）。

Result: 顶尖模型如GPT-5、Grok-4和Claude-4.0-Sonnet表现均有显著局限，尤其在长输入上下文和使用未知工具时。

Conclusion: MCP-Universe填补了LLM评估领域的关键空白，并通过开源平台支持进一步创新。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对复杂CPS系统中模型手动提取困难的问题，提供数据驱动的解决方案，用以诊断和验证系统的安全性。

Method: 使用可能近似正确（PAC）学习方法，结合主动学习采样策略，进行离散逻辑与系统概率可达性分析的结合。

Result: 通过对自动车道保持系统的案例研究，证明了所提方法的有效性及其结果的概率置信度。

Conclusion: 提出了一种数据驱动的安全概率确定方法，展示了PAC学习在CPS系统验证中的潜力，尤其是在使用有限数据情况下信任度评估。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

TL;DR: 文章探讨了AI模型是否具有内省能力，并提出了一种更严格的定义。实验表明在更高标准下，AI可能未能实现真正的内省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 审视AI模型是否能够真实地了解或评估自身内部状态以更好地优化其性能。

Method: 提出了一种严格的内省定义，并通过实验研究了大型语言模型对其内部状态（如温度参数）的推理能力。

Result: 研究发现，大型语言模型可能表现出表面上的内省能力，但并未达到提出定义中的内省标准。

Conclusion: 现有的AI模型难以按照更严格的定义实现有意义的内省。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

### [126] [STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Brent ByungHoon Kang,Hyeongboo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架STAS，用于改进时空适应计算时间在脉冲神经网络中的应用，特别针对视觉Transformer (ViTs)，显著减少了能耗并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的脉冲神经网络（SNNs）尽管在能效上具有优势，但其多步操作特性导致了高延迟和计算开销。而现有处理方法大多针对特定冗余问题，缺乏统一的解决办法，尤其是在视觉Transformer中应用时存在架构静态性和时间相似性不足的问题。

Method: 作者提出了STAS框架，集成了自适应时空计算的原则，并设计了两个核心模块：整合的脉冲片分割(I-SPS)模块，通过创建统一输入表示来解决时间相似性不足的问题；自适应脉冲自注意力(A-SSA)模块，用于在时空轴上进行令牌剪枝。

Result: 实验在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上验证了该方法，相较于现有最佳模型(STOA)，STAS能耗减少了45.9%、43.8%和30.1%，同时精确度提高。

Conclusion: STAS框架通过重新设计SNN视觉Transformer的静态架构和动态计算策略，为时空适应计算提供了一个统一的方法，展现了在降低能耗和提高性能上的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨将学生数据从表格转换为图数据是否能提升退学预测的准确性，采用GNN模型与传统模型对比，并显示在特定配置下，GNN性能优于表格模型，但其他配置效果不确定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生辍学问题带来社会和经济成本。通过预测高风险学生，能够实现及时的干预。本研究旨在探讨将学生的表格数据转换成图结构后是否能提升预测模型的有效性。

Method: 本文将真实学生数据从表格转换为图，通过K-Means、HDBSCAN等聚类和PCA、UMAP等降维技术生成多种图结构，并使用自定义GCN模型和GraphSAGE模型对比传统模型（RF、XGBoost、TabNet）的表现。

Result: 某些特定配置如PCA-KMeans生成的图上，GraphSAGE模型表现优于XGBoost（最佳表格模型），宏F1得分提升约7个百分点，准确率提高近2个百分点。但其他GNN配置效果未能一致超过表格模型。

Conclusion: GNN在优化使用时具备潜力，但需要合适的图生成策略及模型选择，展现了将表格数据转换为图结构进行学习的机会与挑战。

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Method: 通过对62%稀疏的电厂负荷数据集进行统计分析，使用高斯插值方法处理稀疏数据，并使用多种机器学习和深度学习模型进行训练和性能比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，高斯插值方法能够有效处理稀疏数据，并且LSTM模型在一系列经典和基于神经网络的模型中性能最佳。

Conclusion: 采用高斯插值处理稀疏数据集是可行的，尤其适用于宽平稳假设的数据，同时LSTM模型在负荷预测问题上表现突出。

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Result: 方法表现出良好的可扩展性和通用性，在不同的元启发式方法和问题规模下均实现性能提升。

Conclusion: 混合方法为解决VRP提供了一种新思路，实验验证了其优势。

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Abstract: We present GP-MOBO, a novel multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm
that advances the state-of-the-art in molecular optimization. Our approach
integrates a fast minimal package for Exact Gaussian Processes (GPs) capable of
efficiently handling the full dimensionality of sparse molecular fingerprints
without the need for extensive computational resources. GP-MOBO consistently
outperforms traditional methods like GP-BO by fully leveraging fingerprint
dimensionality, leading to the identification of higher-quality and valid
SMILES. Moreover, our model achieves a broader exploration of the chemical
search space, as demonstrated by its superior proximity to the Pareto front in
all tested scenarios. Empirical results from the DockSTRING dataset reveal that
GP-MOBO yields higher geometric mean values across 20 Bayesian optimization
iterations, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in addressing complex
multi-objective optimization challenges with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MCLPD的半监督学习框架，通过对比学习预训练和轻量监督微调的方法，在跨数据集的帕金森检测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EEG帕金森检测模型在数据集有限且异构性较大的情况下表现不佳，因此提出一个增强模型鲁棒性和泛化能力的方法。

Method: MCLPD框架利用未标注的UNM数据集进行自监督预训练，通过时间和频率域的双重增强丰富数据，并融合时间频率信息；随后使用极少量标注数据进行监督微调。

Result: 在UI和UC数据集上分别使用1%的标注数据，F1得分达0.91和0.81；使用5%标注数据后，F1得分提升至0.97和0.87。

Conclusion: MCLPD框架在减少对标注数据依赖的同时，显著提升了跨数据集的通用性和检测性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Conclusion: GEPD模型通过结合生成网络和分类网络，有效解决了跨数据集场景的泛化能力问题，对神经系统疾病的检测和诊断具有推进作用。

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

Conclusion: PersRM-R1为个性化大模型的开发指明了方向，实现了准确性与通用性的平衡。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given

traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究引入了一种类似睡眠的回放巩固算法（SRC）用于平衡传播（EP）训练的循环神经网络（RNN），显著提高了其在持续学习情境中的抵抗灾难性遗忘能力。


<details>

Conclusion: 研究表明，类似睡眠的回放技术可以应用于循环神经网络，并有潜力将人类学习行为整合到人工神经网络中。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Conclusion: 通过将回归任务离散化并结合解耦分布对齐，DRILL框架有效解决了半监督回归中的过拟合与伪标签依赖问题，表现出优秀性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨通过字图表示学习和对比学习方法，解决低质量数据中推断人群流量的问题，提出了新方法\model，并在真实数据集上证明其有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机在于传统城市感知技术的数据质量不足，无法准确监测兴趣点（POIs）的人群流量，且标注数据稀缺，POIs 之间的时空依赖复杂，以及人群流量与GPS报告间的相关性高度复杂。

Method: 提出了一种对比自学习框架\model，将人群流量推断建模为自监督的属性图表示学习任务。该方法通过基于兴趣点的距离构建空间邻接图，采用交换式预测的对比学习方式利用大量未标注时空数据，随后通过精确标注数据进行微调。

Conclusion: 提出的\model方法有效地利用了低质量和噪声数据，解决了POI人群流量推断中的关键挑战，并取得了优异结果。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Motivation: 旨在解决现有方法在解析偏微分方程和次网格闭合问题时的局限性，提出一种能够结合物理参数变化并在单位一致性下进行回归分析的新方法。

Method: 在SINDy方法基础上，创新性地引入象征参数化、维度相似性过滤器、内存高效的Gram矩阵累积以及系数稳定性分析的集成共识方法。

Result: 通过经典的一维基准验证了方法的稳健性，并发现了与Smagorinsky型闭合结构相关的次网格闭合模型，精度达到 $R^2 = 0.886$。

Conclusion: 本框架能够自主发现物理意义明确的次网格模型，并为湍流建模提供了一种数据驱动的闭合发现新途径。

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CoBAD在集体异常检测中展示出优越性能，填补了集体异常检测领域的部分空白，同时提供了一个可公开使用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

Motivation: 当前用于知识图谱链接预测的GNN缺乏可解释性，亟需一种方法来解释其预测并分析模型的表达能力。

Method: 将GNN与评分函数结合，设计单调性模型，从中提取可解释的Datalog规则，并定义获取等价规则程序。

Result: 实验表明，单调GNN与评分函数在链接预测基准上性能良好，能够生成大量可靠规则。

Conclusion: 融合单调性和评分函数的GNN不仅提供了良好的预测能力，还显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Motivation: 传统的奖励机制无法很好地分离环境中的已知信息和需要采样探测的未知信息，而这种分离可以通过提高样本利用率来加速学习过程。

Method: 引入了一种物理启发奖励机制（pRMs），结合反事实经验生成和奖励形状化的技术，构建并设计适用于强化学习算法的目标与奖励结构。

Result: 实验验证表明，pRMs能够通过提升强化学习的奖励获取速率来加快训练，即便是在有限和连续的物理环境中，pRMs在控制任务中的学习效率也显著提高。

Conclusion: pRMs的引入展示了其在增强学习任务编程能力、表达复杂目标及提升学习效率方面的显著优势。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Motivation: 在预算受限的情况下，研究如何从不同难度的数据中选择最佳训练数据以最大化语言模型的性能提升。

Method: 利用基于多样本评估的方法对数据难度进行估计，并比较选择不同难度数据进行语言模型微调的效果。这是通过在不同模型规模和家族上执行分组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行实验实现的。

Conclusion: 在预算受限的情况下，优先选择高难度数据进行GRPO微调训练是提升推理任务性能的最佳策略。

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from

Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm,
where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency.

trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities

### [152] [A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125)
*Madyan Bagosher,Tala Mustafa,Mohammad Alsmirat,Amal Al-Ali,Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh*

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种智能框架，通过整合街道地图、流动性和气象数据来管理停车场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大学校园停车位有限，需快速找到空车位以应对学生需求。

Method: 框架整合时空数据，通过回归模型（如线性回归、SVR、RFR和LSTM）预测停车区域；并使用超参数调优与指标（如RMSE、MAE和R2）评估模型性能。

Result: 随机森林回归（RFR）在评估中表现最佳，取得最低RMSE 0.142和最高R2 0.582。

Conclusion: 提出的智能系统无需安装额外传感器，通过数据整合为停车管理提供高效解决方案，但LSTM模型在更长的数据时段中有潜在优势。

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合实验数据、机器学习及优化方法探索新型合金设计的可行性，并可推广到其他材料设计领域。

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的时间序列分类框架ERIS，旨在通过引入语义引导的特性解耦提高分布外数据的可靠性，该框架在实验中提升了4.04%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分类方法在分布外数据中表现不佳，原因是模型将领域相关特征和标签相关特征混杂在一起，形成虚假相关性。需要设计一种方法实现特性解耦并引入语义指导。

Method: 提出了ERIS框架，包含三个核心机制：1. 能量引导校准机制提供语义指导；2. 权重正交性策略使领域特征和标签特征独立；3. 帮助提高鲁棒性的辅助对抗训练机制。

Result: 通过实验，该框架在四个基准测试集上平均提高了4.04%的分类准确率，明显优于现有的最优方法。

Conclusion: ERIS框架通过语义指导和新颖的机制实现了可靠的特性解耦，在时间序列分类中展现了鲁棒性和高性能。

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Conclusion: G2GNet在减少模型参数和计算量的同时提升了精度，证明了生物神经网络启发的稀疏连接设计对人工神经网络优化的有效性。

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过元学习方法估算交通网络的宏观基本图，并应用于数据较为稀缺的城市场景，显示出显著的改善效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在交通网络的宏观基本图(MFD)估算中，通常需要大量的回路检测器数据，而这些数据在实际中并不总是可用。针对数据稀缺性问题，本文探索通过元学习的方式解决挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于元学习的框架，结合多任务物理相关神经网络模型来估算MFD。采用从多个城市收集的数据进行训练和测试，以适应不同探测器分布和拓扑结构的城市。

Result: 实验结果表明，作者提出的模型平均流量预测误差(MSE)相比传统方法有显著改善，范围在17500到36000之间。同时验证了其在数据有限城市中的表现优越。

Conclusion: 元学习框架证明了其可在不同城市的数据环境中有效推广，尤其在探测器有限区域表现优秀。此外，通过与传统迁移学习和文献中的非参数模型对比，进一步体现了该框架的可转移性和优越性。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的认知建模框架——记忆-摊销推断（MAI），将智能描述为围绕记忆中潜在周期的推断，而非通过传统的梯度下降进行重计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的智能模型通常将认知视为从头优化的过程，忽略了经验和结构性记忆的再利用。本文旨在提出一种能够有效利用记忆和历史推断的智能模型。

Method: 通过引入MAI框架，支持结构性再利用记忆，基于delta-同调理论和拓扑记忆，重新定义智能系统的推断过程，并与强化学习中的时间反演双重性进行对比。

Result: MAI提供了一种支持上下文感知和结构保留推断的理论，同时提出了能量高效推断的新途径，并解释了大脑皮层通用算法的作用。

Conclusion: MAI为智能的本质提供了统一的、生物学基础理论，为实现人工通用智能提供了深远的启示。

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data
Description (TGN-SVDD) model, designed to enhance detection accuracy in the

experiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate
significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline

Conclusion: 研究结果可为未来内河航运的更可靠轨迹预测方法开发提供指导，从而提高安全性与效率。

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Motivation: 现有CBMs忽略了概念之间的内在关系，而这些关系在许多实际问题中是显而易见的。

Method: 通过构建潜在概念图(Graph)来建模概念间关系，并将其结合到现有的CBMs中以提升其性能与解释性。

Conclusion: GraphCBMs通过整合概念间的关系显著提升了CBMs的性能与应用潜力，且在解释性和任务表现方面更具优势。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

Conclusion: ABMLL方法提升了大语言模型的泛化能力与不确定性量化能力，尤其适用于低成本高效的微调场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on

training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的测试时比例缩放方法分为RL和基于静态奖励模型的搜索两种，它们分别存在不稳定性、样本效率低、依赖昂贵人工标签和分布泛化能力弱的问题。

Method: 采用对抗逆强化学习（AIRL）与群组相对策略优化（GRPO），从正确的推理轨迹中学习动态奖励模型（PRM），将其用于RL回滚的评估器和搜索指导，并消除对标签数据的依赖。

Result: 在数学、科学推理和代码生成等8个基准上提升平均性能9%，且集成于多种搜索算法后，其PRM表现优于所有带标签训练的基线PRM。

Conclusion: 奖励函数在RL中不仅是关键因素，也是最佳的搜索指导PRM，为复杂推理任务提供了稳健且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

*Pritthijit Nath,Sebastian Schemm,Henry Moss,Peter Haynes,Emily Shuckburgh,Mark Webb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种联邦强化学习框架（FedRAIN-Lite）来优化气候模型的参数化过程，克服传统方法静态且离线调整的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统气候模型参数化方法静态且离线调整，无法适应气候状态的动态变化，因此需要一种更具适应性的方法。

Method: 采用联邦强化学习框架（FedRAIN-Lite），通过将代理分配到不同纬度带，局部学习并定期进行全局聚合，同时利用简化的能量平衡气候模型层级测试了多种强化学习算法。

Result: 实验表明DDPG算法在速度收敛性和误差控制方面表现优于传统静态方法以及单一代理方法，特别是在热带和中纬度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了联邦强化学习在地理自适应参数学习中的潜力，为构建复杂的、大规模的在线气候模型提供了一个高效可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位因卫星信号传播及设备硬件质量低导致的误差问题。

Result: 在公开基准和自有数据集上测试证明显著提升了定位精度，并在移动设备端实现其实时性能。

Conclusion: NeRC框架通过创新训练范式减少了标注需求，有效提升了定位性能，并在应用部署上展现了潜力。

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuPO为一种无注释反馈生成的双学习优化框架，利用通用双性克服了RLVR和传统双学习的局限性，能广泛适用于非可逆任务并优化LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)需要昂贵标签且只适用于可验证任务，以及传统双学习仅限于严格双任务对的问题。

Method: 通过将主任务输入分解为已知与未知部分，构建基于主输出和已知信息的对偶任务以重构未知部分，这一重构质量作为自监督奖励优化主任务。在单一模型中实现两任务同时运作。

Result: DuPO在多个任务中表现出显著提升：在756个翻译任务方向上平均提高2.13 COMET分值；在三个数学推理挑战基准上平均提高6.4分；作为推理时重排增强器提高9.3分。

Conclusion: DuPO被验证为一种可扩展、通用且无需注释的高效LLM优化范式。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Result: 结果表明，教师指导能显著提升早期策略性能和收敛速度。

Conclusion: 教师指导技术在提高自动化网络安全中RL训练效率方面具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注GNNs中学习算法在无噪声条件下的收敛性，而缺乏对噪声条件下学习算法表现与图结构之间联系的深入研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文将传统学习理论中的设置扩展到GNNs背景，通过谱图理论推导SGD与岭回归的过度风险，分析正则图与幂律图结构对学习算法表现的影响，并扩展到多层线性GNNs，探讨过度平滑问题。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了图结构、GNN与学习算法间的相互关系，为GNN算法设计与选择提供了新的洞见。

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合流匹配和占用检测模型的生成模型，用于预测偷猎者行为，从而提高保护计划的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偷猎对野生动物和生物多样性构成威胁，准确预测偷猎行为将有助于制定巡逻计划及实施保护干预。

Method: 通过将流匹配与占用检测模型结合，在潜在空间中对偷猎事件的检测不完美性进行建模，同时采用从线性模型预测初始的复合流以缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在乌干达的两个国家公园数据集中实现了预测精度的持续提升。

Conclusion: 本文方法证明了流匹配与占用检测结合的生成模型在偷猎预测中的有效性，具有从有限数据中更好地提取复杂的时空模式的能力。

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Conclusion: 本研究深化了对SGGMs的理论理解，展示了其在关键领域的应用潜力，并提供了有效模型设计的实用指导。

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

Motivation: 现有的图扩散生成模型在可扩展性和图形大小泛化能力方面存在不足，无法有效处理大规模图数据，也难以适应未知大小的图形生成需求。

Conclusion: SBGD模型不仅提高了图扩散生成模型的可扩展性和效率，还为模块化生成建模树立了新的范例，展示了通过将复杂任务分解为更易管理部分的潜力。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Result: 在CAGE-2基准测试中，MOBAL显示出明显的适应性和对模型误差的鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOBAL能在事件变化时动态调整模型并提供高效的响应支持，可作为网络事件响应的有效工具。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化噪声调度和采用独立训练的单潜在状态模型，可以有效减少扩散模型的训练复杂度，同时保持生成效果。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and

Conclusion: 反事实基线提供了一种更合理的方法来代表医学数据中特征的缺失性，能够提高深度学习模型的医学适用性和解释性。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对FANOVA GP模型的精确Shapley值计算方法，将复杂度降至二次时间，并应用于局部和全局解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Shapley值的计算复杂度随特征数量指数级增长，尤其对于预测输出为随机变量的模型，如高斯过程(GP)，计算更具挑战性。

Method: 利用FANOVA GP模型中的闭式(stochastic) Möbius分解，提出基于递归算法的精确Shapley值计算方法，局部解释采用随机合作博弈，全局解释基于方差驱动的值函数。

Result: 提出的方法能够在二次时间内计算精确的局部和全局Shapley解释，成功地量化了特征贡献及其不确定性。

Conclusion: 本方法改进了FANOVA GP的解释能力，以更可扩展、符合公理化且能解释不确定性的方式提升了可解释AI系统的实用性。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如语义熵依赖于后软最大化概率，不能很好地捕获模型内在的不确定性，因此在一些场景中效果不佳。

Method: 引入语义能量，通过对倒数第二层的logits进行操作，结合语义聚类与Boltzmann能量分布以更好地捕捉不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，语义能量在多个基准测试中显著改进了幻觉检测和不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 语义能量为下游任务如幻觉检测提供了更可依赖的信号，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准神经网络在准确近似复杂动作值函数时存在困难，研究希望通过改进特征表示模型提高DQN效率和性能。

Method: 在DQN框架中引入切比雪夫多项式基础，提供更强大的特征表示能力，并测试在CartPole-v1基准上的性能表现。

Result: Ch-DQN（多项式阶数N=4）较标准DQN表现出约39%的更高性能，而高阶多项式（N=8）对学习不利。

Conclusion: 切比雪夫多项式在深度强化学习中具有潜力，但模型复杂性和超参数选择需权衡。

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究关注优化大型语言模型(LLM)推理调度，以减少总延迟，并提出了使用机器学习预测输出长度的改进算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是提高LLM推理调度效率，在应对大量请求时减少延迟与能耗。由于输出长度未知，这带来了调度上的关键性挑战。

Method: 提出两种算法：保守的$\mathcal{A}_{\max}$基于预测输出长度的上界调度，和自适应的$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$使用预测下界并在推理中动态调整估算。$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$展现出更高效和稳健性。

Result: 数值模拟证明$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$接近完全知情调度器，性能高效且稳健。同时，它仅依赖于预测区间的下界，避免了对较难预测的上界的需求。

Conclusion: $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$相比$\mathcal{A}_{\max}$展现更优性能，尤其适合实际不确定的环境，并能有效最小化LLM推理的延迟及能耗。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Result: ELATE方法实验显示，在多个领域的预测任务中准确度平均提高了8.4%。

Conclusion: ELATE证明了在通过自动化特征工程提升时间序列预测性能中的有效性与潜力。

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Result: 实验证明FedEve在非独立同分布数据和跨设备场景下优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FedEve能够有效解决数据异质性问题，显著提升了跨设备联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Conclusion: 动态拓扑、非均匀聚合策略和客户端选择的结合可以显著提升分布式SGD模型的性能，并与理论收敛保证相一致。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM在无需重新训练的情况下显著提升了多模态约束分子生成的效率和灵活性，可广泛应用于药物发现等相关领域。

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

Motivation: 由于相似性选择的目标依赖性复杂，现有研究难以测试IIA假设，而IIA在相似性选择中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 提出两种统计方法——经典的拟合优度测试和基于后验预测检查（PPC）的贝叶斯测试，用于检测IIA假设是否成立，并创建两组数据集进行验证。

Result: 在两组数据集上IIA均被显著破坏，同时发现选择集的上下文效应是违规的主要原因。

Conclusion: 研究表明需要开发新的考虑上下文效应的相似性选择模型，以更好地解释实际中的选择行为。

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PepThink-R1，一个结合语言模型、链式思考和强化学习的框架，用于优化治疗性肽的设计，从而提升其理化特性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前治疗性肽设计面临着序列空间庞大、实验数据匮乏以及生成模型可解释性差的挑战，亟需一种可整合优化和解释功能的生成方法。

Method: PepThink-R1通过结合大型语言模型、链式思考的监督微调和强化学习，利用定制的奖赏函数在生成序列过程中平衡化学有效性和特性改进，同时实现对单体层级修改进行显式推理。

Result: 该方法生成的环肽在亲脂性、稳定性和暴露性方面取得显著提升，在优化成功率和可解释性上优于现有的通用和领域特定模型。

Conclusion: PepThink-R1展示了首个以语言模型为基础结合显式推理与强化学习的肽设计框架，为治疗性肽的可靠优化与透明设计提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合模糊逻辑和机器学习的解释性AI框架（FEXAI），通过对1094次航班数据分析分类飞行因素以优化持续下降操作（CDO）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDO能减少燃料消耗、排放和噪音，同时提高效率和乘客舒适性，但相关研究缺乏系统性，且现有方法缺乏航空领域所需的可解释性。

Method: 研究利用ADS-B收集29项特征数据，并结合机器学习和SHAP分析分类飞行CDO遵循水平，同时基于模糊逻辑构建可解释规则。

Result: 模型分类准确率超过90%，关键因素为到达路线内平均下降率、下降段数及下降过程中方向变化平均值。

Conclusion: FEXAI框架提出了可实践的操作决策支持途径，有助于实时建议在不同条件下保持CDO遵从性。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将SNOMED医学术语的层级结构嵌入超曲面空间（Poincaré嵌入）内，并应用于深度学习模型，旨在改善肺癌发病预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的临床预测模型缺乏对临床概念间语义关系的利用，为了提升预测能力，研究者尝试将医学术语的领域知识以低维方式加入模型。

Method: 从SNOMED分类中构建临床知识图谱，用黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，将这些嵌入整合入ResNet和Transformer两种深度学习架构，并评估模型的区分能力和校准性能。

Result: 加入Poincaré嵌入后，模型特别是ResNet的识别和校准性能相较于使用随机初始化欧几里得嵌入的模型有所提升，Transformer模型显示校准性能较稳定。

Conclusion: 使用基于超曲面空间的临床知识嵌入能够有效利用医学术语的层次结构，提升了肺癌发病预测的表现，并展现了结合数据驱动特征提取与已有临床知识的潜力。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据分析工具在精确性上存在不足，特别是假设神经网络的损失函数为凸问题，导致方法的实现难度较大。

Method: 提出Diff-In方法，将样本影响定义为训练迭代过程中其变化的累积和，并通过二阶近似计算这些变化，既提高精确性又无需依赖模型凸性。

Result: Diff-In在影响力估算误差方面显著低于现有方法，并在数据清理、数据删除和核心集选择任务的多个基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: Diff-In方法不仅能扩展到大规模数据集，且在性能和计算效率上均超越现有基准方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Fair-ICD的新方法，通过反事实数据增强实现GNN公平性，同时保持预测性能。

Motivation: GNN存在在种族、性别等敏感属性上产生偏见的问题，传统缓解偏见的方法可能损害预测准确性和平衡。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强生成多样化邻域，并通过对抗性鉴别器减少预测偏见。

Result: 在使用三种GNN骨干网络的标准数据集上，Fair-ICD显著提高了公平性指标，并保持了较高的预测性能。

Conclusion: Fair-ICD在适度条件下能够实现GNN的公平性与高预测性能的平衡。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架证明了其在复杂目标学习中的有效性，通过高效技能编译和目标分解机制大幅提升了开放式AI代理的能力。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Motivation: 现有的联邦蒸馏方法在知识筛选上效率低下，并且难以应用于资源受限的边缘设备。因此，研究目标是设计一种资源高效、鲁棒性强且易于实际应用的联邦蒸馏框架。

Method: 提出了EdgeFD，利用高效的KMeans算法进行客户端的密度比估计，不需伺服端进行知识筛选，从而降低复杂性及延迟，同时支持在异构数据分布下的高效联邦蒸馏。

Conclusion: EdgeFD在确保高性能知识共享的同时，显著降低了计算开销，提升了联邦蒸馏的可扩展性及实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的扩散模型方法——压缩扩散模型（SDM），通过数据相关的各向异性噪声缩放改进生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型通常使用各向同性的高斯噪声，忽视了数据的结构性。受量子压缩态重新分布不确定性的启发，作者希望通过噪声缩放来更好地学习数据的重要特征。

Method: 提出两种压缩扩散模型配置：一种是补偿主轴缩放的海森堡扩散模型，另一种是只对主轴缩放的标准压缩扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，在CIFAR-10/100和CelebA-64数据集上，轻微的反向压缩（增大主轴的方差）能显著提升生成效果，FID指标降低最多可达15%。

Conclusion: 数据相关的简单噪声形状调整可以在无架构改变的情况下带来显著的生成性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Motivation: 基于压缩距离的相似性测量方式灵活但在特定任务中存在对齐困难，特别是分类或复杂的聚类环境中。

Result: 实验证明，这种方法在文本和真实音频等异构数据集上的鲁棒性和通用性，可替代常见的跨导向方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法改变了基于压缩方法的应用方向，从单纯探索数据结构转变为主动塑造特定目标的特征空间。

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的生成模型指导框架，名为Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM)，通过直接修改源分布而保持向量场不变，并提供理论证明及实验验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的指导方法依赖于在概率流向量场上添加指导场，这存在一定局限性。本研究的动机是通过直接操作源分布，简化生成过程并提高指导的灵活性。

Method: 提出Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM)框架，通过更改源分布来达到目标分布，同时保持预训练的向量场不变。理论上证明了SGFM能精确恢复目标分布，并进一步提供关于分布误差的理论界限。

Result: 实验结果表明，SGFM框架在合成数据集、图像数据集以及物理相关任务上的表现优良，并验证了其方法的灵活性和有效性。

Conclusion: SGFM为生成模型的指导问题提供了新的解决方案，通过灵活选择采样方法以及与流匹配模型的自然整合，实现了对目标分布的有效指导。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为CoEBA的新方法，用于改进图中的链接预测，基于对比学习增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链接预测是图挖掘中的核心任务，为此研究探索对比学习在提升性能中的应用。然而现有研究在理论分析和对节点度的考虑上存在不足，这激发了作者对此进行改进。

Method: 研究首先对链接预测中的对比学习进行理论分析并提出Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA)方法，通过调整节点度作为数据增强策略，并结合新的对比学习损失设计了CoEBA模型。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，CoEBA的性能显著优于其他最先进的链接预测模型。

Conclusion: CoEBA方法不仅提供了理论支持，还通过创新的数据增强和损失设计提高了链接预测精度，为该领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨通过使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线，以改进Successive Halving算法的资源分配方式，避免过早停止潜力候选者的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Successive Halving算法依赖于中间性能值来进行资源分配，这可能会导致对一些“慢启动”但最终会表现优秀的模型的过早淘汰。

Method: 通过结合潜在Kronecker高斯过程，用预测的学习曲线表现引导Successive Halving的资源分配决策，并与基于当前性能值的传统方法进行对比。

Result: 实验表明，预测方法能取得竞争性表现，但相比增加资源投入于标准方法，并不具备帕累托最优性，因为预测模型需依赖完整的学习曲线作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 尽管存在依赖完整学习曲线的局限性，这一预测方法的潜在不足可以通过利用已有的学习曲线数据来缓解。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Motivation: 探索如何在无训练数据的前提下，通过预训练模型的权重来合成一个表现更优的神经网络，尤其是对出分布数据表现的改进。

Method: 提出了一种数据无关的元优化方法AME，通过将模型之间的差异视为伪梯度，来更新神经网络的权重，重新解释了model soup并扩展了其能力。

Result: 通过AME获得的平均化神经网络在个体模型和model soup基线之上表现更优，特别是在出分布场景下效果明显。

Conclusion: AME提供了一种可推广的数据无关的权重聚合方法，为神经网络平均化提供了新的定义和方法论。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind
enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model
achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a
substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other

Motivation: 大语言模型在关键任务中的应用逐渐增多，但面对对抗性触发器的攻击表现出脆弱性。现有方法存在效率低下或复杂性高等问题，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用了一种内在优化方法，通过指数梯度下降与Bregman投影直接优化对抗性后缀的松弛one-hot编码，保持在概率单纯形内。

Conclusion: 本文方法在提高大语言模型的鲁棒性和安全性对抗上展示了优异效果，为对抗性攻击的防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

Conclusion: 本文建立了一种理解TD过拟合的心智模型和指导原则，为深度强化学习中的计算优化扩展提供了基础，类似于监督学习中的扩展研究。

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

*Hangming Zhang,Zheng Li,Qiang Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM)的新方法，实现了ANN到SNN几乎无损转换，并在复杂任务中保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ANN到SNN转换方法难以在超低延迟（一时间步）中实现无准确率损失，并且量化层信息损耗严重，超参数敏感性高。

Method: 通过信息熵分析量化层中的信息损失，引入了PMSM和量化层的超参数调整策略。

Result: 在ViT-S架构下，实验结果在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上达到新的基准，并在VGG-16架构下相比基线方法能耗降低5倍以上。

Conclusion: PMSM方法有效解决 ANN到SNN转换中量化层信息损失问题，显著提高精度和能效，为下一代高效SNN研究提供了借鉴。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency
via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of
non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high
computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN
conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These
conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the
quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical
minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to
realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current
quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following
batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter
configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first
time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through
the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce
Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy
tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless
ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also
leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain
stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100
and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,
establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method
reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
compared to the baseline method.
