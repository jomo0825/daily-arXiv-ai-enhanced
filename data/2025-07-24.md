### [1] [Post-Disaster Affected Area Segmentation with a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based EVAP Model using Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16849)
*Yi-Shan Chu,Hsuan-Cheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉变换器（ViT）的深度学习框架，用于改进遥感影像中受灾区域的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在支持和改进台湾太空总署（TASA）开发的应急价值增强产品（EVAP）能力，解决灾后区域分割在没有准确标注的情况下的难题。

Method: 通过少量手动标注的区域，使用PCA特征分析和信心指数扩展这些标注生成弱监督训练集，随后利用基于ViT的编码器-解码器模型结合多波段影像数据进行训练，并采用多解码器变体和多阶段损失策略优化性能。

Result: 此框架在评估中与高分辨率EVAP结果比较，显示出更平滑和一致的分割性能，案例研究表明其对2022年鄱阳湖干旱和2023年罗德岛野火的受灾地图生成有所改进。

Conclusion: 该框架在没有准确标注的情况下提供了一种可扩展的灾害绘图方法，提高了分割结果的光滑性与可靠性。

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

### [2] [Toward a Real-Time Framework for Accurate Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16850)
*Mohamed Adjel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合实时2D关键点检测与几何感知的2D到3D提升方法，利用摄像机参数和解剖学先验知识，解决单目3D人体姿态估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决单目3D人体姿态估计困难，特别是实时和非受控环境中，提出比直接2D到3D方法更轻量灵活的替代方案。

Method: 利用自校准和生物力学逆运动学技术生成大规模2D-3D训练数据对，从而结合几何感知的2D到3D提升框架。框架包含实时2D关键点检测和先验知识的整合。

Result: 无需特殊硬件，实现快速、个性化且准确的单目3D姿态估计。

Conclusion: 数据驱动与模型先验相结合，可提升边缘设备上单目3D人体运动捕获的准确性、可解释性和可部署性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

### [3] [Coarse-to-fine crack cue for robust crack detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16851)
*Zelong Liu,Yuliang Gu,Zhichao Sun,Huachao Zhu,Xin Xiao,Bo Du,Laurent Najman,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackCue是一种新的用于裂缝检测的方法，通过粗到细的裂缝线索生成提高检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著增强现有检测网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法虽然在数据集内表现优异，但在处理未见过的数据域（域泛化）时仍然面临挑战。此外，裂缝的薄结构特性往往被忽视。本文旨在借助裂缝的薄结构特性提出一种方法以提高其检测的泛化能力。

Method: 引入CrackCue方法，首先通过最大池化和上采样操作生成粗糙裂缝背景，然后使用重建网络生成更细致的裂缝背景，并通过两者的差异得到精细的裂缝线索。此线索不受复杂背景、阴影和光照变化的影响，可作为鲁棒检测的指导线索。

Result: 将CrackCue集成到三种先进的裂缝检测网络中，实验结果证明其显著提升了基线方法的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrackCue是一种高效的、可插入现有网络的新方法，提升裂缝检测的准确性和鲁棒性，代码将在公开平台上发布。

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

### [4] [CLAMP: Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Fusion for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16854)
*Xiaoqiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLAMP框架，通过多模块协作显著提升了多模态细粒度情感分析的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态细粒度情感分析中存在的跨模态对齐噪声和表示不一致问题，与此同时弥补现有方法在局部细粒度对齐中的不足。

Method: 提出了CLAMP框架，包含渐进注意力融合网络、多任务对比学习和自适应多损失聚合模块。该框架通过层次化的跨模态交互提升文本和图像区域间的对齐，结合全局和局部的对比学习增强模态一致性，并通过动态权重调整缓解梯度干扰。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，CLAMP框架的性能在绝大多数情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLAMP框架通过联合使用多种创新模块，有效地解决了多模态情感分析中的对齐和一致性问题，为实际应用提供了性能更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

### [5] [SIA: Enhancing Safety via Intent Awareness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16856)
*Youngjin Na,Sangheon Jeong,Youngwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SIA框架，通过三阶段推理过程动态检测和缓解多模态输入中的潜在有害意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当图文模型与现实世界应用结合时，涉及多模态数据的潜在安全问题亟需解决。

Method: 提出SIA框架，包括视觉抽象（图像描述）、意图推断（基于少量示例的思维链提示）和基于意图的响应优化三阶段推理过程。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试上表现优异，显著提升了模型的安全性，但在MMStar上推理准确率略有下降。

Conclusion: SIA通过意图感知提升了图文模型的安全性，并且在贴合人类价值观的同时展示了其实用性。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

### [6] [Look Before You Fuse: 2D-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16861)
*Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个以2D先验信息为基础的新方法，通过执行深度对齐和融合以解决传统方法中存在的相机和LiDAR特征失配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用2D物体的先验信息来解决由于外在校准误差和LiDAR滚动快门效应引起的投影误差问题，旨在实现跨模态特征的精准融合。

Method: 提出Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC)和Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)两种方法分别解决局部和全局特征匹配问题，并通过Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM)利用门控注意机制进行特征融合。

Result: 在nuScenes验证集上取得了mAP 71.5%和NDS 73.6%的领先表现，达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过更精确的深度校准和特征融合，该方法有效提高了自动驾驶车辆3D感知的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

*Hongcheng Gao,Zihao Huang,Lin Xu,Jingyi Tang,Xinhao Li,Yue Liu,Haoyang Li,Taihang Hu,Minhua Lin,Xinlong Yang,Ge Wu,Balong Bi,Hongyu Chen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Turing Eye Test (TET)的新基准，通过四项感知任务评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在合成人类直观理解图像上的表现，发现现有模型在这些任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的研究主要集中在推理能力上，很少关注其真实感知世界的能力。因此，该研究试图评估MLLMs是否能真正像人类一样感知，并探索其感知领域的不足之处。

Method: 本文设计了一个名为Turing Eye Test (TET)的基准，其中包含四个专注于感知的诊断任务。这些任务使用人类能够直观处理的合成图像，测试当前MLLMs的感知性能。另外，本文对比了语言骨干网络的不同调优方法在感知中的效果。

Result: 结果表明，当前最先进的MLLMs在这些感知任务上表现严重不足。在文本背景学习和骨干网络训练无法显著提高模型表现的情况下，通过微调视觉塔（vision tower）可以实现快速提升，展示了视觉塔在感知领域推广上的挑战性。

Conclusion: 本文强调了当前MLLMs在视觉感知和推广能力上的局限性，并指出这些问题可能源于视觉塔的泛化能力不足，而非语言骨干的知识或推理能力问题。未来将基于这些发现引入更多多样化任务和方法来强化模型的视觉推广能力。

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

### [8] [HIPPO-Video: Simulating Watch Histories with Large Language Models for Personalized Video Highlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16873)
*Jeongeun Lee,Youngjae Yu,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HIPPO-Video，一个用于个性化视频高光生成的全新数据集，并通过HiPHer方法验证该数据集在实现用户视频偏好预测方面的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频数据集缺乏对个性化偏好的关注，不能有效捕捉用户复杂多变的行为和喜好，这凸显了开发适应用户个性化需求的解决方案的必要性。

Method: 通过基于LLM的大型语言模型用户模拟器生成多样化的观看历史，构建了HIPPO-Video数据集，并提出HiPHer方法，基于个性化的观看历史预测用户的段落相关显著性得分。

Result: HiPHer方法在实验中表现优异，优于现有通用方法和基于查询的方法，体现其在个性化视频高光生成领域的潜力。

Conclusion: HIPPO-Video数据集和HiPHer方法在个性化视频高光生成上表现出色，能够更精确地反映用户独特的偏好并推动相关研究的发展。

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.

### [9] [ReMeREC: Relation-aware and Multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16877)
*Yizhi Hu,Zezhao Tian,Xingqun Qi,Chen Su,Bingkun Yang,Junhui Yin,Muyi Sun,Man Zhang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 构建了一个新的多实体参考表达理解数据集ReMeX，同时提出了一个名为ReMeREC的新框架，用于利用视觉和文本提示实现多实体的定位和关系建模。实验结果表明，其在多实体定位和关系预测上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单实体定位上存在不足，且缺乏高质量、多实体的图文关系数据集，导致在处理复杂多实体场景时的准确性和可行性受限。

Method: 提出一个新数据集ReMeX，并设计了一种新框架ReMeREC，该框架通过Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) 动态推断实体数量和范畴，同时加入Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR)进行场景建模。此外，还使用大型语言模型生成小规模辅助数据集EntityText用于精细语言理解。

Result: 实验在四个基准数据集上表明，ReMeREC在多实体定位和关系预测任务中达到了最新的性能标准，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑多实体场景下的关系建模和细粒度的语言-视觉理解，ReMeREC显著提升了多实体定位和关系建模的效率及精度，展现出构建优质数据集和设计新框架对相关任务的巨大价值。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

### [10] [CausalStep: A Benchmark for Explicit Stepwise Causal Reasoning in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16878)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入了一个名为CausalStep的基准测试，用于评估视频中的因果与逐步推理能力，并指出当前模型与人类水平的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在文本和图像推理上取得了进展，但视频推理仍然面临重大挑战。当前的视频基准测试未能充分评估因果和逐步推理的能力。

Method: 提出一个新的基准测试CausalStep，将视频分割为因果关联单元，并采用严格的逐步问答协议，构建了基于错误类型分类的干扰选项来确保诊断价值，同时设计了七项诊断指标进行综合评估。

Result: 实验显示当前主流的开源和专有模型与人类在逐步推理能力上存在显著差距。

Conclusion: CausalStep为推动视频推理能力提供了一个严谨的基准测试工具，有助于推动研究进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文本到图像扩散模型在生成图像方面表现出色，但其存在记忆和再现训练数据的风险。现有的基于剪枝的缓解策略无法有效应对这一问题，文中提出了一种新型的对抗性微调方法以提高模型的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆化问题，以及现有缓解策略对模型鲁棒性的不足。

Method: 提出了一种新型对抗性微调方法，通过迭代搜索触发记忆再现的机制，并对模型进行更新以提高其鲁棒性。

Result: 验证了现有基于剪枝的缓解策略存在脆弱性，且记忆可以从文本嵌入空间中的不同位置触发，提出的方法显著提高了模型的稳健性。

Conclusion: 现有缓解策略无法真正消除记忆化问题，需开发能够完全移除被记忆内容的新方法。本文为构建更值得信赖和合规的生成式AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

TL;DR: S2S-ST是一种新框架，通过单一低成本的稀疏ST数据和自然图像共训练实现高准确度的ST数据插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率空间转录组数据昂贵且稀缺的问题。

Method: 提出S2S-ST框架，包含三个创新：稀疏到稀疏的自监督学习策略、与自然图像的跨域共学习以及逐步数据一致性插补网络(CDCIN)。

Result: 在乳腺癌、肝脏及淋巴组织等多种组织类型上的实验表明，该方法在插补精度上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: S2S-ST框架能通过稀疏输入实现强大的ST重建，降低对高成本数据的依赖，促进生物医学与临床应用。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然在多个领域表现出了潜力，但其在医学影像中的应用还处于初期阶段。

Method: 基于Qwen-32B架构，集成分割套件、逆向图像生成模块和评估工具开发了AURA。

Result: AURA能够通过动态交互、上下文解释和假设验证，提升医学影像分析的透明性和临床适配性。

Conclusion: 适应性和交互式AI系统如AURA能将医学影像分析从静态预测转化为决策支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced
state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual
interpretability.

works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

Conclusion: 结合正确和错误类别CAM的显著性引导训练方法能更好地提高深度学习模型的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

Abstract: In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视频字幕生成和文本存储的模型，用于通过文本化视频内容回答复杂自然语言查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容高维且紧凑的文本表示可以简化复杂视频的查询。

Method: 使用LaViLa视频字幕生成器和LLM，通过情节分段与静态场景描述改进文本生成，并开发可控混合字幕生成器。

Result: 成功细化LaViLa生成器，整合动作与场景描述，提升字幕生成的完整性与效率。

Conclusion: 开发的混合字幕生成器可依据场景变化自适应生成不同类型字幕，为复杂问题回答提供更全面数据支持。

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为VideoNarrator的新型无训练视频描述生成管道，可以生成具有严格时间戳和高质量视频内容描述的密集视频字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态大语言模型在视频时间对齐和未见场景下生成不准确叙述的问题。

Method: 提出了一种灵活的管道方法，利用现成的大语言模型和视觉语言模型作为字幕生成器、上下文提供者或字幕验证器。

Result: 实验表明此方法显著提高了视频叙述的质量与准确性，减少了虚构内容并改善了时间对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了视频理解能力，并能支持视频摘要、问答等任务，具有广告和营销等扩展应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.

Motivation: 通过小样本学习，减少手动数据标注的高昂成本，尤其在视频和3D检测中更为重要。

Method: 研究了小样本学习如何结合时间序列结构或点云网络等新方法，解决视频和3D检测中特定任务的挑战。

Result: FSL在多个领域展示了其减少标注需求的潜力，尤其在视频和3D检测中实现了高效的信息利用和标注减少。

Conclusion: 通过整合多样性的模态信息，小样本学习为实际用途提供了更低监督需求的解决方案，被证明在视频、3D及其他任务中极具应用潜力。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.

Conclusion: SDG-OCC网络通过创新的视角变换和多模态蒸馏技术，在多模态三维占用预测领域实现了技术突破，为自动驾驶场景提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

Method: 提出FedVLM框架，通过引入个性化LoRA（pLoRA），动态调整参数以适应每个客户端的独特数据分布，同时实现模型隐私保护和高效的全局模型聚合。

Result: 在RLAIF-V数据集上实验表明，pLoRA相较标准LoRA能提升客户端特定的性能24.5%，在非iid环境下有显著的适应能力优势。

Conclusion: FedVLM为在联邦环境下微调视觉语言模型提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，尤其在分布式学习的个性化适应方面具有重大意义。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each
client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation
while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard
LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a
scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning VLMs in federated settings,
advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者发现Transformer虽然对建模长距离依赖性强，但对局部运动变化的敏感性不足和缺乏归纳偏置影响了定位精度和泛化能力。本文受大型卷积核与Transformer设计启发，寻求优化惯性测距的性能。

Method: 提出了包含Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM)模块和Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU)单元的框架。DADM捕捉动态输入的全局与局部特征且高效聚合。STGU针对时序建模不足问题优化了特征提取。结合两者设计了IONext骨干网络。

Result: 通过六个公开数据集验证，IONext相比SOTA方法显著提高，例在RNIN数据集上ATE和RTE分别降低10%和12%。

Conclusion: IONext框架充分利用DADM和STGU模块，在惯性测距任务中展现卓越性能，为高精度与强泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning

EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an

demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced

proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,
with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.

Conclusion: ScSAM成功解决了亚细胞形态和分布多样性带来的偏差问题，并通过特征融合与提示机制实现了卓越的分割性能。

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的对比度增强方法在不同任务或数据集上的泛化性较差，亟需开发一种通用且高性能的方法。

Conclusion: UNICE方法提供了一种无需人工标注的对比度增强解决方案，具有显著的通用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

Conclusion: DOOMGAN显著提高了可见光谱下眼部生物特征伪造的效果，同时发布了首个全面的相关数据集，为该领域的进一步研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,

### [28] [Multi-Scale PCB Defect Detection with YOLOv8 Network Improved via Pruning and Lightweight Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17176)
*Li Pingzhen,Xu Sheng,Chen Jing,Su Chengyue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种改进的多尺度PCB缺陷检测方法，利用YOLOv8框架结合多种策略，显著提升了检测的精准度与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统PCB检测模型在高精度与实时检测上的限制，寻求提升小目标检测准确性与兼顾模型计算成本的问题。

Method: 设计了一种结合Ghost-HGNetv2结构、C2f-Faster多级特征融合、GCDetect检测头及优化的Inner-MPDIoU损失函数的模型，并利用自适应剪枝率进一步减小模型规模。

Result: 经过实验，改进后的模型在公开PCB缺陷数据集上的mAP0.5达到99.32%，mAP0.5:0.9达到75.18%，比原YOLOv8n提升了10.13%。

Conclusion: 该工作提出的新方法在速度与精度上均具备显著优势，满足高密度PCB缺陷检测的需求。

Abstract: With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.

*Linghe Meng,Jiarun Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多层次视觉评估范式，通过三阶段的特征提取、层次融合和联合聚合来提升AI生成内容质量评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法一般基于单一视觉特征，无法捕获AIGC图像中的复杂失真，为此需要一种多层次的视觉表示范式来提升质量评估能力。

Method: 提出一种三阶段的多层次视觉表示范式，包括多层次特征提取、层次化融合和联合聚合，并基于此设计了两种网络（MGLF-Net和MPEF-Net）。

Result: 通过基准测试表明，该方法在感知质量评估和文本到图像一致性任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: 多层次视觉评估范式可以有效提高AI生成内容的质量评估能力，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Vec2Face+模型，通过生成高质量的合成面部数据集，达到人脸识别训练的新高标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数方法在增加类内变化时，忽视了类内身份一致性的重要性。而确保这些特性对于生成高质量的人脸训练数据至关重要。

Method: 提出Vec2Face+生成模型，直接从图像特征生成图像。采用三个策略：1) 采样分布更好的身份；2) AttrOP算法提高属性变化；3) 基于LoRA的姿态控制，高效性保持身份一致。

Result: 生成的VFace10K数据集使得FR模型在七个真实测试集上达到SOTA。扩展到VFace100K和VFace300K规模，均在五个测试集上优于CASIA-WebFace。

Conclusion: 首次展示了合成数据集能超越真实数据集的性能。发现合成数据集在某些特定任务上表现劣势，值得研究方向。

Abstract: When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻灯片设计对非专业人士来说较为困难，现有的自动化工具缺乏自我改进能力。

Method: 将设计流程分为设计审阅者和设计贡献者两个角色，基于大语言模型进行微调，模拟中间草稿并通过引入可控扰动来教授错误和修复方法。

Result: DesignLab在实验中优于现有的设计生成方法，包括某商用工具。

Conclusion: 设计的迭代性质能产生更精美、专业的幻灯片，DesignLab的系统更能实现这一点。

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.

Abstract: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD
framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral
scans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware
supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a
large-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach
outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized
dental crown design.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.

Motivation: 目前传统的木材处理方法依赖人工，效率低下且易出错，亟需一种高效可靠的方法以解决大规模木材处理的问题。

Method: 使用YOLOv5目标检测算法，对公共数据集TimberSeg 1.0进行微调，通过检测图像中的木材边界框来估算木材直径，实验的图片来源于实际工业环境。

Result: 模型在mAP@0.5指标上达到了0.64，即使在计算资源有限的情况下也能可靠地检测木材。

Conclusion: 这种轻量化且可扩展的解决方案不仅适合现场库存管理，还可以成功集成至中小型企业的现有木材处理工作流中。

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.

Motivation: 当前的对齐方法分开训练政策模型和奖励模型，导致流程复杂且性能有限。

Method: 提出URPO框架，将指令执行和奖励建模整合在单一模型内，统一生成格式。

Result: 实验表明URPO在指令执行和推理任务中显著优于传统方法，并在奖励评估任务中超越分离的奖励模型。

Conclusion: URPO通过消除分离的奖励模型需求并促进生成和评估的协同演化，实现了更简单、更高效且更有效的语言模型对齐方式。

Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分析的方法主要基于配对图文数据或未配对图像数据进行初步学习，但单独使用其中一种数据限制了模型学习更丰富的图像特征能力。

Method: 引入半监督视觉语言预训练任务，通过引入MaskedCLIP框架，将遮挡图像建模与对比语言图像预训练相结合。同时设计桥接变换器将遮挡特征空间与CLIP特征空间相连，并通过遮挡知识蒸馏损失提取语义知识。

Result: 通过与视网膜图像分析相关的实验验证，证明该方法在数据利用效率及模型性能上有显著提升。

Conclusion: MaskedCLIP有效结合配对与未配对图像数据，在提升医学图像基础模型的特征提取能力及下游任务表现方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.

Motivation: 当前MMT方法在推理时依赖于配对的图像文本输入且易受无关视觉噪声影响，限制了其鲁棒性和实际应用性，本文旨在改善这一问题。

Method: D2P-MMT通过预训练扩散模型生成图像以替代真实图像，同时结合双分支提示策略训练模型，并使用分布对齐损失减少模态差异和训练推理偏差。

Result: 在Multi30K数据集上，D2P-MMT的翻译性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: D2P-MMT创新性地通过生成图像和双分支策略提高了MMT的鲁棒性和翻译性能，可有效应对视觉噪声的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: 利用IQA模型的特性，可以有效地将其应用于生成AI图像的检测任务，且具有广泛适应性与抗退化能力。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.

Conclusion: UEC方法在不依赖昂贵注释的情况下，实现了SOTA性能，提供了公开数据和代码，有望推动无监督曝光校正领域发展。

Abstract: Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods
[12], while utilizing only 0.01% of their parameters. Our work further
investigates the broader impact of exposure correction on downstream tasks,
including edge detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the
adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features. The source code and
dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/BeyondHeaven/uec_code.

*Asir Saadat,Syem Aziz,Shahriar Mahmud,Abdullah Ibne Masud Mahi,Sabbir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨视觉问答（VQA）模型在处理无法回答的问题时的表现，并引入了一个名为VisionTrap的数据集来测试模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前视觉问答模型在遇到无法回答的问题时是否能识别自身知识局限性，而不是生成不准确的答案。

Method: 构建了VisionTrap数据集，包含三类无法回答的问题：混合实体、不现实场景、虚构人物，并针对这些问题评估模型性能。

Result: 研究发现，模型在面对无法回答的问题时往往倾向于提供答案，而非选择放弃回答。

Conclusion: 在VQA评估中需要引入无法回答的问题，以测试模型在遇到复杂场景时能否认识到自身的局限性。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.

TL;DR: PolarAnything模型通过单张RGB图像生成高质量和物理准确的偏振图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏振相机的获取限制了偏振图像的广泛应用，需要生成真实感的偏振图像。

Method: 提出了PolarAnything框架，基于扩散生成模型并有效保留偏振特性，无需依赖3D资产。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成高质量偏振图像，同时支持如从偏振信息获取形状等任务。

Conclusion: PolarAnything在无3D资源情况下实现了高效、物理精确的偏振图像生成，推动偏振图像的广泛使用。

Abstract: Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对医学图像分割中的跨域问题提出了FA-SAM框架，解决了基于SAM的模型对手动提示依赖性强及错误提示导致掩码结果错误等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决SAM模型在跨域场景下应用中，因依赖手动提示及错误提示可能造成错误分割结果的问题，同时提升其在临床医学图像分割中的自动化适用性。

Method: 引入FA-SAM框架，包括AGM分支与SUFM模块，用于模拟浅特征的不确定性分布生成目标域提示，IPEF模块用于结合图像和提示的嵌入信息，多尺度获取全局与局部细节。

Result: 在公开的前列腺和眼底血管数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了FA-SAM的有效性并证明其在解决领域间偏差问题中的潜力。

Conclusion: FA-SAM框架能够实现医学图像分割的自动化，减轻领域偏差对分割效果的影响，并具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PointLAMA，一个高效的点云预训练框架，通过结合任务感知的点云序列化技术、混合编码器和条件扩散机制，提升了点云建模的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba模型虽然在点云建模中表现出色，但由于缺乏局部导向偏置，难以捕捉3D数据中的细粒度几何结构。

Method: PointLAMA通过采用Hilbert曲线和轴向排序进行点云序列化，设计轻量化的潜在注意力模块以增强局部上下文建模，并结合基于条件扩散的预训练机制来去噪特征序列。

Result: 实验结果表明，PointLAMA在多个基准数据集上实现了竞争性性能，同时保持了最小的参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PointLAMA有效提升了点云预训练的效率和表现，为高效的3D点云建模提供了新方案。

Abstract: Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要复杂硬件或多种传感器，难以适应现代工业动态环境。本研究旨在提出一个有效且经济的监控解决方案。

Method: 通过多个机器学习模型整合相同时间戳的状态信息，检测并确认装配流程当前阶段。

Result: 所提方法实现装配过程监控的平均准确率超过92%，并提供更好的错误检测和可视化功能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高监控精度和效率，还减少昂贵硬件依赖，是现代工业应用的更优实践选择。

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为CasP的新方法，通过分阶段逐步细化匹配过程，减少全局搜索带来的计算开销，同时提高匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前半密集特征匹配方法在准确性和效率上受限于全局搜索的高计算开销。

Method: 设计了基于级联对应先验的两阶段匹配管道，第一阶段利用区域选择的交叉注意力机制提高特征的区分性，第二阶段通过限制搜索范围实现精确的匹配。此外利用高层特征减少低层提取的计算开销。

Result: 在高分辨率场景下，CasP相比ELoFTR有2.2倍的速度提升，同时具有更好的几何估计性能和跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CasP在延迟敏感及高鲁棒性的应用（如SLAM和无人机系统）中具有巨大潜力，提供了既高效又准确的匹配方案。

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual
character animation. The project homepage is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人类重建方法存在纹理不对齐问题，不同人体部件的纹理往往混合在一起，缺乏结构一致性。本文动机是利用人体部件的分割信息来解决这一问题，并改进对单幅图像中不可见区域的纹理重建。

Method: 提出了两个主要模块：PartSegmenter模块用于从单张图像推断3D人体部件信息；PartTexturer模块将部件信息融入纹理重建，通过预训练的图像生成网络获取纹理对齐的先验知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的PARTE框架在3D人类重建质量上达到了最新的最佳水平。

Conclusion: 利用3D人类部件信息能显著改进现有3D人类重建方法中的纹理对齐问题，为后续研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以提取稳健特征，并且缺乏可靠标注，从而导致微弱目标检测成为挑战。

Method: 提出TPS框架，将检测重定义为逐像素时间信号建模问题，并开发Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet)，结合动态多尺度注意机制（DMSAttention）提升时间模式感知能力，以及基于图的轨迹挖掘策略来减少误警并确保时间一致性。

Result: 在低信噪比数据集上的实验表明，TPS框架优于最先进的方法，达到超过1000 FPS的检测速度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注即可实现高性能检测，且具备实时应用潜力。

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态轨迹预测中未能充分建模轨迹复杂的时空发展，可能导致碰撞或次优结果，因此需要更高效、更精准的运动预测及规划框架。

Method: 通过框架DeMo++引入全局运动意图和精细时空状态解耦建模，并加入跨场景轨迹交互机制；采用Attention与Mamba混合模型实现场景信息聚合和轨迹状态序列建模。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如Argoverse 2, nuScenes, nuPlan, NAVSIM）上，DeMo++均达到了最新的最优性能水平。

Conclusion: DeMo++显著提升了自动驾驶系统中运动预测和规划的安全性和效率，提供了兼顾多样性和时空动态的严密轨迹建模能力。

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Motivation: 现有多模态表示学习方法往往依赖两两对比学习及预设锚点，限制了多模态对齐的广度和稳定性，因此需要一种更加灵活且稳定的多模态联合对齐方法。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有方法相比，PMRL在不同任务上展现出了更优的性能。

Conclusion: PMRL以更加理论化的视角实现了多模态对齐的无锚点表示学习，为多模态表示学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for
assembling lightweight food image.

Conclusion: 主动学习在降低NeRF模型标注成本上是有效的，这为构建语义感知的NeRF模型提供了一种更经济的方法。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,
achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random
sampling.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合对比预训练和稀有类别感知技术，显著降低了半导体X射线显微扫描中数据标注的难度，且在实验数据集中表现出领先性能，表明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 通过引入空间多样性，结合不确定性和特征多样性等传统主动选择准则，提出一个统一的优化框架用于区域主动学习。

Result: 相比现有方法，该方法在仅标注5-9%的像素时即可达到全监督模型95%的性能，并超越所有最先进的区域主动学习方法。

Conclusion: 整合空间多样性显著提升了区域主动学习的性能，是一种高效的提升语义分割模型性能同时降低标注成本的方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all
state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic
segmentation.

*Keon-Hee Park,Seun-An Choe,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种新的源无关未知目标检测方法，称为SFUOD，能够识别已知目标和检测未知目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有源无关目标检测方法假设目标域中仅包含源域中的已定义类型目标，限制了其适用范围，因此需突破这一限制。

Method: 提出了一种名为CollaPAUL的方法，包括协同调整和基于主轴的未知标签赋予两部分。协同调整通过跨域注意力机制结合目标域辅助编码器和预训练检测器的知识，基于主轴投影和模型的置信分数为未知目标标注伪标签。

Result: 所提出的方法在SFUOD基准测试中取得了当前最优的性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究验证了CollaPAUL框架在源无关未知目标检测任务中的有效性，为跨域目标检测开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

*Peng Wu,Qiuxia Lai,Hao Fang,Guo-Sen Xie,Yilong Yin,Xiankai Lu,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件概率框架的新方法，应对组合型零样本学习（CZSL）中的属性-对象依赖性建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CZSL方法忽略了组合中的语义约束和上下文依赖性，因此需要一种能够更好捕获属性与对象之间相互依赖的新方法。

Method: 采用条件概率框架，将组合概率分解为对象的可能性和其属性的条件可能性，并通过融合文本描述提升对象特征学习，同时通过跨注意力机制优化属性学习。

Result: 在多个CZSL基准上进行的实验显示了该方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化对象可能性和属性的条件可能性，可有效捕获组合依赖性，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code
is available at here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作缺乏动态性或无条件生成，未能为临床提供有意义的参考，需改进生成框架以满足实际应用需求。

Method: 设计了自回归模型，结合时空网格帧模式(SGP)和语义感知遮蔽(SAT)，分别优化全局依赖建模和语义区域生成能力。

Result: EndoGen在生成条件引导的高质量内镜内容上表现出色，并提升了息肉分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: EndoGen通过创新性生成策略为医学成像提供了前所未有的条件视频生成能力, 提升了诊断工具的效果，可促进医疗发展。

Abstract: Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法计算量大，需要大量标注数据，实用性有限。本研究旨在通过利用预训练MLLMs解决这些限制。

Method: 提出动态层重要性探测(DLSP)机制，智能提取MLLMs中最具信息的隐藏层作为特征，结合轻量级异常检测器和时间定位模块高效检测和解释异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上，HiProbe-VAD性能优于无训练方法及大部分传统方法，并且展现了跨模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HiProbe-VAD解锁了预训练MLLMs在视频异常检测中的潜力，为更实用和可扩展的方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

Motivation: 现有部分相关视频检索方法在欧几里得空间中出现几何失真，无法有效表征视频的层次结构及语义关系，导致时间建模性能次优。

Method: 提出HLFormer框架，结合Lorentz Attention Block与Euclidean Attention Block以实现双曲与欧几里得空间的混合视频嵌入，并通过Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module动态融合特征，同时引入Partial Order Preservation Loss强化文本与视频之间的层次关系。

Result: 实验验证表明，HLFormer性能超越现有最优方法，达到了最新的研究水平。

Conclusion: HLFormer有效解决现有方法在部分相关视频检索中的短板，充分利用双曲空间增强层次建模能力，实现跨模态匹配的显著提升。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

Motivation: 当前单目物理基于人类姿态跟踪方法在相机运动或地面不平坦时效果较差，且评估数据多为无真实标签的野外视频或不完善的合成数据集。

Method: 提出MoviCam数据集，包含真实标签的动态单目相机轨迹、场景几何和3D人类运动信息；提出PhysDynPose方法，结合场景几何及物理约束，利用运动学估计与SLAM技术恢复世界坐标下的人类姿态与相机运动轨迹，并通过物理优化进一步提升姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: 本文的方法结合真实标签数据集和物理优化技术，提升了动态场景中的人类姿态与相机运动估计的准确性。

Abstract: Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

Motivation: 尽管专家混合架构在大规模视觉语言模型中表现突出，其在使用较小模型的实时开放词汇目标检测中的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 研究了浅层和深层专家协同模式，提出了一种扩展Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge为动态推理框架的Dynamic-DINO模型，其中创新包含MoE调优策略、粒度分解机制、预训练权重分配和特定路由器初始化。

Conclusion: Dynamic-DINO通过利用专家混合架构和动态推理机制在开放词汇目标检测任务上展现了显著潜力，并实现了性能突破。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.

Conclusion: 通过结合VLM生成的地理先验与视觉定位识别，可实现可扩展、鲁棒且高精度的地理定位系统。

Abstract: Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.

Motivation: 现有HOI方法需要大量人工注释数据，制作成本高，易于不一致，并且对于新领域和罕见交互的可扩展性有限，研究者希望通过视觉语言模型突破这些限制。

Method: 提出DYSCO框架，利用多模态注册表中的交互表示，结合视觉信号和创新的语义对齐技术，采用多头注意机制自适应调整视觉和文本特征的权重，从而实现鲁棒的交互理解。

Result: 实验表明，DYSCO在罕见交互场景上表现尤为出色，不仅优于现有的无需训练的模型，还与训练模型竞争效果相当。

Conclusion: DYSCO框架展示了视觉语言模型在加强HOI检测中的潜力，提供了一种有效、无需训练的方法，特别是在罕见交互理解方面效果明显。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

Conclusion: ERMV框架有效地解决了4D多视图编辑的挑战，为机器人模仿学习提供了强有力的数据增强方法。

Abstract: Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

### [69] [Probing Vision-Language Understanding through the Visual Entailment Task: promises and pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17467)
*Elena Pitta,Tom Kouwenhoven,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Visual Entailment任务在多模态语言模型中作为测试视觉-语言理解可靠性探针的能力，重点关注了LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision模型。结果显示，通过三次示例推理的表现优于零次，并且微调模型在准确率和解释评估中表现出色，但也暴露了对语言先验依赖过多等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉推理任务是否能可靠评估多模态语言模型的视觉-语言理解能力，并深入理解这些任务的可能性和局限性。

Method: 以LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision为对象，通过零-shot、少-shot及微调等设置进行实验，分析提示设计、样本数量和视觉信息对VE表现的影响，并通过基于解释的评估进一步探讨模型的推理过程。

Result: 三次示例推理优于零次示例，但继续增加例子会引入噪声；标签顺序会显著影响预测；无视觉信息时模型倾向于幻象内容；微调模型在e-SNLI-VE数据集上取得83.3%的准确率并超过SOTA模型；解释评估表现出与人类相似的语义解释能力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉推理任务的指标价值及其局限性，尤其是在模型过度依赖语言先验和视觉信息难以完全验证的情况下，并为改进多模态评估方法指明了方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

Conclusion: SRMambaV2在汽车领域的稀疏点云上采样任务中具有显著效果，并展示了其提高几何重建质量的潜力。

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

Conclusion: AnoBFN证明是一种强大的方法，结合了生成模型和贝叶斯推断的优势，在医学影像领域的异常检测中展示了显著潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Conclusion: DFDNet通过利用频域特性实现更优异的去眩光效果，具有显著的性能提升，可用于实际的夜间摄影图像处理。

Abstract: Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

Abstract: Automated X-ray inspection is crucial for efficient and unobtrusive security
screening in various public settings. However, challenges such as object
occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray
scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable
detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field,
reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently

further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation
of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is
conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed,
composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for

PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering

Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and
time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and
computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads
to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and
computational complexity analysis. To support reproducibility of the reported

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CompactFusion的框架，通过减少计算设备间的通信量，提高扩散模型的生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要大量计算资源，多加速器并行推理会因设备间的激活交换导致通信开销，限制了效率和可扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Residual Compression的残差压缩方法，仅传输压缩后的激活残差，并引入轻量级误差反馈机制以防止误差积累。

Result: 在4xL20平台上，实现了3.0倍的推理速度提升，同时生成保真度显著提高。在慢速网络上应用序列并行策略，则达到了6.7倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: CompactFusion在保持高生成质量的前提下，大幅减少了通信数据量，为扩散模型并行推理提供了一个高效可扩展的解决方案，且能轻松集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有研究很少关注压缩动态点云质量的提升，尤其是空间和时间相关性的有效利用尚未深入研究。

Method: 设计了包括基于重新着色的运动补偿模块、动态通道注意模块、高斯引导的邻域特征聚合模块及基于皮尔逊相关性的联合损失函数。

Result: 相比最新G-PCC测试模型，STQE对Luma、Cb和Cr分量分别提升了0.855 dB、0.682 dB和0.828 dB，且BD-rate分别下降了-25.2%、-31.6%和-32.5%。

Conclusion: STQE显著增强了动态点云的视觉质量，有效利用了空间与时间相关性。

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%
for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

Motivation: 解决现有方法仅利用单一预训练任务，无法有效捕捉丰富信息的问题。

Conclusion: 无需3D标注，框架可扩展至大规模数据集，编码器效果可迁移到多种下游任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

Motivation: 由于扩散模型能够从少量样本生成定制化图像，因此引发了与隐私相关的担忧，尤其是对私人内容未经授权的修改带来的风险，该工作旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HAAD和HAAD-KV两种方法，通过对扩散模型的h-space（语义潜在空间）进行对抗性扰动来降低图像生成性能。HAAD直接针对h-space制造扰动，而HAAD-KV仅针对h-space的KV参数，计算更高效。

Result: 与现有最先进的对抗攻击方法相比，这些方法表现出更好的效果。

Conclusion: HAAD和HAAD-KV方法简单高效，对扩散模型的图像生成能力形成了更强的保护。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.

Motivation: 当前硬标签攻击的挑战在于高查询成本，现有方法在梯度估计上有所欠缺，本文旨在提高查询效率并改进攻击性能。

Conclusion: 本文的方法通过结合迁移先验和优化的梯度估计显著提升了硬标签攻击的效率，是一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

Method: 提出了PRIX系统，通过视觉特征提取器结合生成式规划模块，使用全新设计的上下文感知重新校准Transformer模块（CaRT），直接从原始像素输入中预测驾驶轨迹。

Result: PRIX在NavSim和nuScenes基准上达到了最先进的性能，同时在推理速度和模型大小上相较于传统方法更具效率。

Conclusion: PRIX兼具性能与高效率，能够满足真实场景中的需求，适合广泛部署。

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RemixFusion的新方法，通过结合显式和隐式表示，实现高质量和大规模在线RGB-D重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法难以有效处理大规模场景且耗时，亟需改善其细节重建能力和时间效率。

Method: 提出基于残差的混合表示法，结合显式的TSDF网格和隐式神经模块，并加入多帧联合位姿优化与分而治之的局部移动体积设计。

Result: 本方法在大规模场景的映射和跟踪精度上超越了显式和隐式表示的当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: RemixFusion通过混合表示实现了高细节、低时间和内存开销的场景重建，为高质量相机跟踪铺平道路。

Abstract: The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出InvRGB+L模型，通过单一RGB+LiDAR序列实现大规模、可重光照、动态场景的逆渲染建模，突破了传统方法仅依赖RGB观测的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆图形方法主要依赖RGB观测，LiDAR仅用于几何信息，导致材料估计受光干扰的影响较大，因此需要利用LiDAR强度值弥补RGB方法的不足。

Method: 引入基于新物理的LiDAR光照模型和RGB-LiDAR材料一致性损失函数，结合LiDAR强度信息改进材料估计。

Result: 模型生成了具有创新视角的RGB和LiDAR渲染，包括场景重光照、夜景仿真和动态对象插入，实现了超过现有技术水平的表现。

Conclusion: InvRGB+L模型有效利用LiDAR强度信息，在城市级场景逆渲染和LiDAR模拟中达到新的技术高度，展示出模块创新应对多样化场景的潜力。

Abstract: We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR
material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR
renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night
simulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass
current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering
and LiDAR simulation.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法不仅有效提高了效率和精度，并且首次实现了从使用SD地图的模型向无SD地图模型的知识迁移。

Abstract: Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic,

devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of
\method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows
exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity

which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,
video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,
we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion
Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an
autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise
control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic
optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the
high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves
remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型在远距离、角度变换以及衣物变化等复杂环境下表现有限，因此需要一个更强大的模型提升长时间跨衣物识别性能。

Method: 基于EVA-02骨干网络，结合掩码图像建模预训练，并通过精选的转移学习协议优化模型性能。

Result: ECHO-BID在长时间跨衣物识别和遮挡场景中表现显著优于其他模型，尤其在使用小且难的数据集进行转移学习后表现更佳。

Conclusion: 选择合适的预训练骨干架构与转移学习策略是提升长时间跨视图身份识别性能的关键。

Abstract: Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct
pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can drive
substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏体素框架因注意力机制的二次扩展复杂性导致计算效率偏低，亟需一种既能优化效率又能保持生成质量的解决方案。

Method: 首先通过VecSet表征在第一阶段生成粗略的物体布局，从而减少标记数目并加速体素坐标预测；其次在第二阶段利用Part Attention引入基于几何感知的局部化注意力机制，从而限缩注意力计算范围，通过将焦点集中于语义一致的局部区域来确保结构连续性。

Result: 实验表明Ultra3D支持高分辨率（1024分辨率）3D生成，在视觉真实感和用户偏好方面均达到当前最优表现，并在潜在生成速率上提高了6.7倍。

Conclusion: Ultra3D显著提高了稀疏体素建模的效率和效果，为高效和高质量的3D生成提供了新路径，同时展示了局部化注意力机制的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类器在面对真实世界中分布外（OOD）场景的表现评估面临诸多挑战，现有基准方法无法很好模拟真实的扰动变化。

Method: 提出CNS-Bench基准，通过结合LoRA适配器和扩散模型生成具有连续严重性和多样性的扰动；还提出了有效的过滤机制提高测试可靠性。

Result: 通过此基准对40多个分类器进行了大规模测试，发现模型在不同扰动下的排名会发生变化，并且连续评估能更准确识别模型弱点。

Conclusion: CNS-Bench提供了一种更精确的OOD稳健性测量方式，有助于更好理解分类器的行为及其潜在应用场景的可靠性。

Abstract: An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

Motivation: 探索注意力矩阵的深层机制和语义相关性，改善图像分割和生成的表现。

Method: 通过将注意力矩阵建模为马尔科夫链，分析其代谢状态和稳定状态（TokenRank），并证明这些方法在分割和生成中的有效性。

Result: 实现了最先进的零样本分割，定义并验证了TokenRank在不受条件的图像生成中的改善作用。

Conclusion: 新的马尔科夫链框架为理解现代视觉Transformer中的注意力机制提供了新的视角，具有实际改进作用。

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态大语言模型在知识驱动视觉问答中受限于对单一证据的依赖，导致推理的多维度理解不足，需要一种方法弥补这一短板。

Method: 提出了一种称为Synergos-VQA的框架，结合三种证据——全局（整体场景理解）、结构性（识别关键对象）和因果性（通过反事实检验推理稳健性）——进行协同推理。

Result: 通过实验证明，Synergos-VQA在包括OK-VQA和A-OKVQA的多个基准任务上刷新了性能记录，并展示了其可直接提升多种开源多模态语言模型的能力。

Conclusion: Synergos-VQA验证了优越的框架设计比单纯扩大模型规模更能提升推理效果，表明协同融合多元证据对视觉问答任务的关键作用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

Motivation: 现有单阶段单目语义场景完成方法在复杂场景中的性能通常不理想，且受到深度估计错误的影响。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段框架，利用Masked Recurrent Network包括Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit和距离注意力投影，分别用于专注占据区域及减少投影误差。

Conclusion: MonoMRN框架有效支持了室内外场景的单目语义场景完成，并增强了模型的鲁棒性，其源代码为公开可用。

Abstract: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,
making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these
asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce
Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object
grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we
provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four
grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to
other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully
exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding
framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a
Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different
modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art
baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope
our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,
temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and
autonomy.

Abstract: With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered
significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets
and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other
autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,
the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations
collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby
facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well
as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel
cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the
well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves
perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric
and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the
resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,
providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging
cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation
methods. We hope this work paves the way for generalizable and unified 3D
perception systems across diverse and complex environments. Our Pi3DET dataset,
cross-platform benchmark suite, and annotation toolkit have been made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法如Yolo受限于固定的目标检测词汇，无法支持复杂的交通场景理解，而VLM展示了更强的理解能力，被认为有潜力应用于自动驾驶等场景。但其幻觉生成问题对安全带来了挑战，需要进一步研究。

Method: 系统评估三种先进的VLM在Waymo Open Dataset交通场景中的表现，并提出了名为BetterCheck的幻觉检测策略。

Result: 研究发现，不论是专有的还是开源的VLM都展现出出色的图像理解能力，但仍可能生成虚假的交通元素，需要通过提出的BetterCheck策略进行校正。

Conclusion: 尽管VLM在交通场景的理解中表现优异，但幻觉问题仍需应对。未来可利用本文提出的策略提高其在ADAS或ADS系统中的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

Abstract: Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.

### [96] [A Unifying Scheme for Extractive Content Selection Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16922)
*Shmuel Amar,Ori Shapira,Aviv Slobodkin,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的框架命名为IGCS，专注于NLP中的内容选择任务，提供了统一的基准和数据，并展示了迁移学习的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前内容选择任务分散在不同的模型、数据集和评估指标中，没有统一的方法和框架。

Method: 提出了IGCS框架，利用大语言模型指导内容选择；构建了统一基准IGCSBench和一个大规模合成数据集；提出了通用评估指标，并解决了推理中的问题。

Result: 迁移学习在目标任务是否有专用训练的情形下均能提高性能；研究还验证了统一基准和框架的效果。

Conclusion: IGCS框架和资源展示了在未来内容选择模型开发中的潜在效用，提供了统一的研究视角。

Abstract: A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given
source texts. Despite this shared objective, such \textit{content selection}
tasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling
approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose
\textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified
framework for such settings, where the task definition and any
instance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model.
To promote this framework, we introduce \igcsbench{}, the first unified
benchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large
generic synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection
tasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts
performance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or
not. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based
modeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall
propose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection
models. Models and datasets available at https://github.com/shmuelamar/igcs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于大型语言模型的临床决策支持工具对诊疗质量的影响，结果表明该工具显著减少了诊断和治疗错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估基于LLM的临床决策支持工具（AI Consult）在现实医疗中的潜力，尤其是减少诊疗错误。

Method: 在肯尼亚内罗毕Penda Health初级医疗网络的15家诊所开展研究，比较使用和不使用AI Consult的39,849次患者访问数据，独立医生对其进行错误评估。

Result: 使用AI Consult后，诊断错误减少16%，治疗错误减少13%。若全面使用，Penda Health每年可减少22,000次诊断错误和29,000次治疗错误。

Conclusion: LLM工具在临床中能够减少错误，提高诊疗质量。这项研究提供了负责任应用此类工具的实践框架，具有重要现实意义。

Abstract: We evaluate the impact of large language model-based clinical decision
support in live care. In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary
care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a
safety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical
decision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows,
activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a
quality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits
performed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics.
Visits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors.
Clinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer
diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the
introduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and
treatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of
clinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the
quality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was "substantial".
These results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation
and active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study
demonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to
reduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for
advancing responsible adoption.

*Shuyuan Lin,Lei Duan,Philip Hughes,Yuxuan Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 SALU 的新方法，使生成型大语言模型在回答不可回答问题时具备更强的自我意识，从而提高回答的准确性并减少幻觉内容的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话式信息检索系统难以有效处理不可回答问题，使得生成误导性或虚假内容风险较高，且依赖外部分类器的方法与生成型大语言模型缺乏一致性。

Method: 提出了 SALU 方法，通过多任务学习框架将标准问答与不可回答查询的显式放弃生成结合。另外，通过人类反馈增强的置信分数指导强化学习过程，惩罚虚假响应，奖励适当放弃行为，以提升模型自我意识。

Result: 在定制的 C-IR_Answerability 数据集实验中，SALU 在正确回答或选择放弃问题方面表现优于强基线方法，包括混合型 LLM-分类器系统。此外，人工评估表明其在事实性和适当放弃方面可靠性显著提高，同时大幅减少系统生成幻觉内容。

Conclusion: SALU 能有效避免生成不准确内容，通过提升核心模型的知识边界感知能力，在聊天型信息检索中具有优异性能，具备广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive
access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling
unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated
content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can
introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a
novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within
the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning
framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention
generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a
confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards
appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge
boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built
C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines,
including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly
answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms
SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate
abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination,
demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."

TL;DR: 本文提出了mKGQAgent，用于将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询，通过模块化和可解释的子任务实现高效处理多语言知识图谱问答（KGQA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言自然语言接口访问知识的挑战，特别是将自然语言转换为SPARQL查询以满足信息需求。

Method: 引入mKGQAgent框架，将任务分解为规划、实体链接和查询优化等模块任务，结合协调的LLM代理工作流及经验池引导的上下文学习方法。

Result: 在DBpedia和企业知识图谱问答基准（Text2SPARQL 2025挑战）中取得第一名。

Conclusion: mKGQAgent通过模块化设计和人性化推理方法，为多语言语义解析开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of
the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones.
Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific
query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform
natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior
approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or
neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the
end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the
task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular,
interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for
planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool
for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.
Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the
Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other
participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning
systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用大型语言模型在农业领域缺乏针对性和本地化，难以适应多语言环境与低资源背景。

Method: 生成农业领域的多语种合成数据集（英语、印地语、旁遮普语），并对特定语言的LLMs进行微调，同时通过多语种数据集进行模型评估。

Result: 微调后的模型在事实准确性、相关性和农业共识方面显著优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 基于合成数据和语言特定微调的策略，可有效提升LLMs在农业多语言和低资源场景下的表现，为多语言社区提供更精准的农业咨询服务。

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their
native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the
agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to
implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available
general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking
precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient
domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific
datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual
synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from
agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our
evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the
fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results
highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning
as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture,
especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate
and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful
step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for
diverse linguistic communities.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在没有显式种族标签时的隐性偏见，通过用文化代表性的名字替代国家标签，揭示了这种替代如何影响偏见及准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LLMs在现实应用中可能存在的潜在国籍相关偏见，尤其是在以名字代替显式国籍标签的情境下。

Method: 通过从Bias Benchmark for QA（BBQ）数据集中衍生出的基准测试方法，使用带有文化指示意义的名字替代显式国籍标签，分析多家主流LLM（如 OpenAI、Google、Anthropic）的偏见和准确性表现。

Result: 实验表明，小型模型准确性更低，偏见更大。例如，Claude Haiku 的偏见得分为9%，而其更大的版本Claude Sonnet仅为3.5%，且后者准确性高出117.7%。另外，小型模型在模糊上下文中保留更多错误率，例如GPT-4o-mini相较GPT-4o保留了更多错误。

Conclusion: 本文表明，LLMs中的偏见具有顽固性，这对这些模型在全球化、多样化场景中的开发和部署有深远影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit latent biases towards specific
nationalities even when explicit demographic markers are not present. In this
work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the
Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting
explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more
reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this
substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs
from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments
show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to
their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the
ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku
exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for
its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by
117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger
portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after
substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of
the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other
model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn
resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the
development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.

TL;DR: 這篇研究探索了使用大型生成語言模型（如GPT-3.5和GPT-4.5）來進行多標籤分類，以從精神科電子健康記錄中檢測與自殺性有關的因素（SrFs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解決全球健康危機中自殺相關因素早期識別的挑戰，提升臨床干預的及時性，並填補AI對自殺性研究僅作二元分類的空白。

Method: 提出了一個生成式多標籤分類（MLC）管道，利用GPT-3.5和GPT-4.5進行SrFs檢測，並引入進階評估方法如標籤集級別指標和多標籤混淆矩陣。

Result: 微調的GPT-3.5在部分匹配準確率上達到0.94，F1分數為0.91；GPT-4.5則在稀有或少數標籤集上表現更優，顯示其更平衡和穩健。

Conclusion: 此研究證明了生成式AI在處理複雜臨床分類任務中的可行性，並提供了一個結構化非結構化EHR數據的藍圖，以支持大規模臨床研究和循證醫學。

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths
annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide
attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),
including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied
AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary
classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.
This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs
from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to
end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,
including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error
analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match
accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior
performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,
indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal
systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight
the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only
demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical
classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured
EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.

TL;DR: 研究通过引入外部工具增强AI评分系统以改善复杂领域的模型反馈性能，特别是在长文本事实、数学和代码任务中表现提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于当前人类或AI评分员在面对复杂领域（如长文本事实、数学以及代码任务）时可能带有偏颇，仅依赖写作质量而非事实准确性，因此需要提升评分质量。

Method: 提出一种使用工具的代理系统，引入网络搜索和代码执行以基于外部验证实现更高质量的模型反馈，摆脱对LLM内在知识和偏见的依赖。

Result: 通过在RewardBench（包括AlpacaEval和LLMBar）、RewardMath以及3组新数据集上进行了大规模实验，结果表明，在许多情况下引入工具确实提升了表现，但并非所有情况均如此。

Conclusion: 实验表明使用外部工具能够提高部分复杂任务的响应评价性能，但同时暴露了系统对简单参数（如提示词）敏感的问题，并强调了需要改进的评分基准。

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate
and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative
model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better"
response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded
metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping
model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise
comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for
responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh
writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore
augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve
performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and
code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality
feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to
ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal
knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our
method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation
tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as
three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our
results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many,
but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity
of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved
(non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at

Motivation: 现有的文本嵌入方法因真实值特征在存储和计算效率上存在不足，存在转化为更高效的二值码表示的需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于坐标搜索的优化框架，通过为每个特征找到最优的二值化阈值，生成更准确高效的二值文本嵌入。

Result: 通过实验和统计测试验证，基于该方法生成的二值嵌入在多种NLP任务中的性能优于传统二值化方法。

Conclusion: 这种技术不仅提升NLP任务中的嵌入表示性能，还具有通用性，可应用于其他机器学习领域的特征二值化。

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language
processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are
key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations
(barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings
derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common
method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often
using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate
Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal
threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead
to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary
representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across
various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising
results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform
text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests
on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to
other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal
thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in
accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and
can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it
useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

Result: CogDual模型在CoSER、Cross-MR和LifeChoice数据集上的表现优于现有基准并展示了强大的通用性。

Conclusion: CogDual展现了将认知心理学引入角色扮演语言代理中的潜力，验证了其在生成一致和上下文对齐文本上的有效性。

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a significant
application direction for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches
typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models
to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the
underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by
cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a
\textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external
situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses
with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further
optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two
general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation.
Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and
LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing
baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在理解结构化知识时存在评估不严谨、类目单一等问题，需要一个更全面、严格的基准测试来诊断LLMs的不足之处。

Method: 通过三个阶段的流程构建SKA-Bench实例，包括问题、答案、正确信息和噪声信息，并对四种基本能力进行测试：抗噪性、顺序无关性、信息整合和负面信息排除能力。

Result: 在8个代表性LLMs（包括先进的DeepSeek-R1）上的实验证明，现有模型在结构化知识理解上仍面临相当大的挑战，其表现受噪声、顺序和幻觉现象等多种因素影响。

Conclusion: SKA-Bench展示了现有LLMs在结构化知识理解方面的不足，并为未来模型改进提供了诊断工具。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations
for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific
capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a
more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to
diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a
Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used
structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a
three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a
question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To
evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we
expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,
Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical
evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,
indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding
structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as
the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination
phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for
automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step,
multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain
underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed
to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain.
FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major
financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts,
and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels
of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and
strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot
setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of
48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial
experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five
recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial
Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These
patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the
first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to
objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

Method: 提出Moral Dilemma Dataset，该数据集包含1618个现实道德困境及人类道德判断数据，并通过一种基于Dirichlet的动态道德配置方法（DMP）改善LLMs的道德判断输出。

Result: 研究发现，模型在高共识情况下可以很好地反映人类判断，但在人类分歧较大的情况下表现不佳。另外，LLMs使用的道德价值集合较人类更为狭窄。

Conclusion: 引入的DMP方法显著提升了模型与人类价值观的对齐度（提升64.3%），增加了道德多样性，为提升LLMs道德指导的多元性和人类对齐性提供了可能。

Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice,
which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely
LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral
Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a
distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a
free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional
alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across
dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high
consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In
parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions
extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral
values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch
in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,
we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method
that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves
alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more
pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

### [109] [CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234)
*Kyeongkyu Lee,Seonghwan Yoon,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLARIFID框架，用于提高自动化放射学报告生成的诊断正确性，通过模仿专家两步工作流程在诊断效果和临床相关性上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的放射报告自动生成方法多关注语句流畅性，而忽视报告的事实准确性，并且常依赖单视图图像，限制了诊断的全面性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CLARIFID框架的核心方法包括：（1）通过部分感知预训练学习从“发现”到“结论”的逻辑流程；（2）用CheXbert F1评分作为奖励进行近端策略优化微调；（3）强制“发现”完成后再合成“结论”；（4）使用基于视觉变换器的多视图编码器融合多视图图像。推论阶段，使用推理-aware的下一步词生成策略及报告级别重排序策略。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上进行的实验表明，CLARIFID达到更高的临床效果，在标准自然语言生成和临床相关评分上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLARIFID通过模仿专家的诊断逻辑，增强了自动放射报告生成的诊断准确性和综合性，证明其在实践中具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate
radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver
clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on
producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of
the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic
comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly
optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts.
Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression
through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy
Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as
the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings"
before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views
via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a
reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level
re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings
section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent
clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing
baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored graph-based approaches to retrieval-augmented
generation, leveraging structured or semi-structured information -- such as
entities and their relations extracted from documents -- to enhance retrieval.
However, these methods are typically designed to address specific tasks, such
as multi-hop question answering and query-focused summarisation, and therefore,
there is limited evidence of their general applicability across broader
datasets. In this paper, we aim to adapt a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG
solution: $\text{GeAR}$ and explore its performance and limitations on the
SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

TL;DR: 本研究通过回归分析情感、故事性和模糊语言等主观因素在客观论点质量和主观说服力上的影响，并比较自动化注释方法对这些维度的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对论点质量的研究虽然有所进展，但缺乏以大规模分析主观因素与论点强度间关系的研究。

Method: 通过回归分析情感、故事性和模糊语言对两个标准数据集（分别标注客观论证质量和主观说服力）间影响，并评估主观特征的自动化注释方法。

Result: 结果表明，故事性和模糊语言对客观与主观论证质量的影响截然不同，而情感的影响更多取决于修辞策略而非领域。

Conclusion: 主观特征可以显著影响论点强度，本研究为理解这种复杂关系提供了新资源和独特洞见。

Abstract: In assessing argument strength, the notions of what makes a good argument are
manifold. With the broader trend towards treating subjectivity as an asset and
not a problem in NLP, new dimensions of argument quality are studied. Although
studies on individual subjective features like personal stories exist, there is
a lack of large-scale analyses of the relation between these features and
argument strength. To address this gap, we conduct regression analysis to
quantify the impact of subjective factors $-$ emotions, storytelling, and
hedging $-$ on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality
and subjective persuasion. As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level
of contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied
dimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for
each subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression
analysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the
two facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that
storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective
argument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric
utilization rather than the domain.

*Shiting Chen,Zijian Zhao,Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了增强RAG（检索增强生成）的两种新方法，特别是Confident RAG显示了显著改进并可直接应用于多个领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前RAG方法在成本较低且无需大范围参数调整的前提下用于集成外部知识，但由于不同嵌入模型和领域的异构性，导致相似度计算结果以及生成质量的差异化问题。

Method: 提出了两种增强RAG的方法：Mixture-Embedding RAG通过标准化相似度排序选择检索内容，而Confident RAG通过多次生成并选取信心度最高的输出，实现质量提升。

Result: Confident RAG相比传统RAG平均改进约5%，相比单独的LLMs改进约10%，并且在多种LLMs和嵌入模型上的结果一致。

Conclusion: Confident RAG作为一种高效的即插即用方法，能够在不同领域中实现显著的性能提升，研究代码将在发表后开放。

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various
fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or
adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered
wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an
inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort
for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model
architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different
benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity
calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To
address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by
combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding
RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects
retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;
however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG
generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then
selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average
improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,
respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models
indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various
domains. We will release our code upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经网络中的对抗性鲁棒性，尤其是递归神经网络和现代状态空间模型（SSMs，如S4），并提出了一种基于增长边界矩阵（GBM）的新正则化技术，提升模型在对抗性环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得了巨大进展，但模型仍容易受到对抗性攻击（如同义词替换）的影响，特别是对递归网络和现代状态空间模型的鲁棒性研究较为不足，因此亟需改进这些模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种基于增长边界矩阵（GBM）的正则化技术，通过降低输入扰动对模型输出的影响，提升NLP模型的鲁棒性，特别针对LSTM、S4和CNN架构进行分析与计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多个架构与基准数据集上的对抗鲁棒性提升高达8.8%，且优于多种现有的先进方法。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统性地分析了状态空间模型（如S4）的鲁棒性，同时验证了GBM方法在提升对抗攻击防御能力及文本泛化性上的有效性。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多语言本地推理挑战基准（MultiNRC），评估LLMs在法语、西班牙语和中文中的原生推理能力。分析表明，当前LLMs在多语言推理方面表现不佳（得分低于50%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言推理基准存在文化偏向（以翻译英语为主），无法全面评估LLMs在非英语环境中的实际推理能力。

Method: 构建了MultiNRC基准，包括由母语者设计的1000多个问题，涵盖语言推理、文字游戏、文化传统和数学推理等领域，同时提供英语翻译集以便比对。

Result: 实验表明，(1) 当前LLMs在多语言推理上的能力有限（低于50%）；(2) 在语言、文化和逻辑推理上表现参差不齐；(3) 数学推理英语表现显著优于其他语言（+10%）。

Conclusion: LLMs目前在多语言和文化语境中仍面临巨大挑战，需要进一步改进以提升其原生多语言推理能力。

Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on
reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual
reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains
limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed
by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks
towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this
work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a
benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and
culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,
Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:
language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition
reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition
reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English
equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation
from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can
provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.
English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14
leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent
set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native
multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs
exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and
logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math
reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating
persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Motivation: 解决当前同时口译系统在转录和翻译质量低下、实时性差、多说话人混淆、长篇翻译膨胀等方面的难题。

Method: 提出了一种新型双向语音理解与生成框架，通过大规模预训练和强化学习实现高效平衡翻译精度与延迟的系统。

Result: 实验显示，Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 达到70%以上的复杂场景翻译正确率，比商用系统在翻译质量上显著提升，并将语音克隆延迟降低至近实时的3秒。

Conclusion: Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 是一个高性能的产品化解决方案，成功实现了实时翻译的准确性与延迟之间的最佳平衡，大幅提升其实用性。

Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting
frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems
long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation
quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and
translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study,
we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers
high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning
capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret
2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech
understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that
through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves
a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency,
validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios.
Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by
significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency
of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is
around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.

Motivation: 为了应对非洲2300多种语言缺乏语音技术支持的现状，通过构建大规模合成语音数据推动ASR发展。

Method: 采用三步式流程：包括借助大语言模型(LLM)生成文本，文本到语音转换(TTS)生成语音，以及ASR微调训练，并进行广泛评估和实验。

Result: 其中8种语言的可读性得分超出5分(满分7分)；利用合成数据生成了2500小时的语料，仅为真实数据成本的1%；某些低资源语言的WER改善了相对6.5%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合真实与合成数据可以有效提升非常低资源语言的ASR性能，并揭示了数据评估的改进需求。所有数据和模型公开发布，为进一步研究提供帮助。

Abstract: Speech technology remains out of reach for most of the over 2300 languages in
Africa. We present the first systematic assessment of large-scale synthetic
voice corpora for African ASR. We apply a three-step process: LLM-driven text
creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Eight out of ten languages
for which we create synthetic text achieved readability scores above 5 out of
7. We evaluated ASR improvement for three (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa) and created
more than 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% of the cost of real
data. Fine-tuned Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models trained on 250h real and 250h
synthetic Hausa matched a 500h real-data-only baseline, while 579h real and
450h to 993h synthetic data created the best performance. We also present
gender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource
languages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2
real-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on
some evaluation data, but not on others. Investigating intercoder reliability,
ASR errors and evaluation datasets revealed the need for more robust reviewer
protocols and more accurate evaluation data. All data and models are publicly
released to invite further work to improve synthetic data for African
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型结构复杂，计算成本高昂，现有的早退算法存在中间层与输出层失配导致的精度损失问题。

Method: 提出SPADE解码方法，对中间层表示与输出层进行对齐，同时通过训练SPADE的线性近似模型优化退出决策过程。

Result: 通过结合SPADE和改进的早退算法有效降低推理成本，同时保持较高的输出精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够高效地在实际场景中部署大型语言模型，实现计算成本与输出质量的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep
structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain
sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development
of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation
at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance
due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that
lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE
(SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate
layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced
sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further
optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear
approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting
them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence
levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate
high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs
without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for
deploying large language models in real-world applications.

Result: WSM在多个基准测试中超过了传统WSD方法，带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: WSM框架展示了其在长时间模型优化中的潜力，并优于传统的学习率衰减方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the
effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay
phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have
emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present
Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal
connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a
unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including
cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model
averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization
methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training
window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model
performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge
quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted
Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving
significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on
MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning
scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

TL;DR: 本研究利用零样本大语言模型（LLMs）进行跨语言的负面竞选分类分析，揭示了欧洲各国政党在推特中的负面信息传播模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 负面竞选是政治竞争中的核心特征，但现有研究方法昂贵且难以扩展，因此需要开发新的跨语言分类技术。

Method: 引入零样本大语言模型（LLMs），在10种语言的基准数据集上验证其分类准确性，并应用于分析19个欧洲国家的议会议员在2017年至2022年间发布的1800万条推文。

Result: 研究显示，执政党较少使用负面信息，而意识形态极端和民粹主义政党（特别是右翼激进派）更多使用负面宣传。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLMs在政治传播研究中的潜力，能够实现大规模、透明且可重复的跨语言和跨文化分析。

Abstract: Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet
empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of
existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First,
it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for
cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets
in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with
native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine
learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the
largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18
million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017
and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing
parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme
and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in
significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our
understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication
in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of
LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political
communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Efficiency Leverage (EL)的新指标，用以量化Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型的计算效率，利用超过300个模型的实验，提出了一个统一的缩放定律来预测MoE架构的EL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效地预测MoE模型配置对模型能力的影响。

Method: 通过定义EL这一指标，进行大规模实验观察其与MoE配置之间的关系，提出并验证缩放定律。

Result: 验证实验表明，MoE模型的EL主要受专家激活率和总计算预算的影响，而专家粒度为非线性调节因子，提出的缩放定律能准确预测EL。

Conclusion: 研究为高效MoE模型的扩展提供了原则性和实验验证的基础，表明其可在较小参数下实现与大型密集模型相似的性能且具显著计算优势。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large
Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from
computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:
predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert
activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address
this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the
computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a
large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to
systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural
configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the
expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following
predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator
with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified
scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its
configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained
Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active
parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an
identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance
of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,
thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a
principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE
models.

Method: 数据集包含信息检索型问题，每个问题与一整篇可能包含答案的文章配对，用于评估模型从大文本中提取答案的能力，并提供基准模型性能。

Result: 提出了适用于10种语言的问答数据集，收集了高质量的大文本对问题，从而推动更复杂上下文下的模型研究。

Conclusion: 通过直接于各语言收集数据，避免了文化差异导致的问题，并提供基准模型和公开数据启发社区改进。

Abstract: We present TyDi QA-WANA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 28K
examples divided among 10 language varieties of western Asia and northern
Africa. The data collection process was designed to elicit information-seeking
questions, where the asker is genuinely curious to know the answer. Each
question in paired with an entire article that may or may not contain the
answer; the relatively large size of the articles results in a task suitable
for evaluating models' abilities to utilize large text contexts in answering
questions. Furthermore, the data was collected directly in each language
variety, without the use of translation, in order to avoid issues of cultural
relevance. We present performance of two baseline models, and release our code
and data to facilitate further improvement by the research community.

*Karen Zhou,John Giorgi,Pranav Mani,Peng Xu,Davis Liang,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种由用户反馈衍生出的清单，用于评估生成的临床笔记质量，并展示了其在覆盖率、多样性和预测能力方面的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成的临床笔记在医疗领域的应用增加，评估其质量成为一大挑战，现有自动化指标往往不能满足医生的实际需求。

Method: 提出一种基于用户反馈系统提取并生成的、有解释性且由大型语言模型评估的清单管道，用于评估AI生成的临床笔记质量。

Result: 通过对超过21,000个临床案例的去标识化数据进行离线评估，证明该清单在覆盖性、多样性和预测能力上优于现有方法，并与临床医生的偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: 该清单方法不仅能稳健识别低质量笔记，还具有实际应用价值，推动了AI生成笔记质量评估的新方法论。

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but
evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and
limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to
align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a
pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured
checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be
interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based
evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,
prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI
medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms
baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and
predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the
checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant
alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation
methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify
notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种基于人工智能的电话调查系统，利用大语言模型、语音识别和语音合成技术，为定量研究提供了一种新方式，解决了传统语音调查交互不足的问题，并通过试验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语音技术使得研究人员能够通过AI电话调查扩大定量研究的规模，同时保持与人类互动的自然性和方法学的严谨性。

Method: 论文基于大语言模型（LLM）、语音识别（ASR）和语音合成技术构建了AI电话调查系统，该系统严格遵循研究最佳实践，如问题和答案顺序随机化、问题表述的准确性等，并通过两个实验性调查和后续的人类调查评估其有效性。

Conclusion: AI电话调查系统展示了其在实现高效和自然的定量研究中的潜力，为未来基于AI技术的调查研究提供了实践经验和改进方向。

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI
telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can
scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like
interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used
interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI
enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust
to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on
large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech
synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative
research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order
randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot
surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate
human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three
key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent
satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more
responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three
metrics studied.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Megrez2，一种优化为设备原生部署的轻量级高性能语言模型架构，具有跨层共享专家模块机制和预门控路由能力，实现了高效性与准确性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型在性能和可部署性之间存在权衡，难以直接应用于受限资源环境中，亟需一种既高效又高性能的模型架构。

Method: 引入跨层专家共享机制，通过在相邻Transformer层之间重用专家模块减少参数量；同时结合预门控路由以提升加载效率和推理速度。

Result: Megrez2-Preview在5万亿token语料库上预训练，并结合监督微调与强化学习优化。尽管仅激活3B参数，总参数为7.5B，其在语言理解、指令跟随、数学推理及代码生成等任务上与更大模型同等甚至更优。

Conclusion: Megrez2架构在准确性、效率及可部署性之间实现了有效平衡，是面向资源受限实际应用的高潜力选择。

Abstract: We present Megrez2, a novel lightweight and high-performance language model
architecture optimized for device native deployment. Megrez2 introduces a novel
cross-layer expert sharing mechanism, which significantly reduces total
parameter count by reusing expert modules across adjacent transformer layers
while maintaining most of the model's capacity. It also incorporates pre-gated
routing, enabling memory-efficient expert loading and faster inference. As the
first instantiation of the Megrez2 architecture, we introduce the
Megrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and
further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. With only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters,
Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to
larger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding,
instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. These
results highlight the effectiveness of the Megrez2 architecture to achieve a
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it a strong
candidate for real-world, resource-constrained applications.

### [126] [Pretraining on the Test Set Is No Longer All You Need: A Debate-Driven Approach to QA Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17747)
*Linbo Cao,Jinman Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于辩论机制的QA评估方法，通过模型之间的辩论评估语言模型推理能力并减小记忆化和数据污染影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决当前QA测试中数据污染、记忆化以及数据集成本问题，同时提供一种更能评估模型推理能力的框架。

Method: 提出一种辩论驱动的评估方法，将QA数据集转化为通过模型辩论展开的结构化评估，包含一个答辩模型、一个辩驳模型及一个无偏裁判模型。

Result: 验证了该方法在减少数据污染、限制浅层记忆化方面的有效性，并通过实验展示了模型在辩论中的表现差异及评估方法的经济性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为衡量高级语言模型的推理能力提供了一种有效方法，强调仅依靠预训练测试集的方法已不再足够。

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks,
concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset
creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that
transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where
one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and
defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the
correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach
substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet
reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:
(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based
assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's
effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized
protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of
the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model
fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)
but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can
reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based
evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a
fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework
underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need,"
offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of
advanced language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种革命性的生命周期评估（LCA）方法，通过多模态AI代理来快速、高效地计算电子设备的碳排放，并大幅缩短专家评估时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LCA所需的数据经常缺失，传统方法在评估从生产到废弃过程中的环境影响时效率低下，无法满足日益增长的可持续性需求。

Method: 引入多模态AI代理，通过自定义数据抽象和软件工具，从在线文本和图像数据中提取信息，快速生成详细的生命周期清单，估算电子产品的“摇篮到工厂”碳排放。

Result: 新方法将专家数据处理时间从数周减少到不到1分钟，碳足迹估算误差控制在19%以内，同时开发了通过机器学习直接估算环境影响和数据驱动的排放因子生成方法，显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提升了LCA的效率和准确性，还有助于解决数据缺失问题，未来或将对LCA工作流程产生深远影响。

Abstract: Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However,
the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and
processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts
(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing
multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and
stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the
cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI
agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom
data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text
and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach
reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data
availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of
expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to
directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with
similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop
with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven
method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown
material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar
materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,
this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this
approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.

*Shao-Hung Chan,Thomy Phan,Jiaoyang Li,Sven Koenig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了多代理路径规划问题中的一种改进算法，通过新的冲突分配机制提高效率和解决路径成本超过上界的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在解决多代理路径规划问题时，因灵活分配机制导致效率降低，因此需改进以提高性能。

Method: 提出基于冲突的灵活分配、基于延迟的灵活分配，并结合两者形成混合策略的冲突分配，以改进EECBS算法。

Result: 新提出的灵活分配机制在理论上实现了完整性和有界次优性，并通过实验证明其性能优于原有的贪婪分配机制。

Conclusion: 基于提出的改进策略，EECBS算法在处理多代理路径规划问题上具有更高效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of
collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective
is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent
is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.
Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for
bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a
user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and
a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of
paths whose SOC is at most $w \cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve
collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its
optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually
bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower
bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up
EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though
EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,
increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \cdot LB$, forcing EECBS
to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a
particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,
we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion
to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy
constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we
propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical
framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is
complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches
outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.

*Yihao Xue,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过使用LoRA进行安全精调，可以在不牺牲大模型推理能力的情况下有效保证其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在安全对齐精调时避免推理能力下降的问题，即减轻“安全税”对模型性能的影响。

Method: 利用LoRA技术进行精调，将安全权重更新限制在低秩空间，从而减少对推理权重的干扰，同时尝试通过正则化和权重合并优化权重更新。

Result: 实验表明，LoRA能够在确保推理能力不下降的前提下，生成具有与全模型精调相当的安全性的大型语言模型。

Conclusion: LoRA是一种有效的方式，可以在推理能力和安全对齐之间取得良好的平衡，为未来设计推理-安全权衡的改进方法提供了启发。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex
problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with
harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the
post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been
shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the
"Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets
effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning
capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a
low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our
extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding
show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels
comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with
smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We
also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or
during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope
this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent
improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.

Motivation: 近年来，人工智能在自动驾驶和机器人等安全关键领域的重要性日益增长，而传统的安全分析方法难以适应现代E2E单块架构的复杂性。

Method: 文中回顾了不同的架构解决方案，并评估了常见安全分析方法如FMEA和FTA的有效性，并通过适配改进，提出了一种混合框架——HySAFE-AI。

Result: 研究显示，传统的安全分析方法可以通过适应AI模型的复杂性（如潜在表示的形成和利用）被显著改进。

Conclusion: 为了确保AI系统的安全性，传统的方法需要结合新的框架适应现代AI架构，并提出进一步改进AI安全标准的建议。

Abstract: AI has become integral to safety-critical areas like autonomous driving
systems (ADS) and robotics. The architecture of recent autonomous systems are
trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large
language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we
review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of
common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and
fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the
intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and
utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety
Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts
traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer
hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety
standards.

TL;DR: 研究首次利用图表问题推理（GPR）提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，并引入第一个用于GPR大规模训练的GraphPile数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在新颖复杂问题上的表现较弱，而领域特定的持续预训练方法虽有效，但缺乏广泛的可转移性。

Method: 通过引入图表问题推理（GPR）和GraphPile数据集，对LLMs进行持续预训练以改善其推理能力。GraphPile包含23种图形任务的10.9十亿标记数据，包括链式思维、程序化思维等模式。

Result: 在数学推理上提高了4.9%的准确率，在逻辑和常识推理等非数学任务上提升了21.2%。

Conclusion: 首次利用GPR提升推理模式，并通过GraphPile填补领域预训练与通用推理能力间的空白，增强了LLMs的适应性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks,
yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems.
Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for
mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader
reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning
(GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks,
spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological
reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them
ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce
GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR
data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes
chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph
data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and
3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in
mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical
reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first
to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first
dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific
pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability
and robustness of LLMs.

Motivation: 解决语言模型代理因继承大型语言模型问题（如无状态性、对提示敏感等）而导致身份丧失，影响其可识别性和可靠性的挑战。

Method: 提出一种统计驱动的经验性框架——AIE，用于评估LMA的身份保持能力，包含一系列新颖指标，并可与其他性能和鲁棒性评估结合。

Result: 成功定义和展示了如何在LMA整个生命周期中应用这些指标及框架。

Conclusion: AIE框架可以指导更优化的LMA设计（如存储和工具），提高其信任度和实用性。

Abstract: Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents
(LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time.
However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs)
(statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and
linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability,
continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode
their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their
agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these
challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous,
statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an
LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including
their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations.
AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of
performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of
optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out
formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA
life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

Abstract: Building on prior research on Generative AI (GenAI) and related tools for

to support novice learners. SCRIPT allows for open-ended interactions and
structured guidance through predefined prompts. We evaluated the tool via an
experiment with 136 students from an introductory programming course at a large
German university and analyzed how students interacted with SCRIPT while
solving programming tasks with a focus on their feedback preferences. The
results reveal that students' feedback requests seem to follow a specific
sequence. Moreover, the chatbot responses aligned well with students' requested
feedback types (in 75%), and it adhered to the system prompt constraints. These
insights inform the design of GenAI-based learning support systems and
highlight challenges in balancing guidance and flexibility in AI-assisted

TL;DR: 本文提出了Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA)，一种旨在提高企业环境中人员日常合规任务效率的对话型AI助手，通过设计智能查询路由器实现高质量响应与低延迟的平衡。实验显示CBA在多项关键指标上显著优于普通LLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在企业合规任务中，存在效率低下和任务复杂性高的问题。本研究旨在通过引入CBA，提升处理此类任务的效率，同时确保响应质量与处理速度的平衡。

Method: 采用智能查询路由器，根据请求复杂度在快速通道模式和全代理模式间切换处理，以实现优化。从而构建复合型的AI系统来完成不同复杂度的任务。

Result: 实验显示CBA在关键信息匹配率（83.7% vs. 41.7%）和LLM评估通过率（82.0% vs. 20.0%）等指标上显著优于普通LLM，并验证了智能路由机制的有效性。

Conclusion: CBA优化了处理企业合规任务的效率与效果，其路由机制在响应质量和处理速度之间达成了良好的平衡，这为相关AI技术的开发提供了新的思路。

Abstract: This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational,
agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks
for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between
response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can
intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that
only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and
(ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite
actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various
compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating
requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its
description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to
query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.
  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on
various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various
personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's
performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and
LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full
routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and
found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the
run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the
routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

Abstract: Precise modeling of microscopic vehicle trajectories is critical for traffic

Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world

performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity,
and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain
shift without simulation.

### [137] [An Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17477)
*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UDASA的不确定性驱动自适应自对齐框架，旨在在未经人工注释的情况下提升大语言模型的对齐度，并展示了其在多个任务上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工大量参与的标注对齐策略成本高且不易推广，因此寻求一种自动化、无需人工干预的对齐方法是研究的主要动机。

Method: UDASA框架根据模型对输入生成的多种输出的不确定性（语义、事实性和价值对齐）评分，构建偏好对和样本分类（保守、中等、探索），并通过逐步优化的方式提高模型对齐性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，与现有方法相比，UDASA在无害性、实用性、真实度和情感控制生成等多个任务上表现更佳，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: UDASA通过自动化框架在不用人工注释的情况下显著改善了语言模型的对齐度，为高效对齐提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
instruction following and general-purpose reasoning. However, achieving
high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human
annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an
Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to
improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates
multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across
three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these
uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes
training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory,
according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized
progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of
preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong
empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that
UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including
harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation,
significantly improving model performance.

*Luca Salvatore Lorello,Nikolaos Manginas,Marco Lippi,Stefano Melacci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文提出了LTLZinc，这是一个评估神经符号与持续学习方法在时间和约束驱动维度上的基准框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号AI大多关注静态场景，而对时间维度推理的研究较少。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了LTLZinc框架，它通过线性时序逻辑规范生成包含时间推理和持续学习任务的数据集，并结合图像分类任务提供细粒度注释。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有方法在时间学习和推理问题上的表现仍有限。

Conclusion: LTLZinc为神经符号和持续学习研究提供了新的工具，希望推动统一的时间学习与推理框架的研究。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures
with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable
formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge
over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned
concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial
intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting
where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom
explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can
be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against
which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the
temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive
temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic
specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification
datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic
training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six
neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks
generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning
and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods.
We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the
neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering
research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.

Motivation: 旨在探索如何通过引入认知依赖（EDs）和最优GA审查者的概念来提高CQE框架中的信息安全与计算效率。

Method: 提出一种基于交集的查询处理方法，针对布尔联合析取查询进行分析，并开发了首个适用于DL-Lite_R本体的重写算法。

Conclusion: 采用文中提出的方法不仅确保了强安全性，还具有良好的计算性能，显示出在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies, where
information disclosure is regulated by epistemic dependencies (EDs), a family
of logical rules recently proposed for the CQE framework. In particular, we
combine EDs with the notion of optimal GA censors, i.e. maximal sets of ground
atoms that are entailed by the ontology and can be safely revealed. We focus on
answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs) with respect to the
intersection of all optimal GA censors - an approach that has been shown in
other contexts to ensure strong security guarantees with favorable
computational behavior. First, we characterize the security of this
intersection-based approach and identify a class of EDs (namely, full EDs) for
which it remains safe. Then, for a subclass of EDs and for DL-Lite_R
ontologies, we show that answering BUCQs in the above CQE semantics is in AC^0
in data complexity by presenting a suitable, detailed first-order rewriting
algorithm. Finally, we report on experiments conducted in two different
evaluation scenarios, showing the practical feasibility of our rewriting
function.

Abstract: The grounding bottleneck poses one of the key challenges that hinders the
widespread adoption of Answer Set Programming in industry. Hybrid Grounding is
a step in alleviating the bottleneck by combining the strength of standard
bottom-up grounding with recently proposed techniques where rule bodies are
decoupled during grounding. However, it has remained unclear when hybrid
grounding shall use body-decoupled grounding and when to use standard bottom-up
grounding. In this paper, we address this issue by developing automated hybrid
grounding: we introduce a splitting algorithm based on data-structural
heuristics that detects when to use body-decoupled grounding and when standard
grounding is beneficial. We base our heuristics on the structure of rules and
an estimation procedure that incorporates the data of the instance. The
experiments conducted on our prototypical implementation demonstrate promising
results, which show an improvement on hard-to-ground scenarios, whereas on
hard-to-solve instances we approach state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究侧重于单一推理领域，但现实世界的推理需求通常需要多领域认知能力的整合，而这些领域间的相互作用尚不清楚。

Method: 本文通过系统研究，采用GRPO算法和Qwen-2.5-7B模型，对单一领域和跨领域训练的效果进行了评估，并分析了RL中的SFT和奖励设计、课程学习等策略对推理性能的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了领域间相互作用的动态，发现影响推理性能的关键因素，同时对提升多领域推理能力提供了重要指导。

Conclusion: 通过优化强化学习方法，可以有效促进大型语言模型的全面多领域推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing
research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as
mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real
world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of
multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning
skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this
gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the
RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a
comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO
algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the
models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities
when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the
intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge
during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence
of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base
and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we
delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts
of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and
language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer
significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing
key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning
performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL
methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在开发一种工具，帮助AI系统进行自我评估，符合AI Act的要求，特别是在法律风险评估方面。

Method: 采用两步法，包括预筛选和评估阶段，并通过系统输出风险级别以及相关法律条文以帮助合规。

Result: 通过定性评估，该工具在多个实际案例中表现出可预测的风险评估能力，同时能检索相关法律条文。

Conclusion: 该工具能够有效实现AI系统法律风险评估和合规指导，尤其是针对高风险系统，表现出合理性和可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool
with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI
assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI
Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment
phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the
risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time
retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their
obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields
promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant
articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of
results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting
of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring
careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.

TL;DR: 本文提出了专注于眼科学的多模态大型语言模型FundusExpert及其专用数据集FundusGen，显著提升了眼科问答和报告生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态语言模型在眼科领域面临标注粒度碎片化和临床推理逻辑不一致的问题，阻碍了模型的跨模态理解能力。

Method: 设计了一个智能系统Fundus-Engine，整合了全球疾病分类、本地目标检测和细粒度特征分析，并通过临床认知链引导模型生成可解释性推理路径；同时，通过FundusGen数据集的指令调优开发出FundusExpert模型。

Result: FundusExpert在眼科问答的准确率比MedRegA提升26.6%，在零样本报告生成任务中临床一致性达到77.0%，远超GPT-4o的47.6%。

Conclusion: 通过结合区域定位与诊断推理路径，FundusExpert实现了高效的临床对齐，开启了视觉-语言跨模态模型临床应用的新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in
the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the
intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and
leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable
reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,
achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with
diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned
MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific
MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种名为HoPeS的建模框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟不同利益相关者的视角，帮助用户体验和反思这些视角间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决理解社会生态系统过程中难以获取多样利益相关者视角的问题，为用户提供一种模拟探索不同视角的工具。

Method: 开发HoPeS建模框架，让用户通过代理角色（由大型语言模型驱动）体验不同视角，结合“模拟协议”支持用户进行反思和整合，同时开发了一个原型系统来展示其在研究机构动态和土地使用变化中的应用。

Result: 实验表明，尽管研究者提出了技术上合理的政策建议，但由于利益相关者之间的不同诉求，建议与实际政策实施之间依然存在差距，这模拟了研究者与政策制定者视角间的现实不一致。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了在社会生态模拟中探索不同视角的潜力，并有望通过进一步的优化促进学科间的合作。

Abstract: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse
stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable
alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder
perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)
modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models
(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles
to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a
"scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting
users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across
perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the
context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both
narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a
user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher
- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform
evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various
institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound
policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and
implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world
misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's
reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment
as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political
neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user
exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing
strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different
perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new
forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

Motivation: 探索将LLM与优化算法结合，促进从专用AI到具备广泛推理能力的人工通用智能（AGI）网络的转型，以更高效地管理和优化6G网络中的多样化功能。

Method: 提出了一种结合LLM与输入、输出优化器的代理框架，设计并实现了两种代理：无线接入网络（RAN）优化器和服务级协议（SLA）多代理协商器，并提出了支持AGI网络的端到端架构，在5G测试平台上进行了性能评估。

Result: 与单一LLM代理相比，提出的框架减少了5倍决策错误；较小的语言模型实现了类似精度，同时显著降低GPU资源开销（99.9%）和决策延迟（82ms）；在资源分配和SLA协商中显著优化，RAN过度利用率降低44%。

Conclusion: 提出的可信AI代理框架为下一代AGI驱动的网络系统奠定了基础，显示出适应性强、高效且可信的特点，并提供了开源实现以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a
vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time
decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users.
This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach,
where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to
artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess
broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with
real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic
agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty
steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers
supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and
implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,
and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We
further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on
a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show
that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone
LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy
with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of
82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world
testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and
resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.
Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the
symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven
networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even
as LLMs advance.

Motivation: 尽管LRMs被设计用于通过逐步推理解决复杂任务，但有研究显示其实际推理能力未必占优，此工作重新审视这一观点并探讨工具加入是否改善表现。

Method: 选择Python解释器和笔记本（scratchpads）作为工具，测试3种代表性LLMs及其LRM版本在Apple基准推理难题上的表现，比较工具增强与非增强模型的推理能力。

Result: 引入工具后，LRMs在低至高复杂性任务上均优于无需推理的模型，证明工具能够显著提升其推理能力。

Conclusion: 工具增强推理模型有助解决复杂难题，否定了关于推理无效的近期观点，展示了LRMs在工具帮助下的潜力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large
language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a
step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle
complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g.,
[Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not
actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning
actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we
revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist
when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools,
Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and
their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show
that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the
recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of
tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.

Abstract: Research communities have developed benchmark datasets across domains to
compare the performance of algorithms and techniques However, tracking the
progress in these research areas is not easy, as publications appear in
different venues at the same time, and many of them claim to represent the
state-of-the-art. To address this, research communities often organise periodic
competitions to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and techniques,
thereby tracking advancements in the field. However, these competitions pose a
significant operational burden. The organisers must manage and evaluate a large
volume of submissions. Furthermore, participants typically develop their
solutions in diverse environments, leading to compatibility issues during the
evaluation of their submissions. This paper presents an online competition
system that automates the submission and evaluation process for a competition.
The competition system allows organisers to manage large numbers of submissions
efficiently, utilising isolated environments to evaluate submissions. This
system has already been used successfully for several competitions, including
the Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners
competition.

Abstract: The quality of a transtibial prosthetic socket depends on the prosthetist's
skills and expertise, as the fitting is performed manually. This study
investigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help
standardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were
collected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data
consists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a
corresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data
pre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and
optionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.
Afterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural
network, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final
socket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the
socket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's
performance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the
AI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.
First, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface
error between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.
Second, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are
utilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the
required adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.
The random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest
error with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first
quartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence,
with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making
in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in
enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term
rewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks
due to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state
representations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer
architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these
challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic
Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages
hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present
theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that
include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL
with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by
(32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by
(16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in
reinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that
involve hierarchical structures.

Conclusion: DiffCarl是一种实用且前瞻性的解决方案，设计灵活，可适应不同系统配置和目标，支持动态能源系统中的实际部署。

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware
reinforcement learning algorithm for intelligent operation of multi-microgrid
systems. With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system
complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time
energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a
diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable
adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon
emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a
denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and
enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid
environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms
classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower
operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of
its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results
highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible
design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and
objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.

Abstract: Probabilistic encoding introduces Gaussian noise into neural networks,
enabling a smooth transition from deterministic to uncertain states and
enhancing generalization ability. However, the randomness of Gaussian noise
distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE)
method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning.
Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First,
we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations,
ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification
tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance
regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2
regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is
model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification
tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and
generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.

Abstract: Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art
performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative
sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or
one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps
noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by
enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous
velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a
limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first
principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite
integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term
Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential
relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals
without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we
introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic
consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the
differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit
of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This
establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning
average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is
significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,
resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware
compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been
successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as
Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency,
model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience
at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss
of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring
mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we
demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that,
with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms
the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern
benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily
generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to
activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional
operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

Abstract: Rehabilitation technology is a natural setting to study the shared learning
and decision-making of human and machine agents. In this work, we explore the
use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control
strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy
for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of
biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down
the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level
framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for
providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the
continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal
abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors,
including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated
two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy
network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control
system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As
a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs
increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were
seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns,
terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This
suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during
uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified.
This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the
future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and
traversing across different walking environments.

Conclusion: 通过有效地整合偏倚特征和不变表示，新框架在处理域外分布挑战时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Most existing methods for adapting models to out-of-distribution (OOD)
domains rely on invariant representation learning to eliminate the influence of
biased features. However, should bias always be eliminated -- and if not, when
should it be retained, and how can it be leveraged? To address these questions,
we first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under
which biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on
this theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically
leverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The
framework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and
indirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive
ingredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the
environmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware
predictors to alleviate environment gaps. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic datasets and standard domain generalization
benchmarks. Results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, underscoring its robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification and inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) are central to a wide range of scientific and
engineering applications. In this second part of a two part series, we extend
Bilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) for PDE-constrained optimization
problems developed in Part 1 to the Bayesian inference framework. At the lower
level, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by
minimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural
network. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior
distribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with
existing methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the
challenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights
and does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network
solution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the
PDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method
improves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty
quantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC
sampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact
minimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between
the tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the
resulting uncertainty quantification. Through numerical experiments across a
variety of PDE models, we demonstrate that our method delivers accurate
inference and quantification of uncertainties while maintaining high
computational efficiency.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal
policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability
and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains.
Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL
policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to
large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when
using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from
the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an
interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which
is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural
grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures
interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered
controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable
off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development
standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical
judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid
arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this
framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives
to those obtained via offline RL.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows,
especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models
(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of
examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic
data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent
retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows
via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no
parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,
introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity
of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a
person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three
foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four
baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate
statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.
Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.
LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at
1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly
vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and
GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three
zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary
statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up
to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a
practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.

its applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare,
energy optimization, and autonomous driving. However, a critical question
remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While
existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation
enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap
regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios
specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based
defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances
the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our
ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213%
increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82%
decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all
standalone defense strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于环境变化和传感器老化，传感器漂移影响了电子鼻系统在实际应用中的性能，需要可靠的策略来补偿漂移。

Method: 设计了两个领域适配任务，并测试了知识蒸馏（KD）、领域正则化分量分析（DRCA）及其混合方法（三种方法）在传感器漂移补偿中的表现。

Result: KD方法在漂移补偿中表现最佳，实现了高达18%准确率和15%的F1分数改进，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: KD首次成功应用于电子鼻漂移补偿，并显著增强了实用环境中传感器漂移补偿的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the
performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world
deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset
reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical
experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing
class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift
compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation
tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to
predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and
predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous
training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three
methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark
method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method
KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed
that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18%
improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior
effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for
electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift
compensation in real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一阶方法需要成本、约束等的梯度计算，并且多聚焦于离散时间系统，对于连续时间的约束问题关注不足，研究目标在于解决这些问题。

Method: 基于零阶随机矩阵搜索的ZORMS-LfD方法，可用于在不依赖损失函数平滑性的前提下，学习优化控制问题的约束与动态。

Result: 在多个基准问题中，其在学习损失与计算时间上均优于现有方法。在连续时间无约束问题上，减少了超80%的计算时间；在有约束问题中优于常用的Nelder-Mead方法。

Conclusion: ZORMS-LfD方法高效且通用，为连续时间的约束最优控制问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations
(ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of
constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to
be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the
learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order
methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs,
constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls
and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time,
with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention.
We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across
a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark
problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art
first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On
constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized
state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used
gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大模型微调过程中是否需要更新所有参数，以及微调后的更新模式。

Method: 通过实验分析多种 RL 算法（如 PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME）及模型族（如 OpenAI 和开源模型）的微调参数变化和稀疏性特征。

Result: RL 微调主要影响小部分权重，且跨数据集和算法的子网络更新高度一致，可用稀疏子网络恢复完整性能。

Conclusion: RL 不需要大规模参数更新，其训练集中于少量关键子网络，为更高效的调整方法和模型稀疏性研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large
language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is
often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's
parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL
fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of
weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced
parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity
constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,
Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show
substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far
exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the
pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers
full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully
fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL
operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted
changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited
effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts
models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,
consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods
and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine learning that uses
probability distributions to describe the world, make predictions, and support
decision-making under uncertainty. Underlying this modeling framework is an
elegant body of theory that bridges two mathematical traditions: probability
and graph theory. This framework provides compact yet expressive
representations of joint probability distributions, yielding powerful
generative models for probabilistic reasoning.
  This tutorial provides a concise introduction to the formalisms, methods, and
applications of this modeling framework. After a review of basic probability
and graph theory, we explore three dominant themes: (1) the representation of
multivariate distributions in the intuitive visual language of graphs, (2)
algorithms for learning model parameters and graphical structures from data,
and (3) algorithms for inference, both exact and approximate.

Abstract: The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, is crucial for
effective containment and treatment, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. This study presents an AI-driven diagnostic tool developed for
deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, leveraging the pre-trained
MobileNetV2 architecture for binary classification. The model was trained on
the open-source Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset, achieving a 93.07% F1-Score,
which reflects a well-balanced performance in precision and recall. To optimize
the model, the TensorRT framework was used to accelerate inference for FP32 and
to perform post-training quantization for FP16 and INT8 formats. TensorRT's
mixed-precision capabilities enabled these optimizations, which reduced the
model size, increased inference speed, and lowered power consumption by
approximately a factor of two, all while maintaining the original accuracy.
Power consumption analysis confirmed that the optimized models used
significantly less energy during inference, reinforcing their suitability for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. The system was deployed with a
Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) hotspot and a web-based interface, enabling users to
upload and analyze images directly through connected devices such as mobile
phones. This setup ensures simple access and seamless connectivity, making the
tool practical for real-world applications. These advancements position the
diagnostic tool as an efficient, scalable, and energy-conscious solution to
address diagnosis challenges in underserved regions, paving the way for broader
adoption in low-resource healthcare settings.

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and preventable types of cancer, yet
its early detection remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited
settings where access to specialized healthcare is scarce. This study proposes
an AI-driven diagnostic tool optimized for embedded systems to address this
gap. Using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture, the model was
adapted for binary classification of skin lesions into "Skin Cancer" and
"Other." The TensorRT framework was employed to compress and optimize the model
for deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, balancing performance with
energy efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted across multiple
benchmarks, including model size, inference speed, throughput, and power
consumption. The optimized models maintained their performance, achieving an
F1-Score of 87.18% with a precision of 93.18% and recall of 81.91%.
Post-compression results showed reductions in model size of up to 0.41, along
with improvements in inference speed and throughput, and a decrease in energy
consumption of up to 0.93 in INT8 precision. These findings validate the
feasibility of deploying high-performing, energy-efficient diagnostic tools on
resource-constrained edge devices. Beyond skin cancer detection, the
methodologies applied in this research have broader applications in other
medical diagnostics and domains requiring accessible, efficient AI solutions.
This study underscores the potential of optimized AI systems to revolutionize
healthcare diagnostics, thereby bridging the divide between advanced technology

TL;DR: 本文讨论了一种名为ARIA的框架，可以让大型语言模型(LLM)在规则频繁变化的环境中持续学习并适应新知识，尤其是在测试时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM方法如离线微调和标准提示无法适应操作过程中不断变化的知识，因此需要一种能动态学习和适应的机制。

Method: 引入ARIA框架，它通过结构化自我对话识别知识空白，与人类专家互动，通过更新时间戳的内部知识库解决知识冲突或过时问题。

Result: ARIA在TikTok Pay的尽职调查任务中以及公开的动态知识任务中表现出显著的适应性和准确性提升。

Conclusion: ARIA在快速变化的环境中具备高实用性和有效性，目前已成功部署于TikTok Pay，服务超过1.5亿活跃用户。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules
and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance
and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and
standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to
new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose
the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework
designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test
time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue,
proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or
corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal,
timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and
resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and
clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence
name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic
knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability
and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and
existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over
150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness
for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

Conclusion: SADA方法有效解决了扩散模型采样速度和质量之间的权衡问题，具备广泛的适配能力和显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings
between function spaces. However, there are two main bottlenecks in training
neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We
provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/PICore.

Abstract: Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the
predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box"
nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders
the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and
prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI)
methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the
causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide
explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable
countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based
counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations
for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against
several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3
modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also
presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation
algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our
proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the
tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by
reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how
counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing
them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at
instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global
counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack
queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense
mechanisms.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate
change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been
made by the \textbf{end-to-end methods}, thanks to deep learning techniques,
but they face limitations of \textit{representation inconsistency} in
multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency
between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating
different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \textbf{two-stage
training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue,
but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the
results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an
implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders
for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen
while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second
stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures
inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a
self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the
performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments
show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces
the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by
28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively. The source code is available at

Abstract: Effective content moderation is essential for video platforms to safeguard
user experience and uphold community standards. While traditional video
classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they
struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and
contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a
promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal
reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder
their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes
full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for
discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,
we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a
multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable
industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that
integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over
traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online
evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume
by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5%
of direct full-scale deployment.

Abstract: Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Xiaochang Li,Huajie Shao,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的分割学习框架P3SL，在资源受限的异构边缘设备环境中实现个性化隐私保护和模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的分割学习在异构环境中未能很好地兼顾个性化隐私需求和环境变化下的本地模型定制。

Method: 设计了一个个性化的顺序分割学习流程，并通过双层优化技术允许客户端独立选择最佳分割点，无需向服务器共享敏感信息。

Result: 在7个设备（包括Jetson Nano、Raspberry Pi和笔记本电脑）的测试平台上，使用不同模型和数据集评估后，取得了在能耗和隐私泄露风险之间的均衡，并维持了高模型精度。

Conclusion: P3SL解决了异构边缘设备环境中的隐私保护和计算资源分配问题，为分割学习在多元环境下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning
technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in
model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side
sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it
encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices
vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental
conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored
heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying
resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and
local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split
Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device
systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a
personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to
achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models
tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and
privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers
clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without
sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,
environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach
balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high
model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7
devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop,
using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦于通过减少联邦学习中的数据量来降低其环境影响，提出了一种数据中心方法并引入交互式推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI与ML的发展伴随高能耗和碳排放问题，亟需解决AI对环境的不利影响。联邦学习在一定程度上减少了数据传输，但其异构性和数据量也带来了环保挑战。

Method: 分析联邦数据集特性，选择最佳的数据子集和低影响节点；提出交互式推荐系统，通过数据减少优化联邦学习配置。

Result: 在时间序列分类中验证了方法的有效性，显著降低了联邦学习任务的环境影响。

Conclusion: 数据中心联邦学习方法在优化性能的同时减少碳排放，对推动绿色AI具有重大意义。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of
energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the
need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the
key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size
of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data
continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple
locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated
Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw
data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to
the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),
computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a
data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on
reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.
Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated
datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,
and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We
develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric
factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon
emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive
recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,
minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to
time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the
environmental impact of FL tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效且灵活的全上下文自注意力机制DistrAttention，能够显著提升大型Transformer模型的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自注意力机制因其相对于序列长度的二次复杂度，限制了Transformer的可扩展性，而现有的优化方法要么丢失全局信息，要么缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过利用基于嵌入维度的数据分组，结合局部敏感哈希的轻量级采样和融合方法，以及分块分组框架优化误差，并与FlashAttention-2集成。

Result: DistrAttention在计算自注意力时比FlashAttention-2快37%，在ViT推理中最为快速且准确，在Llama3-1B中推理时间最低，且仅损失1%的精度。

Conclusion: DistrAttention是一种在保持全上下文信息的情况下改进了计算效率的创新型自注意力机制，在现代GPU上表现优异，有助于突破Transformer的扩展瓶颈。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the
state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing,
computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component,
self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence
length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches
on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack
of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and
flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention
achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually
referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and
fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A
block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors
introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block
sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining
high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive
experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than
FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,
DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate
self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the
lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.

TL;DR: 本文引入了一种名为深度归一化Transformer（DNT）的新架构，可在使用简单优化器mSGDW时保持与使用AdamW相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer训练对优化器有较高需求，现有方法中使用AdamW是主流，但这对轻量化和易用性产生了限制。本文尝试通过改进模型设计，使其能适配更基础的优化器如mSGDW。

Method: 通过在Transformer合适的位置插入归一化技术调整各层Jacobian矩阵，平衡权重、激活值及其交互的影响，优化梯度分布集中性。

Result: 与传统模型（如ViT和GPT）相比，DNT表现更优，并证明了DNT可使用mSGDW成功训练。

Conclusion: 利用DNT架构，可在基础优化器mSGDW下实现性能提升，并具备较好的理论和实证支持，降低了训练需求。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了自动编码器（AE）的生成能力，连接变分自动编码器（VAE）与向量量化变分自动编码器（VQ-VAE）。通过新框架，展示AE潜在空间的生成潜力，并提出改进VAE的训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统VAE训练中潜在空间的未定义区域和依赖KL散度问题，提出通过聚类中心提高数据紧凑性，改进方法，以拓展生成潜力。

Method: 模型重新定义了训练方式，引入聚类中心绕开KL散度与再参数化，强化潜在空间的一致性。实验选择MNIST、CelebA及FashionMNIST数据集，解析其内插与扰动生成性能。

Result: 实验展示在潜在空间实现平滑过渡，但仍存在模糊问题。多向量扩展后，模型可自然转化为接近VQ-VAE。然而，若编码输出多向量，则模型退化为离散AE，难以捕获语义。

Conclusion: 研究突出了潜在空间紧凑性和分散性对生成能力的重要性，探索VAE与VQ-VAE内在联系，为其设计与局限提供新视角。

Abstract: This paper explores the generative capabilities of Autoencoders (AEs) and
establishes connections between Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Vector
Quantized-Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) through a reformulated training
framework. We demonstrate that AEs exhibit generative potential via latent
space interpolation and perturbation, albeit limited by undefined regions in
the encoding space. To address this, we propose a new VAE-like training method
that introduces clustering centers to enhance data compactness and ensure
well-defined latent spaces without relying on traditional KL divergence or
reparameterization techniques. Experimental results on MNIST, CelebA, and
FashionMNIST datasets show smooth interpolative transitions, though blurriness
persists. Extending this approach to multiple learnable vectors, we observe a
natural progression toward a VQ-VAE-like model in continuous space. However,
when the encoder outputs multiple vectors, the model degenerates into a
discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which combines image fragments without learning
semantic representations. Our findings highlight the critical role of encoding
space compactness and dispersion in generative modeling and provide insights
into the intrinsic connections between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, offering a new
perspective on their design and limitations.

Abstract: Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations
(DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a
critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or
specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event
Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES
data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation
events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating
interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries
for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.
This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational
issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck
identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities,
outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves
near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex
investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to
uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling
and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights,
reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency
evaluation and diagnosis.

Conclusion: 所提方法能够在去中心化架构下实现有效的联邦学习，为生成式分类器构建全局模型提供了新方法。

Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of increasing relevance in real world
applications, aimed at building a global model across a network of
heterogeneous users without requiring the sharing of private data. We focus on
model learning over decentralized architectures, where users collaborate
directly to update the global model without relying on a central server. In
this context, the current paper proposes a novel approach to collaboratively
learn probabilistic generative classifiers with a parametric form. The
framework is composed by a communication network over a set of local nodes,
each of one having its own local data, and a local updating rule. The proposal
involves sharing local statistics with neighboring nodes, where each node
aggregates the neighbors' information and iteratively learns its own local
classifier, which progressively converges to a global model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally
competitive model across a wide range of network topologies, network sizes,
local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Rubrics as Rewards (RaR)的框架，通过结构化的清单式规则作为可解释奖励信号，用于强化学习任务中的模型训练。相比传统方法，RaR方法在多项基准任务上表现更优或至少持平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于偏好的方法难以定义清晰且透明的奖励信号，尤其是在缺乏明确真实值的真实世界任务中，本文旨在通过使用结构化规则解决这一问题。

Method: 提出RaR框架，将清单式评分规则作为奖励信号，与强化学习中的GRPO算法结合应用以优化语言模型的表现。

Result: 实验表明，相较于基于Likert评分方法，RaR在HealthBench-1k基准上的表现提升达28%，并与使用专家书面引用生成的奖励信号方法相媲美甚至超越。

Conclusion: RaR方法通过引入透明的、结构化的奖励信号，改善了小规模判别模型与人类偏好的对齐能力，并具有跨模型规模的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world
tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria.
However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it
difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models.
While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on
opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious
correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework
that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals
for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$
relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based
approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals
derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured
reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better
align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model
scales.

Result: 在数学推理基准上，R-Stitch将推理时延减少了85%，同时几乎没有准确率下降。

Conclusion: R-Stitch在保持推理质量的同时显著提升了推理效率，为链式推理的加速提供了实用可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

Method: 提出C2L模型，结合工具变量的强大能力，通过两阶段框架实现有效工具变量识别与策略优化：第一阶段通过伪变量定义的测试准则识别有效工具变量，第二阶段利用该工具变量通过仿真器或离线学习进行策略学习。

Result: 实验验证了有效工具变量的识别能力和策略学习的效果。

Conclusion: C2L模型有效解决了未观测混杂因素的问题并提升了策略学习准确性。

Abstract: Imitation learning from demonstrations usually suffers from the confounding
effects of unmeasured variables (i.e., unmeasured confounders) on the states
and actions. If ignoring them, a biased estimation of the policy would be
entailed. To break up this confounding gap, in this paper, we take the best of
the strong power of instrumental variables (IV) and propose a Confounded Causal
Imitation Learning (C2L) model. This model accommodates confounders that
influence actions across multiple timesteps, rather than being restricted to
immediate temporal dependencies. We develop a two-stage imitation learning
framework for valid IV identification and policy optimization. In particular,
in the first stage, we construct a testing criterion based on the defined
pseudo-variable, with which we achieve identifying a valid IV for the C2L
models. Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability
conditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we
propose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator,
while the other is offline. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of
identifying the valid IV as well as learning the policy.

sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as
comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow.
Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language

Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have
driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at
much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical
methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle
with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and
geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods
have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate
nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely
limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs
involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain
decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a
single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a
surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle
large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical
result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of
domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method
by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous
microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural
operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers
resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns
unseen during training.

Result: DeCo-SGD在高延迟和低带宽网络中分别实现了比标准D-SGD和静态策略高5.07倍和1.37倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: DeCo-SGD通过动态调整压缩和延迟参数，填补了理论空白并提高了训练任务性能，对高延迟低带宽网络下的分布式机器学习具有重要意义。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning in high end-to-end latency and low, varying
bandwidth network environments undergoes severe throughput degradation. Due to
its low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the
mainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from
significant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing
approaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to
alleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both
challenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a
complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed
synchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance
under varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to
dynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on
static heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which
prevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical
gap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization
problem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable
noise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies
the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a
critical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect
training. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware
time minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the
compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and
training task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and
static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,
respectively.

Abstract: An ordinal classification (OC) problem corresponds to a special type of
classification characterised by the presence of a natural order relationship
among the classes. This type of problem can be found in a number of real-world
applications, motivating the design and development of many ordinal
methodologies over the last years. However, it is important to highlight that
the development of the OC field suffers from one main disadvantage: the lack of
a comprehensive set of datasets on which novel approaches to the literature
have to be benchmarked. In order to approach this objective, this manuscript
from the University of C\'ordoba (UCO), which have previous experience on the
OC field, provides the literature with a publicly available repository of
tabular data for a robust validation of novel OC approaches, namely TOC-UCO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型的多步检索系统在生成中间查询时常会出现事实不一致的问题，并且搜索路径效率不高，影响实际应用。

Method: 提出了 DynaSearcher 系统，将知识图谱作为外部知识，并采用多奖励强化学习框架来优化训练目标，包括检索准确度、效率及响应质量等。

Result: 实验表明 DynaSearcher 在六个多跳问题回答数据集上达到最先进的解答准确率，且仅使用小规模模型和有限计算资源。

Conclusion: DynaSearcher 显示了在多种检索环境和更大规模模型上的强大泛化能力和适用性，表明其具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks.
However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical
applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate
queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning
deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose
DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs
and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system
leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search
process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual
consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for
fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy,
efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of
high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while
discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or
redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets,
matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited
computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and
larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ViRN的新框架，通过变分推断和分布三边测定应对长尾数据的持续学习问题，实现了在6个长尾分类任务上的平均准确率提升10.24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在应对长尾数据分布的持续学习情况下，当前方法难以同时保持模型的稳定性和适应性，尤其在样本不足的情况下表现不佳，需要新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了ViRN框架：利用变分自编码器（Variational Autoencoder）建模类条件分布；通过Wasserstein距离的邻域检索和几何融合重建尾类分布，从而实现高效的样本对齐。

Result: 在6个长尾分类基准任务中（包括稀有声学事件和图像任务的分类等），ViRN在平均准确率上比最先进方法提高了10.24%。

Conclusion: ViRN框架在应对长尾分布和持续学习的问题中具有显著的优势，能更好地平衡模型的稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with long-tailed data distributions remains a
critical challenge for real-world AI systems, where models must sequentially
adapt to new classes while retaining knowledge of old ones, despite severe
class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to balance stability and plasticity,
often collapsing under extreme sample scarcity. To address this, we propose
ViRN, a novel CL framework that integrates variational inference (VI) with
distributional trilateration for robust long-tailed learning. First, we model
class-conditional distributions via a Variational Autoencoder to mitigate bias
toward head classes. Second, we reconstruct tail-class distributions via
Wasserstein distance-based neighborhood retrieval and geometric fusion,
enabling sample-efficient alignment of tail-class representations. Evaluated on
six long-tailed classification benchmarks, including speech (e.g., rare
acoustic events, accents) and image tasks, ViRN achieves a 10.24% average
accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VB-CGCD的新框架，以解决在连续泛化类别发现中，从未标注的数据流中增量学习新类别时遗忘旧类别的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理未标注数据时，尤其是已知和新类别混合时，容易发生灾难性遗忘。为了解决这一问题，本文通过贝叶斯方法分析遗忘动态，发现旧类和新类之间协方差失配是性能下降的主要原因。

Method: 提出了VB-CGCD框架，该框架结合变分推断和协方差感知的最近类别平均分类，通过自适应调整类别分布和抑制伪标签噪声来削弱遗忘效果。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，VB-CGCD的最终总准确率比现有方法高出15.21%；在更具挑战性的基准测试（仅10%标注数据且在线阶段延长）中取得67.86%的准确率，显著超越现有最高成果（38.55%）。

Conclusion: VB-CGCD通过整合变分推断和协方差感知分类，有效应对了新类与旧类学习之间的遗忘挑战，展示了跨多种场景的强大适用性。

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge:
incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving
knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We
address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens,
revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives
performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes
C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with
covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns
class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic
variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21%
with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also
introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended
online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher
than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across
diverse scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/daihao42/VB-CGCD

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了各种模型量化方法，通过实验研究其效果，重点分析了预量化转换和量化误差缓解的影响，并探索了最新的MXFP4数据格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，后期训练量化（PTQ）是削减内存占用和计算开销的重要方法，但目前存在实验不统一和方法理论联系缺乏分析的问题。

Method: 对现有量化方法做了全面的回顾，将其分为预量化转换和量化误差缓解两个部分进行深入评估，并分析MXFP4数据格式和其表现。

Result: 实验表明，优化的旋转和缩放在预量化转换中表现最佳；结合低秩补偿和GPTQ方法有时能优于单独使用GPTQ；MXFP4量化的性能显示出与INT4不同的最佳策略，启发了进一步研究。

Conclusion: 优化不同量化方法的各组成部分以及探索新数据格式对提升量化效果至关重要，同时显示出量化方法仍有需深入研究的领域。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can
significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model
quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have
reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same
ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In
addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is
crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an
extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive
evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge,
this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet
underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple
the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization
transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a
preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of
outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for
quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the
errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We
evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization
methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and
its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation
and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and
combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ
alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential
of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization
transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring
further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前分支与界限(BaB)方法在处理神经网络验证时缺乏对子问题优先级的智能排序，导致验证效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种基于子问题优先级排序的验证框架Oliva, 包括两个变种: $Oliva^{GR}$，优先处理可能存在反例的子问题；$Oliva^{SA}$，逐渐从探索转向开发以定位最优子问题。

Result: 在690个验证问题上实验表明，相较于传统方法，Oliva框架显著加速了验证过程，在MNIST和CIFAR10数据集上分别实现了25倍和80倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 通过智能排序子问题的优先级，Oliva框架在不牺牲性能的前提下大幅提高了神经网络验证的效率。

Abstract: The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has
necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the
quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is
a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to
sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the
sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these
sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from
an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this
gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,
concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.
Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that
explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more
likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of
the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it
only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead
to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including
$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that
are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy
inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to
exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally
evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5
models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up
to 80X in CIFAR10.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为C3RL的新型框架，通过结合通道混合（CM）和通道独立（CI）策略，以提高多元时间序列预测的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列预测因其实用性受到关注，但现有方法在处理变量依赖和变量特定时间模式方面存在局限性，因此需要新的方法克服这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为C3RL的框架，该框架基于对比学习，结合CM和CI策略，采用共轭网络架构，并通过自适应权衡对比损失与预测损失以优化表现。

Result: 在七个模型中的实验表明，C3RL将基于CI策略的模型性能提升到81.4%，而基于CM策略的模型提升到76.3%，表现出较强的泛化性和效果。

Conclusion: C3RL在平衡变量依赖与变量特定模式的同时提供了更好的预测能力，展示了强大的实用性与潜力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to
its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either
channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can
capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific
temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit
cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion
offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we
propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models
both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer
vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and
builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone,
while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and
prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and
forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL
boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy
and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong
generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is
accepted.

Abstract: Human decision-making in high-stakes domains often relies on expertise and
heuristics, but is vulnerable to hard-to-detect cognitive biases that threaten
fairness and long-term outcomes. This work presents a novel approach to
enhancing complex decision-making workflows through the integration of
hierarchical learning alongside various enhancements. Focusing on university
admissions as a representative high-stakes domain, we propose BGM-HAN, an
enhanced Byte-Pair Encoded, Gated Multi-head Hierarchical Attention Network,
designed to effectively model semi-structured applicant data. BGM-HAN captures
multi-level representations that are crucial for nuanced assessment, improving
both interpretability and predictive performance. Experimental results on real
admissions data demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms
both state-of-the-art baselines from traditional machine learning to large
language models, offering a promising framework for augmenting decision-making
in domains where structure, context, and fairness matter. Source code is

Motivation: 解决现有生成模型假设欧几里得几何及依赖密度估计但不符合底层流形最优轨迹的问题。

Method: 设计HOTA方法，使用Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman方法及Kantorovich势函数解决动态OT问题，实现高效可扩展的轨迹优化。

Result: 在标准基准和非光滑成本自定义数据集上，HOTA在可行性和最优性方面均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: HOTA实现了无需显式密度建模的轨迹优化，有效克服现有方法的局限，在理论和实践上都有较大提升。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the
probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial
geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions,
yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in
the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection
(HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical
OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and
scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for
explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are
non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks,
as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of
feasibility and optimality.

Conclusion: 结合低秩结构和图信息的创新方法在理论和实践中均显示出了其优越性。在连续决策中能显著提升效果。

Abstract: The matrix contextual bandit (CB), as an extension of the well-known
multi-armed bandit, is a powerful framework that has been widely applied in
sequential decision-making scenarios involving low-rank structure. In many
real-world scenarios, such as online advertising and recommender systems,
additional graph information often exists beyond the low-rank structure, that
is, the similar relationships among users/items can be naturally captured
through the connectivity among nodes in the corresponding graphs. However,
existing matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby
making them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill
in this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework
that builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new
framework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph
information in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a
joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the
implementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB
algorithm. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that our procedure
outperforms several popular alternatives in terms of cumulative regret bound,
owing to the effective utilization of graph information. A series of synthetic
and real-world data experiments are conducted to further illustrate the merits
of our procedure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的广义优势估计 (GAE) 主要解决强化学习中的计算复杂度问题，但无法处理分布强化学习中的价值分布问题，引发了对更鲁棒估计方法的需求。

Method: 采用最优传输理论，引入Wasserstein-like方向度量，并结合指数加权估计方法，提出分布广义优势估计 (DGAE)。

Result: 将DGAE集成到三种不同的策略梯度方法中，并在多个OpenAI Gym环境中进行测试，结果显示其性能优于传统GAE基线方法。

Conclusion: DGAE能够在控制偏差的情况下提供低方差的优势估计，与策略梯度算法相结合表现优异，尤其适用于分布强化学习问题。

Abstract: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) has been used to mitigate the
computational complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) by employing an
exponentially weighted estimation of the advantage function to reduce the
variance in policy gradient estimates. Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not
designed to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can
capture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to
system noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes
the optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional
metric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies
between probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation,
we leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional
GAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a
low-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for
policy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy
updates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods.
Algorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared
with the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的视角和工具，能够统一随机优化算法的设计，并增强其在联邦学习中的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified approach for designing stochastic optimization
algorithms that robustly scale to the federated learning setting. Our work
studies a class of Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, which possesses a
linearly parameterized family of majorizing surrogate functions. This framework
encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth
objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as
variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying
algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM),
which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then
extend \SSMM\ to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common
bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and
communication constraints; this yields \QSMM. The originality of \QSMM\ is to
learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the
\textit{surrogate majorizing function}, contrary to classical algorithms which
learn and aggregate the \textit{original parameter}. Finally, to showcase the
flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to
design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated
setting.

Conclusion: QFL利用费舍尔信息的优势，在分布式量子模型训练中应用，为量子联邦学习提供了新的可能性和有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different
sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model
without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication
between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several
challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged
processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent
years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits
has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for
fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of
quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance
model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that
Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state
carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric
and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the
aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on
local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.
This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence
the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the
aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of
QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the
benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental
results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum
federated averaging method.

However, they are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. In this
paper, we introduce XStacking, an effective and inherently explainable

transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations. This enables
stacked models to retain their predictive accuracy while becoming inherently
explainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on 29 datasets,
achieving improvements in both the predictive effectiveness of the learning
space and the interpretability of the resulting models. XStacking offers a
practical and scalable solution for responsible ML.

Abstract: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on
manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the
performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise
for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from
supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.
However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different
meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box
functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical
comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned
algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to
meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the
interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.
Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL
algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as
performant as possible.

Abstract: Dual discriminator generative adversarial networks (D2 GANs) were introduced
to mitigate the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks. In
D2 GANs, two discriminators are employed alongside a generator: one
discriminator rewards high scores for samples from the true data distribution,
while the other favors samples from the generator. In this work, we first
introduce dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs), which combines
the strengths of dual discriminators with the flexibility of a tunable loss
function, $\alpha$-loss. We further generalize this approach to arbitrary
functions defined on positive reals, leading to a broader class of models we
refer to as generalized dual discriminator generative adversarial networks. For
each of these proposed models, we provide theoretical analysis and show that
the associated min-max optimization reduces to the minimization of a linear
combination of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence. This generalizes
the known simplification for D2-GANs, where the objective reduces to a linear
combination of the KL-divergence and the reverse KL-divergence. Finally, we
perform experiments on 2D synthetic data and use multiple performance metrics
to capture various advantages of our GANs.

Conclusion: OGCIL有效缓解了遗忘问题，对未知类别检测表现出色，为开放集图类增量学习提供了一种新颖框架。

Abstract: Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs)
to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class
knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods
primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed
to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge
during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a
more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two
intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs
the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which
destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,
a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding
generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust
detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional
variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old
classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle
unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node
embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further
proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class
prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all
unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly
models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a
robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN
methods.

Conclusion: JAL框架通过结合非对称损失和先进优化方法，为处理标签噪声问题提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HydraOpt，一个新的模型融合技术，可以减少存储需求并保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限资源场景中，存储多个适配器导致的内存需求较高问题。

Method: 利用低秩适配器矩阵的内在相似性进行模型融合，提供存储和性能权衡选择。

Result: 实验表明，HydraOpt在减少存储规模和性能之间达到了优势平衡，存储减少48%，性能仅下降0.2-1.8%。

Conclusion: HydraOpt能在维持性能的同时优化存储效率，比现有的融合技术表现更优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based
adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a
separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements,
posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile
devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they
typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we
introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the
inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike
existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and
performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and
performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage
size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving
competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing
merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse
storage efficiency.

Conclusion: 模型的结构性压缩性与对抗鲁棒性之间存在基本冲突，为设计既高效又安全的模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

Abstract: Over the past decade, advances in generative modeling, such as generative
adversarial networks, masked autoencoders, and diffusion models, have
significantly transformed biological research and discovery, enabling
breakthroughs in molecule design, protein generation, drug discovery, and
beyond. At the same time, biological applications have served as valuable
testbeds for evaluating the capabilities of generative models. Recently, flow
matching has emerged as a powerful and efficient alternative to diffusion-based
generative modeling, with growing interest in its application to problems in
biology and life sciences. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of recent developments in flow matching and its applications in biological
domains. We begin by systematically reviewing the foundations and variants of
flow matching, and then categorize its applications into three major areas:
biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and
protein generation. For each, we provide an in-depth review of recent progress.
We also summarize commonly used datasets and software tools, and conclude with
a discussion of potential future directions. The corresponding curated

Result: 大学习率在多种数据集、模型和优化器上表现出色，同时支持鲁棒性与资源效率。

Conclusion: 大学习率不仅有助于标准分类任务，还能够解决训练数据集中的隐藏/罕见虚假相关性问题。

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to
create realistic models for brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness
in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological
realism. Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane
voltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
with Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time
depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network
expressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by
long-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting
non-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE
Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term
dependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order
dynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns
beyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of
fspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters
by solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using
adjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph
datasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs,
achieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training
memory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a
novel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely
applicable to various real-world tasks.
