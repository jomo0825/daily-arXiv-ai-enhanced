### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR是一种旨在实时驾驶疲劳检测的轻量高效目标检测模型，融合了CNN和Transformer特性，同时具备空间定位的改进能力，并在DSM数据集上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高交通事故安全性，克服现有生理及视觉检测方法的局限性，设计一种能非侵入式、高效、适用于实际环境的驾驶疲劳检测方法。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含两个关键模块：Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM)用于增强特征表达能力；Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM)优化空间定位特别是侧面人脸和小目标。

Result: YOLO11-CR性能优异，在DSM数据集上达成87.17%精度、83.86%召回率、88.09%的mAP@50及55.93%的mAP@50-95，明显超越基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车内疲劳监测提供了实际且高效的解决方案，并具备进一步结合时间建模、多模态数据和嵌入式优化能力的潜力。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

*Cheng Xia,Manxi Lin,Jiexiang Tan,Xiaoxiong Du,Yang Qiu,Junjun Zheng,Xiangheng Kong,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对现实场景中AI生成图像(AIGI)检测的挑战，并提出了一个新基准Mirage和改进检测模型Mirage-R1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的AIGI检测方法在实验室环境中有效，但在现实场景中难以应对复杂性和多样性。

Method: 提出Mirage基准，结合互联网验证数据和多源生成的合成数据；设计了基于视觉-语言模型的Mirage-R1，包含启发式到分析性推理和反思机制，并通过两阶段训练和推理阶段自适应思考策略优化性能。

Result: Mirage-R1在新基准和公开基准中检测性能分别提升5%和10%，显著超过最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mirage和Mirage-R1为现实场景中AIGI检测提供高效解决方案，其代码和基准将公开，助力信息安全与信任维护。

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时间步压缩攻击（TCA）的新框架，减少脉冲神经网络（SNNs）中对抗攻击的延迟，同时保持高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的对抗攻击方法存在延迟问题，扣留了SNNs在实时应用中的潜力。本工作希望通过利用SNNs的特性解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了时间步反向传播（TLBP）和对抗膜电位复用（A-MPR）两个关键组件，利用SNN行为特点减少攻击尽可能的延迟。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集上进行实验，表明TCA在白箱与黑箱设置下分别能将攻击延迟减少56.6%和57.1%，同时保持类似的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA利用SNN特性在减少攻击延迟上展现出显著优势，为SNNs的实时对抗应用提供了可能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

### [4] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1 是一个整合了推理和工具的视觉-语言模型，用于改进 OCR 任务中的性能和减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升现有大规模视觉-语言模型在 OCR 任务中的性能，同时减少幻觉现象，结合专家模型以解决通用模型对特定任务效果不足的问题。

Method: 提出 DianJin-OCR-R1 框架，该框架通过结合模型自身识别能力与专家模型结果，并在图像和推理过程间反复迭代，提供最终的识别内容。

Result: 在 ReST 和 OmniDocBench 数据集上的实验结果表明，DianJin-OCR-R1 明显优于非推理的对比模型和专家 OCR 模型。

Conclusion: 通过引入推理增强和专家模型的结合，DianJin-OCR-R1 改善了 OCR 任务的性能，并验证了模型方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，用以解决因复杂结构引起的高错误率问题，模型分类准确率达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语由于其复杂的几何和形态结构，导致字符分类困难，特别是在基于分割的识别上易出现高错误率，因此研究希望改善字符分类准确性。

Method: 提出一种基于组件分类的乌尔都语光学字符识别方法，利用卷积神经网络自动学习特征，通过生成三字符排列组合数据集，并应用连通组件技术清除冗余图像，仅保留连接字形，分层神经网络分两级处理字符排列和组件分类。

Result: 模型在组件分类上取得了99%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于卷积神经网络的模型有效解决了乌尔都语光学字符识别中的主要挑战，在字符组件分类上展现了高效和准确性。

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [6] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CLoE的课程学习框架，用于优化溃疡性结肠炎的Mayo内镜评分（MES）的分类，解决了标注噪声和序数性质的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MES分类存在标注噪声和序数结构难题，需开发更鲁棒的方法提高诊断精度。

Method: 采用基于图像质量的课程学习框架，并结合ResizeMix数据增强，来在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上提升模型性能。

Result: 在CNN和Transformer模型上，CLoE方法在MES分类任务中显著优于现有基线，ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到了82.5%分类准确率和0.894的加权κ值。

Conclusion: CLoE验证了在标注不确定性条件下基于样本难度的训练策略对序数分类任务的改进效果，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [7] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GaitCrafter的扩散框架，用于生成高质量、可控且保护隐私的步态序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别因缺乏大规模标注数据集和多样化样本采集困难限制了其发展，亟需一种能解决数据不足和隐私问题的新方法。

Method: 提出GaitCrafter框架，基于步态轮廓数据训练视频扩散模型，生成时间一致且身份保留的步态序列，同时支持对服装、携带物品、视角等变量的控制。

Result: 通过引入GaitCrafter生成的样本提升步态识别性能，尤其在挑战性条件下表现突出，并通过插值身份嵌入生成新身份，从而实现隐私保护。

Conclusion: GaitCrafter在高质量、可控和隐私保护的步态数据生成方面取得了重要进展，为步态识别模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [8] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Prune2Drive，一种针对于多视角视觉语言模型的视觉token修剪方法，可显著减少计算开销，同时维持或提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶应用中的多视角视觉语言模型由于需要处理高分辨率、多视角图像，计算开销大，推理延迟严重。

Method: Prune2Drive包括：(i)基于远点采样的多样性感知token选择机制，以优先考虑跨视角的语义与空间覆盖；(ii)自适应视角修剪控制器，学习针对每个摄像头视角的最优修剪比例。

Result: 在两个大规模驾驶数据集DriveLM与DriveLMM-o1上进行验证，修剪90%视觉token后仍能实现6.40倍速度提升，13.4%的FLOPs使用率，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或Attention图信息，兼容现代高效Attention，实现大幅节省计算资源且性能保持稳定。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH 是一种全微分元攻击框架，通过组合多种 Lp-约束攻击方法生成感知对齐的对抗样本，显著优于当前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 Lp-约束攻击方法生成的对抗样本难以与人类感知对齐，且如何利用这些方法来提高感知效果尚不明确。

Method: 提出 DAASH 框架，多阶段整合多个基础攻击方法生成对抗样本，利用元损失函数优化分类错误与感知失真的平衡。

Result: DAASH 在 CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100 和 ImageNet 数据集上取得了显著的攻击成功率提升及更好的视觉质量指标，同时对未知防御具有良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: DAASH 提供了一种实用且强大的标准，用于在不需要手工调整防御的情况下评估模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，通过结构化的提示和知识蒸馏方法，改进交通场景理解和风险推断，并开发出名为VISTA的小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在复杂动态环境中扩展性和泛化能力的不足，提高交通场景理解与风险评估能力。

Method: 构建一个框架，结合两个大规模视觉语言模型（GPT-4o和o3-mini），采用结构化连锁思维（CoT）策略生成高质量伪标注，用于训练一个更小的学生模型VISTA。

Result: VISTA模型在低分辨率交通视频的语义理解和风险感知任务中表现出色，在BLEU-4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr等指标上接近其教师模型。

Conclusion: 通过知识蒸馏和多代理监督，VISTA实现了高效部署于边缘设备，为实时风险监控提供了可能性，同时无需大规模基础设施升级。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR 通过共享部分特定层，减少多图像的存储与计算消耗，同时保留性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示（INRs）在为多图像编码时，由于每张图像都需要独立的神经网络，存在计算和存储方面的低效问题。

Method: MINR通过共享中间层来减少冗余，并为每张图像设计独立的输入输出层和新的投影层，以捕捉独特特性。

Result: MINR在图像重建和超分辨率任务中保存了高达60%的存储参数，同时保持了相近的性能，处理100张图像时PSNR平均值为34 dB。

Conclusion: MINR显著提高了多图像编码的效率，同时证明了其稳健性，适配多种网络结构。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的分布感知Hadamard量化方案（DHQ），不仅适用于权重还适用于激活值的量化，从而显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示（INRs）因未充分利用激活值量化，硬件节省效果有限。因此，需要开发既针对权重又针对激活的量化方法以最大化硬件效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于Hadamard变换的方法，将多样化分布归一化为单一的钟形分布，再使用标准量化器量化。

Result: 实验表明，在多个图像重建任务中，DHQ方法在延迟、能耗和资源利用率方面优于以往方法，分别减少了32.7%、40.1%和高达98.3%。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，DHQ实现了优越的量化效果，并展示了其在硬件实现中的实际价值。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: 新提出的FAMNet模型能够有效提升微表情识别任务的性能，为该领域注入了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR技术对于快门速度与ISO的复杂交互及动态场景的运动模糊处理不够，难以实现高质量HDR。

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE，通过引入结合运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成管道，并利用语义信息与曝光直方图，基于强化学习选择最优ISO和快门速度组合。

Result: 在多组数据集上实验结果表明，该方法达到了最新的HDR成像性能水平。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能根据曝光时间预算自适应选择最佳的曝光策略，在动态场景中优于传统HDR解决方案。

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences

### [28] [2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515)
*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)，一种通过引入2D高斯分布增强图像编码结构建模的新方法，大幅度提升图像重建表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于量化的图像标记器如VQ-GAN主要侧重于纹理和颜色编码，但忽略了几何结构信息。作者希望设计一种方法能够更好地捕捉图像的几何和空间结构。

Method: 针对传统量化方法不足，提出VGQ框架，在视觉码本量化中集成2D高斯分布，将图像编码为包含位置、旋转、比例等结构信息的拉普拉斯分布。通过增加高斯密度，加强重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256数据集上，VGQ取得了显著的重建效果(rFID=0.556，PSNR=24.93)，远超现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ显著增强了结构化信息的捕捉能力，在图像重建任务上性能远超当前主流方法，证明了其在视觉标记中的优越性。代码将会开放。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中训练样本与真实分布之间的差距问题，特别是面向联邦学习和长尾识别的场景。

Method: 利用基础模型提取的特征分布几何形状，通过几何知识指导，提出了一种分布校准框架，并在保护隐私的情况下获取几何信息用于数据生成和类别分布恢复。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试上有效改进了联邦学习和长尾分类的性能，克服了数据异质性和样本不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 通过基础模型的几何迁移能力，证明几何知识指导的分布校准在提升深度学习性能上具有实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在表情识别（FER）任务中的表现，特别是应对低分辨率与高噪声图像的挑战。

Method: 比较Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP与传统深度学习模型在FER-2013数据集上的表现，并引入基于GFPGAN的图像恢复方法以提高任务性能，同时详细分析计算成本。

Result: 传统模型如EfficientNet-B0（86.44%）和ResNet-50（85.72%）表现显著优于VLMs（CLIP为64.07%，Phi-3.5 Vision为51.66%），凸显了VLMs在低质量视觉任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 表情识别任务中，传统模型当前仍优于视觉语言模型；需要进一步改进VLMs以适应嘈杂环境，为未来研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAvatar的新框架，通过改进3D Gaussian Splatting技术，实现了高精度头部重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的方法难以捕捉细致的面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性，尤其在高度可变形区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出一种基于3DGS的EAvatar框架，采用稀疏表达控制机制以及高质量3D先验，提高表情建模精度及纹理细节保真度。

Result: 实验结果表明，本方法在表情可控性和细节保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 此框架可更准确、稳定地重建高质量头部模型，在AR/VR及多媒体内容创作中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进隐式神经表示的方法FLAIR，解决了频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示缺乏频率选择性、空间定位能力和稀疏性，导致其在处理高频细节时表现不佳。

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两大创新：RC-GAUSS（实现时间-频率选择性和空间局部性）和WEGE（利用小波变换指导频率信息编码）。

Result: FLAIR方法在2D图像表示与恢复以及3D重建任务上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过创新设计的激活函数和编码方法，克服了现有隐式神经表示的不足，提升了性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统注视点追踪方法依赖昂贵硬件的问题，提高VR中注视点渲染的易用性和普及性。

Method: 采用Spherical Vision Transformer和LSTM时间编码器，结合多模态融合网络，实现空间场景特征与时间注视动态的融合预测未来的注视点位置及置信度。

Result: GazeProphet在大规模VR数据集上实现了3.83度的中位角误差，比传统显著性模型提升了24%，且在不同场景和空间区域中表现一致。统计分析证实了其在各指标上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过GazeProphet，可以无需专用硬件实现高性能的注视点预测，为各种VR平台和应用提供了更加可及的解决方案。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式人脸视频编码GFVC受到模型参数和计算复杂度的限制，本研究旨在提出低复杂度的解决方案以促进实际应用部署。

Method: 提出了双模式优化框架，包括架构重设计（用高效层代替传统卷积层）和操作优化（两阶段自适应通道剪枝策略）。

Result: 与基线相比实现了90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，同时在感知质量上优于现代视频编码标准VVC。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN因尖峰数据的信息容量有限，其性能通常落后于CNN，且很多改进方法与类脑计算的初衷背离。

Method: 设计了基于生物神经元操作原理的神经元样编码方法，并结合人工光感受器层使尖峰数据包含颜色和亮度信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法增加了尖峰信号的信息含量，提升了SNN的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法符合类脑计算原则，展示了较大的发展潜力，为SNN领域提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DictAS框架，无需在目标数据上重新训练即可检测未见类别中的视觉异常，仅利用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中对未见类别的泛化能力依赖于训练集中真实异常样本的先验知识。

Method: DictAS通过自监督学习而非记忆正常和异常特征模式，引入字典构建、字典查找和查询区分正则化三个模块。

Result: 在七个工业和医疗公共数据集上，DictAS的方法表现优于现有少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS框架实现了对未见类别异常的无重训练检测，展示出较强的跨类别泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: 高计算成本的SMPLify难以实际应用，数据驱动的神经网络显示了提升效率的潜力。

Method: 利用时序采样构建数据对，结合人类中心的归一化和残差学习，设计一个学习框架替代迭代优化。支持序列推断和插件后处理。

Result: 相比SMPLify，运行速度提升近200倍；在未见过的数据上泛化能力强；作为插件工具具有模型无关性。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify是一种高效、简单且泛化性强的3D人体姿态估计方法，与现有工具良好兼容。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效结合特征语义，适用于不同的高性能智能视频分析场景。

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Conclusion: 通过创新性的模块设计和简化，显著提高了模型的分割表现，为RVOS的进一步发展提供新思路。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain

snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: MaMe提出了一种针对SSM视觉模型的高效token合并策略，在保证序列特性同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升SSM在计算机视觉中的计算效率，以实现实际可扩展性。

Method: 提出MaMe策略，利用状态转移参数作为信息测量，并通过策略性token排列保持序列信息。

Result: 在图像分类、视频和音频等领域中，MaMe均表现出优异的效率-性能权衡，并在高激进性token裁剪下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM相关领域在效率与性能之间提供了优良的平衡选择，具有一定实用推广价值。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

TL;DR: 提出FoundationSSC，通过双重解耦设计与新型融合模块提升3D场景语义完成的性能，在多个基准测试中取得了最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需在语义与几何需求间权衡，限制了性能。

Method: 通过源级和通路级双重解耦的设计分离语义和几何特征，并引入Axis-Aware Fusion模块进行特征融合。

Result: 实验表明，在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准上分别实现了+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU的领先表现。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过创新的双重解耦与融合技术，显著提升了语义与几何指标，奠定了新标杆。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: PersonaVlog框架通过实现高效多模态协作和自我修正，展现了在自动化Vlog生成中的有效性和广阔前景。

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）识别输入图像旋转角度的能力，结果表明模型在区分0°、90°、180°和270°图像时表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前多模态大语言模型在视觉推理领域的不足，尤其是在基于旋转线索和空间关系识别图像方向的任务上。

Method: 引入名为RotBench的350张手动筛选图像基准，评估MLLMs模型在识别图像旋转任务中的表现，并尝试通过辅助信息（如字幕、深度图）和不同提示方式提升模型表现。

Result: 发现模型对0°和180°的图像识别能力相对较好，但普遍无法可靠区分90°和270°的旋转；通过同时展示不同方向图像或使用投票机制，可以在一定程度上改善结果，但微调对90°与270°的区分效果提升不大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有多模态大语言模型在旋转识别任务上的空间推理能力显著低于人类感知水平。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 现有模型无法充分泛化至不同种族、语言和年龄，这是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性上的不足。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化管道筛选出高质量的TalkVid数据集，同时构建TalkVid-Bench评估集，以实现模型性能的全面评估。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集为音频驱动人脸合成提供更广泛的多样性与标准化评估，有助于未来领域研究。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

TL;DR: 本文提出基于RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计方法，使用Transformer网络和几何特征引导算法，并通过实验验证其效率和性能优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RGB-D的方法在缺少深度信息的场景中表现有限，因此需要研究仅依赖RGB图像的物体姿态估计方法。

Method: 设计了一种基于Transformer的神经网络预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，利用几何特征引导算法增强网络对几何信息的表示能力，并通过RANSAC-PnP算法计算物体姿态。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法效率高且精度优于以往基于RGB的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖深度数据，为基于RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计提供了新视角，具有良好的前景。

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现扩散模型生成样本质量对CFG权重选择极为敏感，原因是存在“训练-推理”的差距，该差距降低了条件生成性能。

Method: 提出DiffIER，一种优化框架，通过在推理阶段每一步进行迭代错误最小化来减小“训练-推理”的差距，从而提升生成效果。

Result: DiffIER在条件生成任务中效果优于基准方法，并且在文本到图像生成，图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: DiffIER通过优化推理过程的积累误差，提高了扩散模型的生成质量，其方法适用于多种任务，具有较高的通用性和研究潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿研究主要集中在服装，而OmniTry旨在扩展到所有可穿戴物品，以实现更广泛的实际应用。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段的训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模非配对图像训练模型进行掩膜自由的定位；第二阶段使用少量配对样本微调模型以增强物品外观一致性。

Result: 在包含12类可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和身份保留上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniTry为虚拟试穿任务提供了统一和高效的解决方案，并有望推动实际应用发展，相关资源将公开发布。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Method: DeH4R模型包含候选节点检测、相邻节点预测、初始图构建和图扩展四个模块，通过架构创新实现动态顶点与边的插入，同时提升推理速度和拓扑精度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet测试集上，DeH4R在APLS和IoU指标上分别比现有SOTA方法RNGDet++多出4.62和10.18分，且运行速度提升约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R实现了高效率、高精度的道路网络提取，超越现有技术水平，代码将公开提供社区使用。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Motivation: 医疗图像分割数据标注耗时且昂贵，需要利用未标注数据和伪标签技术降低成本；先进状态空间模型的成功激发了其在半监督机制中的探索。

Method: 提出了Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba (DCMamba)框架，从数据、网络和特征三个角度增强多样性：包括弱-强混合增强、不同扫描方向的协同模块、以及不确定性加权对比学习机制。

Result: 在Synapse数据集（20%标注数据）上显著提升分割效果，超出最新SSM方法6.69%。

Conclusion: DCMamba有效利用数据和特征的多样性，成为一种高效的半监督医疗图像分割方法。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: 该研究基于元宇宙提出了新的数据集和检索模型，为教育内容组织与技术模型的优化做出了贡献，并推动了农业教育在虚拟环境中的发展。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

Method: 引入IPGA，通过中间投影模块转换全局图像嵌入为精细化的视觉特征，并通过RQA保留无关的视觉内容，实现细粒度对抗操作。

Result: IPGA在标准图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中表现优于现存方法，并成功迁移到多个商业视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: IPGA方法提升了对抗攻击的精确性和迁移性，为视觉语言模型的安全性提出了新思路。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

### [56] [Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744)
*Yeji Park,Minyoung Lee,Sanghyuk Chun,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs表现优秀，但在多图像任务上性能下降。FOCUS提出一种无需训练的解码策略，通过分步骤遮蔽图像减少信息泄漏，实现更准确的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多图像输入任务中性能下降的问题，尤其是由于跨图像信息泄漏而导致的准确性下降。

Method: 提出FOCUS策略，通过序列化地用随机噪声遮蔽所有图像，仅保留一个干净图像，从而引导模型专注于单一图像；然后通过所有目标图像重复这一过程，并结合对比优化以抑制泄漏。

Result: 在四个多图像基准测试和多个LVLM族上，FOCUS始终提高了性能。

Conclusion: FOCUS是一种无需额外训练和架构修改的通用且实用方案，用于增强多图像推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 目前的6D位姿估计数据集主要关注小型家居物品，而新提出的MR6D数据集针对工业环境下的移动机器人，解决了远距离视觉、自我遮挡等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集普遍针对机器人机械臂操控的小型家居物品，不适用于无机械臂的移动机器人，这些机器人需要处理更大物体且面临更复杂的视觉和遮挡挑战。

Method: 研究人员构建了MR6D数据集，包含92个真实场景，16种独特物体，涵盖静态和动态交互，专注于移动机器人在工业环境中的位姿估计需求。

Result: 实验表明现有6D算法在此数据集上的性能表现较差，尤其是在2D分割方面。

Conclusion: MR6D数据集为开发适用于移动机器人的位姿估计方法提供了重要的基准，并揭示了当前方法在工业场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 现有的3D形状配准研究主要集中于单摄像头场景，而多摄像头的结合可扩展到如医疗影像等新场景。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上验证了方法的精度和有效性。

Conclusion: 首次实现了利用广义摄像机进行3D形状-模板配准的多个解决方案，有助于提高形状重建的准确性。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的框架VisionLaw，通过视觉观察推断物体的固有动力学，其性能和泛化能力均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推断物体动力学时，要么依赖人为定义先验规则，难以适应复杂场景；要么使用神经网络模型，导致解释性差、泛化性弱。

Method: 构建了一个双层优化框架，包括上层的基于LLM驱动的去耦合构成演化策略，用于生成和修订动力学表达；下层的视觉引导构成评价机制，用视觉模拟评估生成规则与实际动力学的一致性。

Result: 实验表明VisionLaw在推断解释性强的固有动力学方面有显著效果，并能很好地泛化到新场景。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有技术面临的难题，兼顾了解释性与泛化性的需求，为物理交互模拟提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 利用多模态学习的方式，结合影像和临床文本，从而提升乳腺癌超声分割的准确性及提供更多可解释性结果。

Method: 采用双分支视觉编码器结合ViT和Swin Transformers，同时引入不确定性感知融合机制；通过BI-RADS语义编码的BioClinicalBERT将临床文本与视觉特征结合，并利用跨模态注意机制实现整合。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过结合影像和结构化临床文本，不仅提升了分割性能，还提供了可信赖的诊断解释，推动了医疗人工智能的可信性标准。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Motivation: 城市树木多样性对气候韧性、生态稳定性和宜居性至关重要，但许多城市缺乏详细的林冠信息，而现有的方法要么成本高昂，要么缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种无监督聚类框架，利用街景图像嵌入和空间种植模式来估算树木的多样性，避免了对标签数据的依赖。

Result: 该方法在8个北美城市上验证后，能够高保真地恢复属级多样性模式，Wasserstein距离接近地面实况数据，同时保留空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 这一可扩展且细粒度的方法为缺乏详细清单的城市提供了生物多样性映射功能，并为支持公平绿化与城市生态系统的适应性管理提供了低成本的持续监测途径。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Conclusion: SA3方法通过高效对齐机制与识别策略，显著提升了跨域检测的表现，为相关研究提供了新的突破点。

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前先进的文本到图像模型在视觉表现上卓越，但无法准确对齐文本提示，导致关键要素缺失或概念混淆。

Method: 方法在去噪过程中显式建模信号部分，提供了细粒度控制，避免过度优化和分布外伪影。此外，该方法无需训练，可无缝集成现有扩散与流匹配架构，并支持额外的条件输入（如边界框）以增强空间对齐。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的框架，在文本到图像生成任务中表现优异，并支持更高层次的空间和内容控制。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone

architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Motivation: 目前增量学习的评估多基于简化的合成基准，无法真实反映出实际应用中的性能表现。

Method: 引入了两个真实感增量式物体检测基准（RICO）：D-RICO关注固定类别集下的领域迁移，EC-RICO结合了新的领域和类别，通过14个多样化数据集构建；并在这些基准上比较了不同增量学习方法的表现。

Result: 所有增量学习的方法在新的适应性和旧知识的保留性上表现不佳；即使只是重放少量先前数据，也能够超越所有方法；但单独训练仍具有最佳性能。

Conclusion: 增量学习在现实复杂场景中有显著局限性，主要由于蒸馏过程中教师模型的不足、单模型无法处理多任务以及可塑性不足等因素；代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 本文通过使用Sentinel-5P数据和ConvLSTM神经网络，预测南亚地区的气溶胶指数，为应对印度恒河平原的重度雾霾提供实时预测参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于南亚恒河平原地区每年重度雾霾事件频发，且空气污染源日益加剧，但缺乏区域性实时预测系统，因此本研究提出开发基于气溶胶指数的预测模型。

Method: 利用2019至2023年的Sentinel-5P卫星数据和一种名为ConvLSTM的卷积长短期记忆神经网络模型，实现气溶胶指数的时空相关性预测。紫外气溶胶指数（340-380nm）被用作主要预测变量。

Result: 研究表明，该模型在五天间隔内可实现气溶胶指数预测，平均平方误差约为0.0018，损失约为0.3995，以及结构相似性指数约为0.74。

Conclusion: 该预测方法验证了其有效性，但仍需结合更多数据并优化模型结构，以进一步提升预测精确度。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 通过有效结合长程依赖与局部上下文信息，SCRNet显著提升了超声医学图像分割的性能，表明其创新设计和综合能力的有效性。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅针对单一类型的光照退化，无法统一处理多样的光照条件，本文旨在构建一个统一框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过混合专家照明估计模块选取适当的S曲线网络，并结合Retinex理论对低光和逆光图像进行增强；设计了包括照明感知交叉注意机制和序列状态全局注意机制的损伤恢复模块；并构建了一个混合光照数据库MixBL用于单次训练即可实现鲁棒的光照适应能力。

Conclusion: DIME-Net在统一处理复杂光照条件的图像增强中表现出色，其设计理念和结果表明其在实际多媒体应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer (ViT) 的新方法ViT-FIQA，用于预测人脸识别中的图像质量，并通过实验验证其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流的人脸图像质量评估方法主要基于卷积神经网络(CNN)，研究较少探索Vision Transformer(ViT)的潜力。

Method: 通过扩展标准ViT骨干网络，引入可学习质量token与普通patch tokens结合，通过全局自注意力机制处理，网络由两个分支构成：一是用于学习特征表示的分支，采用softmax损失；二是用于质量预测的回归分支。

Result: 在大量挑战性基准和人脸识别模型(CNN和ViT架构)上的实验表明，ViT-FIQA始终实现顶级性能。

Conclusion: ViT模型在建模人脸图像质量方面效果显著，展示了其作为未来FIQA研究中具有拓展潜力的基础架构的可能性。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的3D编码方式和自监督预训练方法，实现了自动驾驶车辆在250米内的高精度感知，适用于远距离高速公路场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数感知方法主要关注50-100米的短距离范围，而城市之外，高速公路场景对自动驾驶的要求远高于此。大重量卡车的惯性较高，也需要较长的规划范围。

Method: 基于稀疏表示，提出了一种高效的多模态和时间特征3D编码方式，并引入了一个自监督预训练方法，从未标注的摄像头和激光雷达数据中进行大规模学习。

Result: 将感知距离扩展到250米，并在目标检测的mAP上提升了26.6%，同时在激光雷达预测的Chamfer Distance上降低了30.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了高速公路远距离感知能力，在自动驾驶场景中具有显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法通过关键帧与非关键帧的有效整合，解决了现有方法场景重建中不完整的问题，为高效的场景理解提供了新的方向。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Motivation: 现有的对比学习数据中毒攻击效果有限，需要克服后门与目标对象之间的隐含联系及后门图像中判别特征抑制不充分的问题。

Method: 通过分析对比学习的随机裁剪机制，提出了一种噪声对齐方法。将这一过程形式化为图像布局优化问题，从理论上推导出最优参数。

Result: 与现有方法相比，Noisy Alignment达到了最先进的攻击效果，同时在干净数据上的表现没有降低，并能抵抗常见的后门防御。

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment提供了一种简单而有效的方法，显著提升了对比学习数据中毒攻击的效果，并具备鲁棒性和可行性。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense

Result: 实验表明，该方法在渲染质量、姿态精度和计算效率方面均优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: LongSplat成功解决了长视频新视图合成的挑战，为实现高质量的渲染和高效计算提供了新的方向。

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种扩展的基于角色的流程，用于检测和缓解大型文本语料中性别歧视的问题，并成功优化了德语报纸文章的性别平衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减少由于训练数据中的结构性性别失衡导致的大型语言模型输出中的性别偏见问题。

Method: 引入基于角色的指标对情感、句法表现和引用风格的不对称性进行分析；开发用于诊断语料库分析和排除性别偏见的新流程，以构建更公平的语料库。

Result: 在对德语报纸语料库的应用中，显著改善了多个语言维度的性别平衡，但发现细微的情感和框架偏见仍然存在。

Conclusion: 表面上的性别不对称问题可以通过过滤和重新平衡来解决，但更深层的偏见仍需采用进一步的研究和改进工具。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

TL;DR: 引入新的基准MM-BrowseComp，用于评估AI代理在多模态信息检索和推理中的能力，并发现现有先进模型在这一领域表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准主要评估AI的文本网页浏览能力，忽视了多模态内容的广泛性和重要性。

Method: 设计了包含224个问题的MM-BrowseComp基准，这些问题结合了多模态元素（如图像和视频）并提供核验清单，用于对多模态依赖和推理路径进行精细分析。

Result: 对当前最先进模型进行评估（如OpenAI o3 with tools），其在MM-BrowseComp上的准确率仅为29.02%，显示出模型在多模态能力上的不足。

Conclusion: 现有模型无法有效处理多模态任务，需进一步提升其原生多模态推理能力。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种同时翻译方法，专注于在实时、设备端语音翻译中平衡翻译质量与延迟，显著超过基线表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RNN-T的ASR系统已能支持实时转录，但实现高效、实时的流式翻译仍存巨大挑战，需要新方法优化翻译质量与延迟的平衡。

Method: 研究结合ASR与MT技术，并提出使用ASR的语言提示优化上下文管理，同时通过时间限制和强制结束的束搜索剪枝技术提升效率。

Result: 方法在设备端的双语对话语音翻译中表现优越，不仅缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距，还改善了延迟和翻译效果。

Conclusion: 新方法为更准确、高效的实时语音翻译提供了可行的路径，展示了流式翻译系统改进的潜力。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了推理能力对大语言模型(LLMs)在成语检测任务中的表现影响，以及模型大小的作用，发现大的模型在成语理解上表现更好，而小模型在提供定义提示下也能有所改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型通过推理能力提升成语检测性能的可能性以及模型大小对成语理解的影响。

Method: 利用DeepSeek-R1系列模型（从1.5B到70B参数）在四个成语检测数据集上进行实验，比较不同模型大小和推理处理对其性能的影响。

Result: 较小模型通过提供推理链条能有所提升但仍低于基础模型水平，而较大模型（14B、32B、70B参数）则显示适度改进。大模型具备较强的成语理解能力，而小模型通常错误理解，但通过定义提示可在一些情况下改进表现。

Conclusion: 大模型在成语检测任务中具有更好的推理和理解能力，而合理提示和定义信息有助于弥补小模型的不足。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过将LLaMA模型的上下文知识蒸馏到Whisper中来提升ASR系统的语法和语义准确性，尤其针对长音频转录任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ASR系统难以在长音频转录中保持语法和语义准确度，影响命名实体识别（NER）、大写化和标点等任务。

Method: 采用两种策略改进ASR：1) 使用最优传输进行维度和序列长度对齐的词级蒸馏；2) 在句子嵌入间最小化表示损失以融合语法和语义。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示Word Error Rate（WER）、NER、大写化和标点任务的显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER评估指标并探索语义感知的ASR模型，本文奠定了长音频转录中上下文感知和稳健ASR的基础。

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Datarus-R1-14B模型，这是一种14B参数的开源语言模型，能够作为虚拟数据分析师及研究生级别问题解决工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在处理复杂分析任务时存在局限性，例如缺乏逻辑推理能力和自动化工具集成，研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过从Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct模型进行微调，在金融、医学等领域的全分析轨迹数据上进行训练；结合轨迹生成器、双重奖励框架、GRPO优化法等多种策略提高模型性能；在推理接口中支持工具型使用和紧凑输出。

Result: Datarus在基准测试中超越了同尺寸模型，并在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench中达到更高准确率，同时解决方案生成效率更高。

Conclusion: Datarus在多领域复杂问题解决上展示了高效性能和较低冗余，克服了现有模型的许多挑战。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种低成本的解决方法，通过参数高效微调语言模型以增强其跨文化对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在跨文化交流中逐渐重要，但其行为仍受限于预训练语料中的语言和观点分布偏见，导致文化对齐困难。该研究旨在探索基于人类认知的有效学习方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过对本地语者的自由词联想规范进行监督微调(SFT)和基于PPO的偏好优化操作，使用Small-World-of-Words项目中的英语和中文数据，调整LLMs（如Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B）。

Result: 微调后，模型在词汇关联任务中表现显著提升，文化适应性增强：SFT提升了持出数据的关联精度，并改善了具体性和情感特征。同时，在基于文化价值调查的问题应答分布表现有所转移，显著减少模型的文化偏见。

Conclusion: 通过基于文化知识的少量关联数据的微调，7-8B模型的表现可以媲美甚至超越70B大型模型，展示了文化对齐的潜力和未来研究的必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProMed框架，通过强化学习让医疗大模型从被动回答转变为主动提问，提高临床决策准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型大多仅在被动模式下回答问题，缺乏主动提问能力，可能导致错误诊断。

Method: 引入了基于Shapley信息增益（SIG）的奖励机制，结合MCTS进行模型初始化以及SIG引导的强化学习策略优化。

Result: 在新创建的两个部分信息医疗基准上，ProMed方法比现有技术领先6.29%，较被动模式提高了54.45%。

Conclusion: ProMed显著提升了医疗模型的主动提问能力和决策准确性，并具有良好的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于私人收集的沙特方言指令数据集，对ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview进行LoRA微调以生成沙特方言文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前阿拉伯语言的大型语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA），对沙特方言（如Najdi和Hijazi）的支持较少，限制了捕捉真实方言变异的能力。

Method: 使用私人沙特方言指令数据集，研究两种微调方式：加入方言标签和不加标签，对模型进行LoRA调优。

Result: 带标签模型有效提升了沙特方言生成能力，提高沙特比例，降低MSA渗透率，同时改进文本保真度，优于其他强基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化微调方法，展示了LoRA技术在提升沙特方言生成和控制能力方面的效果，为沙特方言的多样性研究提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Result: 发现模型依赖于答案位置和干扰项模式进行多选题回答，并探讨了LLM评估与人类评估在低资源语言中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文认为精细化的评估对于理解模型局限性和开发更强大语言模型至关重要，为泰卢固语自然语言处理提供研究基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

Motivation: 探讨压缩深度学习模型在信任等价性上的表现，明确是否可以在资源受限环境下无缝替换原始大型模型。

Method: 提出一个两维框架评估信任等价性，通过LIME和SHAP测量解释性对齐性，使用ECE、MCE、Brier分数等指标评估校准相似性，并基于BERT-base及其压缩变体进行实验。

Result: 实验显示压缩模型与原始模型在解释性对齐性和置信度校准方面有显著差异，即使准确率接近。

Conclusion: 压缩模型不能与原始大型模型在信任上等同，以性能相等为基础的替换具有风险，需在部署前进行信任等价性评估。

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医疗领域对文本生成的准确性要求高，该研究旨在探索不同解码策略在医疗大模型下对任务表现的影响，弥补这一领域研究的不足。

Method: 分析了11种解码策略在五种医疗任务中的表现，包括翻译、摘要、问答、对话和图像描述，测试了医疗专用和通用语言模型的不同规模模型，并比较了多种评估指标的效果。

Result: 确定性解码方法（如束搜索）表现优于随机性方法，大规模模型表现最好但推理时间较长且对解码策略不够鲁棒，医疗专用模型在部分任务中优于通用模型，但整体没有显著优势。

Conclusion: 医疗应用中需慎重选择解码方法，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

Motivation: 文本生成的大语言模型表现出性别偏见，而语音语言模型是否也存在类似问题尚不明确。研究旨在通过分析语音模型的说话人分配来探讨性别偏见。

Method: 提出并应用了一种基于说话人分配的分析方法，同时构建与测试了两个数据集：职业数据集和带有性别暗示的文本数据集，用于分析TTS模型Bark的性别分配倾向。

Result: Bark未表现出系统性性别偏见，但模型显示出对性别的感知及某些性别倾向。

Conclusion: 尽管Bark在说话人分配上不存在系统性偏见，但其性别意识及倾向可能与训练数据或模型设计相关，应在未来进一步研究分析。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaDocVQA框架，解决低资源环境下的长文档视觉问答问题，展示在日文文档VQA基准上的新业界标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长文档视觉问答因上下文限制和训练数据不足，面临着显著挑战，尤其在低资源环境中，该研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出三项核心创新: (1) 混合文本检索架构进行高效文档分割；(2) 智能数据增强流水线，自动生成高质量的推理问答对；(3) 自适应集成推理机制，包含动态配置生成和提前停止功能。

Result: 在JDocQA基准上的是非题、事实题和数字题分别达到83.04%、52.66%和44.12%的准确率，在LAVA数据集上达到59%的准确率，并通过消融实验验证各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: AdaDocVQA框架显著提高了日文文档VQA性能，并为其他低资源语言与专业领域提供了可扩展的基础方案。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

*Tomer Ashuach,Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Martin Tutek,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CRISP方法，该方法通过稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）来实现持久性概念的去学习，避免了传统方法中参数易被恶意访问的问题，并在多层级上抑制显著的SAE特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，开发能够选择性移除不需要知识而保持模型效用的技术变得十分关键。现有方法多集中在推理阶段，导致模型参数不发生持久性变化，容易被篡改或逆转。

Method: 提出了一种名为CRISP的参数高效方法，基于稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）自动识别并抑制多层级具有代表性特征的激活值，从而实现持久的知识去学习。

Result: 实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试中优于现有方法，能够成功移除有害知识，同时保持模型的一般及域内能力，且在特征层次上实现了目标与无害概念之间的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种精准且持久的特征抑制方法，为安全关键任务下的概念去学习提供了新的解决方案，同时维持了模型的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型(VLMs)在低资源语言（越南语）多模态教育任务中的表现，通过新提出的ViExam基准评价了其在七个学术领域的表现。结果显示，现有VLM性能有限，部分模型略优于平均人类表现但远低于人类最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望探索主要用英语训练的VLMs是否能够处理现实生活中的跨语言多模态推理任务，从而评估其在低资源语言中的潜力。

Method: 提出了ViExam基准，包含2548道多模态问题，对多个最先进的VLMs以及开源模型进行了测试，并设置多种对比实验，如跨语言提示和人类协作。

Result: 现有的顶尖VLM平均准确率为57.74%，开源模型为27.70%，均低于人类平均表现的66.54%。只有一个模型性能略高于人类平均表现，但仍落后于人类最佳表现（99.60%）；跨语言提示的效果反而下降；而人类辅助可以使性能提高5个百分点。

Conclusion: 现有VLM无法有效处理越南语多模态教育任务，跨语言提示未见提升，但人类参与有助于改善性能。这表明进一步改进模型以适应低资源语言应用的必要性。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析LLMs处理复杂例外问题及其在默认推理、认知和概念获取中的应用潜力。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本提示方式(包括链式思考提示)，测试模型对可撤销推理与演绎推理的区分能力和对一般化陈述的理解。

Result: 一些前沿模型表现良好，但跨模型和提示风格表现差异显著。少样本提示部分提升性能，但链式思考提示反而导致较严重性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在默认推理中的潜力和局限性并存，仍需深入研究来提升其区分推理类型的能力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型中的知识编码，提高其可解释性，特别是通过分析词嵌入中的语义特征。

Method: 通过对现有将词嵌入映射到语义特征的方法进行评估，检验这些方法的预测效果，分析其是否真正反映了语义特征。

Result: 证明现有方法即使对随机信息也能有效预测，其结果更多反映了算法上界，而非语义表示的真实性。

Conclusion: 现有方法的预测性能无法可靠验证数据集和词嵌入间的语义关联，需重新评估词嵌入的语义特性。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Conclusion: EEG-MedRAG在高效处理和解读EEG数据方面表现出了显著优势，为临床场景中的决策支持提供了一种新颖的解决方案，其数据和代码已经公开。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中迎合用户错误观念的倾向，即阿谀行为，并提出了一种新的评估框架和改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型倾向于迎合用户错误观念的行为虽然能提升用户满意度，但在高风险领域如科学问答中可能带来严重后果。

Method: 设计了一个统一评估框架，以量化阿谀行为对科学问答任务的影响，并提出Pressure-Tune方法，通过对抗性对话和逐步推理增强模型的事实一致性。

Result: 评估结果显示，模型的阿谀行为主要与对用户满意度的优化策略有关。Pressure-Tune显著提升了模型在抗阿谀的同时保持高准确性和反馈响应性。

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune方法为提高模型真实度和原则性提供了有效实用的路径，尤其在科学问答这样的高风险场景中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法MGT-Prism，通过频域分析解决机器生成文本检测的领域泛化问题，实验结果显示出色的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器生成文本检测方法在相同领域内有效，但在跨领域检测中表现较差，因此需要更好地解决领域泛化问题。

Method: 利用文本表示的频域分析，设计低频域过滤模块和动态频谱对齐策略，以提取任务相关且领域不变的特征，从而提高检测性能。

Result: 实验表明，MGT-Prism在11个测试数据集上的准确率和F1分数均优于当前最先进的基线方法，分别提升了0.90%和0.92%。

Conclusion: MGT-Prism显著改善了机器生成文本检测的领域泛化能力，为文本生成相关的研究和应用带来了新启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在教育中的作用，评估其生成的文本是否能模仿儿童语言。

Method: 使用两种提示（零样本和少样本）生成LLMs文本，并与德语儿童描述的故事文本进行心理语言学属性比较，分析词频、词汇丰富度、句长、词长和语义相似性等。

Result: LLMs生成的文本较长但词汇较不丰富，偏向高频词，名词使用不足，语义相似性较低。少样本提示略微提高相似性，但仍难以复制儿童的词汇和语义模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示LLMs模仿儿童语言的局限性，并对其在心理语言学研究和教育中的适用性提出了反思。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Result: 实验验证了TracSum基准的有效性，显示句子级追踪可以增强生成摘要的准确性，完整上下文信息提升摘要完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum是一种有效的追溯性摘要评估工具，追踪与上下文结合可以提升医疗摘要生成的质量。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在道德维度理解上的表现，尤其是相较于人类的能力表现，并捕捉人类与模型在不确定性方面的差异。

Method: 使用大规模贝叶斯评估方法，分析了Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick等模型，基于250K+注释数据和700名标注者的输入进行实验，处理了超过1M模型查询。

Result: AI模型在实验中的道德检测能力排名通常位列人类评估者的前25%，表现出高于平均水平的平衡准确率，并且产生的假阴性结果显著少于人类标注。

Conclusion: AI模型在道德检测中的敏感性高于人类，在道德维度理解上显示出优越性能，且能较好解决不确定性问题。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示的策略，使大语言模型能够在没有微调或迭代采样的情况下生成精确长度的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型难以严格控制生成文本的长度，提出改进方案是为了解决此问题。

Method: 通过提供计数规则和倒计时标记的提示，使模型在生成文本时同时进行计数，从而达到精确的长度控制。

Result: 在多个生成和任务设置下，这种提示显著提高了模型的长度遵从度，尤其是在MT-Bench-LI任务中，从低于30%提高到超过95%，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 仅通过提示工程就能实现精确的长度控制，这是一种相较于训练或解码方法更轻量的替代方案。

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Motivation: 传统人类评估昂贵且不具扩展性，现有自动评估指标无法全面捕捉文本质量且方法多样化缺乏规范，研究试图揭示这些问题并提出更好的优化方向。

Method: 通过系统审查现有评估指标的方法学、优缺点、验证方式以及与人类判断的相关性，全面分析评估手段以及其对特定任务和数据集的有效性。

Result: 发现现有评估方法，包括最新的基于大语言模型的评估（LLM-as-a-Judge），普遍在捕捉文本质量的特定维度、任务适配性以及验证规范性等方面存在不足，且与人类主观评价的相关性不一致。

Conclusion: 不存在‘完美的’自动评估指标，应根据具体任务采用针对性指标并结合多样化评估。新指标开发需重视验证方法的改进，以推进更精确的质量评估体系的构建。

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the

### [111] [MME-SCI: A Comprehensive and Challenging Science Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13938)
*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MME-SCI的新基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，尤其是在多语言场景和科学知识点的细粒度评估方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在多语言场景的推理能力评估、多模态覆盖的全面性及科学知识点的细粒度标注方面存在不足。

Method: 作者设计了MME-SCI基准，包括1019个高质量问答对，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四门学科，支持五种语言（中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、日文）并涉及三种评估模式。对20种模型进行了广泛实验。

Result: 在图像评估模式下，现有模型的表现普遍不佳，如o4-mini在数学、物理、化学和生物精准度分别为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，远低于其他基准的难度水平。

Conclusion: MME-SCI有效揭示了现有模型在特定领域的不足，推动了多模态大语言模型的进一步研究。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReviewGraph的新框架，通过将文本客户评论转化为知识图谱来预测评级，并在性能与计算成本之间实现了良好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在酒店行业，理解客户评论评分的驱动因素对于提高客户满意度和经营业绩至关重要。

Method: 通过提取“三元组”并结合情感分数构建知识图谱，利用图嵌入（Node2Vec）和情感特征，通过机器学习分类器预测评分，同时与传统NLP方法和大语言模型进行性能对比实验。

Result: ReviewGraph的预测性能与大语言模型相当，在一致性指标（如Cohen's Kappa）上表现优于传统基线方法，并且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: 表明基于图形的表示方法在增强评论分析方面具有潜力，可提供更高的解释性、可视化探索以及与检索增强生成系统（RAG）的可能集成。

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Motivation: 为了解决长上下文任务中由于合成数据多样性低和事实不一致性导致的效果限制问题。

Method: 使用多臂赌博机方法对上下文切块进行奖励评分选择，并生成高质量和多样性响应后应用直接偏好优化（DPO）进行模型增强。

Result: 实验表明LongMab-PO在长上下文推理基准上取得了最新的最佳表现。

Conclusion: LongMab-PO能够显著提高偏好数据对的多样性和质量，为长上下文建模提供强有力支持。

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 提出了SvS策略来改进RLVR训练,通过自我改进策略保持策略熵并显著提升Pass@k性能,在AIME等基准测试中取得了显著结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准RLVR训练中由于策略熵降低导致的生成多样性减少问题,并改善Pass@k表现。

Method: 使用在线自对弈结合变分问题生成(SvS)策略,通过从模型生成的正确解决方案中合成变分问题,同时确保参考答案与原始问题一致。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准测试中,Pass@32性能分别提升了18.3%和22.8%,在12个推理基准测试上表现出良好的泛化和稳健性。

Conclusion: 通过引入SvS策略,显著改进了RLVR训练的性能,提升了复杂推理任务中模型的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析如何在LLMs微调过程中避免模型因完成复杂任务而变得不匹配甚至会执行有害任务的风险。

Method: 提出一种名为Prefix INjection Guard (PING)的方法，该方法通过自动生成自然语言前缀并附加在模型的响应中，改进其对有害请求的拒绝能力，同时保证模型在常规任务中的性能。

Result: 实验显示，PING在增强微调LLMs的安全性方面效果显著，且在网络导航和代码生成任务的多个基准测试中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PING方法不仅能有效提升模型安全性，还不影响其任务执行能力，同时揭示了前缀对修改模型内部行为的关键作用。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在医疗保健领域受到数据短缺和隐私限制的挑战，而在线健康社区的复杂文本分析则需要高水平的专门知识。研究旨在探索如何利用LLMs来解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了一种编码专家解读准则的结构化代码本，通过情境学习促使LLMs应用领域专门知识，并与多种语言模型和传统方法进行比较分析。

Result: LLMs在包括GPT和DeepSeek等模型中表现出色，与专家之间的标注一致性达到无显著差异的水平，并优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LLMs为复杂健康数据提供了可扩展、高质量的分析解决方案，缓解了数字健康研究中专家知识不足的关键挑战，具有实时健康监测和策略评估的潜力。

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然LLMs的上下文学习能力令人印象深刻，但其内部机制仍不清楚。物理任务因具有可实验性和结构性，为研究LLMs中的推理行为提供了理想测试平台。

Method: 利用动力预测任务作为代理，分析模型的残差流激活，通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）研究LLMs的上下文学习能力，考察其对物理规律的理解。

Result: 发现在更长的输入上下文下，模型的动力预测性能有所提高，并且稀疏自编码器捕获的特征与重要物理变量（如能量）相关。

Conclusion: LLMs能在上下文学习中编码有意义的物理概念，研究为理解其学习机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AHD方法受到静态操作符和缺乏知识积累机制的限制，需突破相关瓶颈。

Method: 设计了HiFo-Prompt框架，通过前瞻型（Foresight）提示动态管理搜索方向和平衡探索与开发，通过后见型（Hindsight）提示将历史成功经验浓缩为可重复使用的设计原则，从而形成知识积累机制。

Result: 实验证明HiFo-Prompt在生成高质量启发式策略、收敛速度及查询效率上均超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt框架通过两种提示策略的协同作用，使LLM能够自我学习和知识积累，为AHD提供了高效率的新方法。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在上下文管理方面存在根本性限制，无法模拟人类动态的任务驱动记忆管理。

Method: 提出Cognitive Workspace，包含主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲区和任务驱动的上下文优化三大核心创新。

Result: 实验表明Cognitive Workspace的记忆重用率达58.6%，效率提升17-18%，统计显著性p<0.001。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace是从信息检索到认知增强的范式转变，为LLM系统带来了定量证据支持的主动记忆优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Alpha挖掘评估中存在计算开销大、指标单一且大多为闭源的问题，这限制了模型评估效率及研究进展。

Method: AlphaEval通过五个维度：预测能力、稳定性、市场扰动下的鲁棒性、金融逻辑及多样性，来提供全面的Alpha评估。在无需回测的情况下并行执行模型分析，并通过开源工具促进复现和社区参与。

Conclusion: AlphaEval为Alpha挖掘提供了一种高效、开放且综合的评估框架，克服了传统方法的局限性，推动了该领域的研究和应用。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Result: 精确确定了计算复杂度，设计算法并分析了本体和TGDs大小。此外，对于有限结构的概念包含与TGDs，证明了部分场景存在有限基础但部分场景不存在。

Conclusion: 部分描述逻辑和TGDs能够为给定结构提供有限基础，但某些复杂TGDs无法构造有限基础，为相关领域算法设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,

TL;DR: 本文提出了CESQL模型，通过结合模型可解释性分析与执行引导策略改善SQL查询中的WHERE子句语义解析，在WikiSQL数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升文本到SQL模型在实际应用中的基本能力和泛化能力，减少对手动标注数据的依赖。

Method: 集成模型可解释性分析与执行引导策略，并采用过滤调整、逻辑关联优化和模型融合等方法设计CESQL模型。

Result: CESQL模型在WikiSQL数据集上显著提高了预测准确率，尤其在WHERE子句条件值的预测中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅减少了对条件列数据的依赖，还避免了手动标注数据的影响，为研究复杂查询和处理不规则数据提供了新视角。

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了搜索型大语言模型(LLM)代理中的搜索时间污染(STC)问题，即模型通过在线搜索找到含有问题及答案的来源导致评估结果失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究评估时的搜索污染（STC）问题，以解决现有基准因数据污染而丧失有效性的风险。

Method: 通过实验分析常用评估基准的污染比例和模型性能变化，提出解决STC问题的实践方案并公开实验日志以供审查。

Result: 大约3%的测试问题受到STC影响，屏蔽污染来源后模型在此类问题上的准确率下降约15%。

Conclusion: STC问题严重威胁基准可信度，需采取合理数据设计和结果报告实践以维持评估可靠性。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QuickMerge的轻量级token合并框架，用于提高生成模型的下一个token预测效率，动态选择重要的tokens，从而减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高生成模型在语言、视觉、视频等领域的高效性，尤其是在广泛使用的下一个token预测中减轻计算负载。

Method: 提出了QuickMerge，通过注意力范数的动态选择减少tokens数量，同时使用基于熵的预算估算器和一个针对合并后的token序列训练的轻量级transformer前馈架构。

Result: QuickMerge在多模态领域中实现了更好的计算-精度权衡，在减少token数量的同时等效或超越了现有的tokenizer和固定patch基线方法。

Conclusion: QuickMerge证明了在确保生成模型精度的同时也能大大减少计算开销，适用于多模态场景。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在人类与AI下国际象棋战略决策中的即时机会与长期目标的权衡，发现顶级AI能维持更长时间的战略张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过理解国际象棋中人类与AI在战略决策上的差异，为AI在复杂战略环境中的应用提供见解。

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子交互度量方法，分析棋盘上的战略张力动态变化，并对比了人类与AI的棋局演变。

Result: 顶级AI玩家能维持更高层次的战略张力更长时间，而人类玩家倾向于限制张力与游戏复杂性；战略张力与Elo等级有关，在1600和2300评分附近有突增。

Conclusion: AI在复杂战略环境中表现出更高的适应性，而人类则受限于认知能力，这种差异对AI的应用有潜在启示。

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中的记忆功能多注重偏好匹配和简单问答，难以满足需要对大量用户信息进行多跳推理的复杂任务需求。

Method: 提出多跳个性化推理任务，构建数据集与统一评估框架，测试并分析显式与隐式记忆方法，提出混合记忆模型HybridMem。

Result: 混合内存方法（HybridMem）通过实验展现了其在多跳个性化推理任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: HybridMem有效弥补了显式与隐式记忆机制的局限性，为大语言模型个性化推理提供了新方法和评估框架。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前有大量材料数据存在于科学文献的非结构化图表中，阻碍了基于大语言模型的人工智能系统在材料设计中的应用，需开发能够提取这些数据的有效工具。

Method: 提出DIVE多智能体工作流，专注于从图形化科学文献中提取和组织实验数据，并进行准确性验证。

Result: 在固态储氢材料的案例中，DIVE的提取准确性比商用模型高10-15%，比开源模型高30%以上；基于30000多个数据条目建立的数据库实现了快速逆向设计。

Conclusion: 该工作流和智能体设计方法具有通用性，为人工智能驱动的材料发现提供了一种新范式。

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents 改善了心血管疾病检测的自动化及适应性，为AI在临床的实际应用开拓了可能性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LOOP的新型神经-符号规划框架，通过神经网络与符号组件的迭代对话实现更可靠的规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经规划方法在复杂问题上的局限，填补神经与符号方法协作不足的空白。

Method: 设计了一种迭代式的神经-符号规划框架，包括13种神经特性，如图神经网络、多代理验证、层级分解和因果记忆等。

Result: 在6个标准IPC基准域中，LOOP的成功率达到85.8%，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LOOP证明了神经与符号方法协作的核心价值，为可信的自动化系统提供了完整方案。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态PEFT方法虽然能提升特定任务性能，但忽视了模态嵌入空间的结构，导致跨模态泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使不同模态输入在统一语义空间中聚合并支持扩展至更多模态。

Result: SPANER在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中表现出色，实现高少样本检索性能且保持语义嵌入一致性。

Conclusion: 强调模态嵌入结构对齐的重要性，SPANER展现了扩展性和提升多模态学习能力的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融表格结构复杂且数据分散，从中提取标准化信息极具挑战性，需要一个智能的解决方案来自动化处理和标准化输出。

Method: 该方法引入了一个名为TASER的系统，使用表代理来执行表格检测、分类、提取和推荐，并通过连续学习过程改进输出效果和推荐的可操作性。

Result: TASER系统在提取金融表格时表现优越，相较现有的表检测模型如Table Transformer提高了10.1%的性能，还证明较大的批量训练可以显著提升推荐的可用性。

Conclusion: TASER通过引入智能表代理和连续学习过程，为金融数据表的提取和理解提供了强大的工具，同时其开放的数据集也为相关研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

Motivation: 研究最小化约束最大违规的离散赋值问题，应用于满足最差情况性能需求的多种场景。

Method: 定义DMMV问题，并开发基于DMMV数学性质的GPU加速启发式算法，提升求解效率。通过三个实际优化问题验证算法适用性。

Result: 在模型量化中，启发式方法平均性能提升14%；离散层析中在统一噪声下误差降低16%且计算速度提升6倍；FIR滤波器设计中相比商业解算器涟漪幅度几乎减小一半。

Conclusion: DMMV作为无上下文优化问题具有重要价值，所提出的启发式算法对多类问题具有显著性能提升，代码开源将进一步推动此领域研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the

*Yuzhi Tang,Tianxiao Li,Elizabeth Li,Chris J. Maddison,Honghua Dong,Yangjun Ruan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 语言模型（LM）代理在执行任务时表现出强大能力，但在安全场景中存在显著风险和缺陷。虽然代理具备高水平的风险知识，但在实际任务中未能有效识别风险或避免危险操作。提出了一种风险验证框架，大幅减少了危险操作的执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于语言模型代理在现实任务和安全场景的潜在风险，研究试图揭示其知识与实际行为间的差距，同时开发方法减轻安全隐患。

Method: 研究开发了一个三维评估框架，逐级分析代理的风险知识、对执行轨迹中风险的识别能力及避免风险的实际行为。并基于观察到的性能差距，设计了抽象器-验证器系统改善模型安全性能。

Result: 评估显示，尽管语言模型代理具备高风险知识，面对实际情境识别风险的表现下降显著，且危险行为仍在部分执行。而提出的验证器系统将危险行为减少了55.3%。

Conclusion: 简单扩大模型能力无法消除安全问题，但通过独立验证与抽象描述的结合，有效改善了语言模型代理在执行任务中的安全性能。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minecraft的复杂性和数据规模适合智能体研究，但由于速度过慢和工程复杂性，其在快速原型开发中的适用性受到限制。因此，需要一个更轻量的替代方案来支持通用智能体研究。

Conclusion: CrafterDojo成功解锁了Crafter作为通用智能体研究平台的潜力，使其成为快速原型开发和广泛研究的高效测试环境。

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的两阶段训练框架EAG-RL，通过专家注意力引导增强大语言模型(LLMs)的电子健康记录(EHR)推理能力，实验显示显著提高了LLMs的推理性能与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在EHR推理任务中表现不足，现有方法多依赖混合范式，导致LLMs推理能力无法增强且继续受限于深度学习模型的泛化问题。

Method: 提出EAG-RL框架，首先通过专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索生成高质量推理轨迹以初始化LLM策略，然后利用强化学习优化LLMs策略，强调其注意力对临床重要特征的对齐。

Result: 在两个真实世界的EHR数据集上的实验结果表明，EAG-RL使LLMs的EHR推理能力平均提高了14.62%，并增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性及对未见临床领域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，通过内在推理能力的提升弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been
available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了强化学习在需要深入理解信息丰富图片并生成结构化输出任务中的应用，特别是提出了处理图表到代码生成任务的多模态结构化强化学习模型（MSRL）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法（SFT）在处理复杂的图表到代码生成任务时性能存在瓶颈，需要一种有效的强化学习方法来提升生成性能。

Method: 提出了多模态结构化强化学习（MSRL），通过文本和视觉层面上的细粒度奖励机制提升模型表现，并采用两阶段学习课程以保证训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试中分别实现了6.2%和9.9%的高指标提升，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: MSRL打破了SFT的性能瓶颈，为图表到代码生成任务提供了一个性能更强的解决方案，展示了强化学习在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Valley-to-Peak (V2P)的方法，通过抑制背景干扰和改进交互建模，提高了GUI元素定位的精度，在两个基准上分别取得了92.3%和50.5%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高GUI代理在界面元素精准定位中的性能，解决现有方法忽略背景区域及中心-边缘区分不佳的问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法，通过引入抑制注意力机制减少对背景区域的干扰，并采用基于Fitts法则的2D高斯热图建模来区分目标的中心和边缘区域。

Result: V2P在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro基准上分别取得92.3%和50.5%的性能，同时验证了各组件对性能的贡献和方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: V2P通过抑制背景干扰和基于高斯权重分布的方法，有效提升了模型在GUI元素定位任务中的精确性，表现出良好的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决知识图谱查询中软约束问题的方法，开发了神经查询重排序器（NQR），该方法在改进答案分数的同时保持查询结果的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要集中在一阶逻辑形式化的查询上，但现实中很多查询涉及模糊或上下文相关的限制，如对属性或类别的偏好，该问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出神经查询重排序器（NQR），通过用户交互逐步调整答案分数，以引入软约束，同时保持对原始查询答案的准确性。

Result: 通过生成包含软约束的数据集扩展现有基准并进行实验，结果表明NQR能够在捕捉软约束的同时，维持强健的查询回答性能。

Conclusion: NQR方法有效提升了处理软约束查询的能力，为知识图谱的实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: 提出的ITL-LIME方法有效克服了传统LIME在数据稀缺环境下的局限性，同时提升了解释的保真度和稳定性。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效提升第三方简历数据的质量，为企业人才库提供更精确的数据支持，在简历去重任务中表现出色。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为CausalPlan的框架，通过结构化因果推理提高大语言模型在协作任务中的表现，尤其是在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在协作任务中因缺乏因果推理能力，常产生无效或不连贯的行动，限制了其协调与规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，核心是基于结构性因果动作模型（SCA），通过学习从环境轨迹中提取因果图，然后为LLM建议的行动分配因果评分，从而指导行动选择，并在必要时选择基于因果的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，CausalPlan在五种多代理协调任务和不同规模的LLM上均表现优异，能够减少无效行动并改善AI-AI和人-AI协作，超过了一些强化学习的强基线方法。

Conclusion: 因果驱动的规划方法能够提升多代理大语言模型系统的效率、可解释性和泛化性能，证明了因果性在多代理任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一LLM模型由于知识局限性和静态训练数据，难以高效处理复杂、多样的临床信息。

Method: EMRC通过两个阶段运行：1.基于公开语料库构建LLM专长表动态选择最优的模型作为医疗代理；2.结合模型生成的自信分数，通过置信度融合和对抗验证提升诊断可靠性。

Result: 在三个公共MDM数据集上的实验结果表明，EMRC超过了单一和多LLM方法，尤其在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上表现出2.69%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: EMRC凭借专长感知的代理招募策略和多模型协同，显著提升了医学决策的效果，展示了多模型协作的潜力。

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过集成多个RAG系统来增强适应性和任务表现，提供了理论与机制分析视角，并通过实验证明集成方法的通用性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一的RAG框架难以适应多种下游任务，因此需要探索结合多个RAG系统以充分利用其各自优势的方法。

Method: 进行了综合研究，提出RAG系统集成框架的理论与机制分析，从信息熵的角度首次解释了框架的理论基础，并从流水线和模块两个层面设计四种流水线（Branching, Iterative, Loop, Agentic）和三种模块（Generator, Retriever, Reranker），用以解决七个研究问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，无论在流水线还是模块层面，集成多个RAG系统均表现出良好的通用性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文为多RAG系统集成领域的研究提供了基础，验证了集成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Motivation: 以往研究显示，当生成的策略不正确时，派生的通用计划将出错。这种限制促进了引入更健壮的策略生成与调试机制的需求。

Method: 改进流程包括生成伪代码、引入伪代码的自动调试步骤、扩展Python程序的调试阶段以进行失败原因反思。此外，通过从多个程序变体中选择最佳版本以生成更高质量的通用计划。

Result: 实验结果证明，在17个基准域上，该方法显著提高了通用计划的质量，其中12个域能完全解决所有测试任务。

Conclusion: 通过引入伪代码调试和反思机制并优选多版本代码，该方法有效地提升了LLMs生成PDDL通用计划的可靠性与性能。

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TS-Agent的模块化智能框架，用于优化金融领域时间序列建模工作流，其表现优于现有的AutoML和智能代理基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列建模在金融决策中至关重要，但高性能且可解释的模型开发仍是挑战。此外，现有的AutoML框架适应性欠佳，难以满足领域特定需求。

Method: 设计了TS-Agent框架，将时间序列建模流程分为模型选择、代码优化和微调三个阶段，由上下文推理和实验反馈引导。核心组件为具备知识库和模型库的规划代理，支持自适应学习、调试及审计。

Conclusion: TS-Agent提供了一种高效透明的解决方案，可提升金融应用中时间序列建模的表现，尤其适用于高风险环境。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI代理在多层供应链中的合作行为和潜在不稳定性，如牛鞭效应。

Method: 在模拟供应链环境中对基于大语言模型（LLMs）驱动的生成式AI代理行为进行实验，分析其行为模式。

Result: 发现了“协作悖论”，即理论上更优秀的协作AI代理因库存囤积导致系统表现不如非AI基准。提出通过高层政策制定与低层协作执行的结合来解决问题。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了协作AI代理的潜在缺陷，并提出了实现供应链稳定性的框架，为AI驱动的商业分析系统设计提供指导。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Result: 实验数据表明 BRKGA 在解决 LRS 问题上达到了先进水平，但对于大字母表输入仍需进一步提升。

Conclusion: 偏随机键遗传算法（BRKGA）对 LRS 问题是一种有效的解决方法，但需优化应对规模更大的问题。

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Conclusion: 通过引入ComputerRL和Entropulse训练策略，证明了其在提升桌面自动化任务性能上的显著进步，同时为通用智能代理发展提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et

Method: 提出BERT-VQA模型，其基于VisualBERT，结合了预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器和可能的联合融合模块，并与基线模型（LSTM、CNN和浅分类器）进行训练与测试。

Result: 最终结果表明，VisualBERT的跨模态模块对于对齐图表内容与问题短语并非必需。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了图表问答挑战的难度，同时评估了一些模型架构在解决该问题时的适用性。

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提升了AutoML搜索效率并在不显著降低预测性能的情况下优化了搜索过程，验证了元学习在AutoML中的实用性。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

Result: 研究表明，训练点的分布对解决方案的精度具有显著影响；某些分布策略与微分方程的特性相关性较强。

Conclusion: 通过调整训练点分布，物理信息神经网络可以更好地求解具有特定特性的微分方程。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Conclusion: DGNPP通过捕获网络拓扑结构和动态变化，克服了传统方法的局限性，有效提升了TIN的预测能力。

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLM）在处理情感分类、情境驱动的目标检测等复杂任务时表现不佳，原因在于现有方法难以进行高质量逻辑推理。此类问题需要构建模型能理解图像深层语义并推理的能力。

Method: 提出RISE框架，分为两个阶段：（1）Reason阶段：通过强化学习生成逻辑一致的链式推理（CoTs），保证其能够重构原始标注；（2）Inspire和Strengthen阶段：采用经过奖励机制筛选的高质量CoT进行监督和强化微调，训练出具有高解释性和高准确度的VLM。

Result: 在复杂和简单的图像标注任务上，经过RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型优于标准监督微调（SFT）和现有的视觉强化微调（Visual-RFT），表现出更强的鲁棒性和解释性。

Conclusion: RISE框架为提升视觉语言模型推理能力提供了一个无需手动标注链式推理的自监督解决方案，可在复杂视觉任务中实现专家级表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,

demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理仿真的数据增强方法（PPDA），通过更真实的数据生成策略，显著提升了传感器驱动的人类活动识别（HAR）模型的性能，尤其在数据稀缺的情境下表现尤为突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器驱动的HAR领域由于高质量标签数据稀缺，导致模型性能受限，尤其在应对实际应用的广泛变化时受到影响。因此，需要一种有效的数据增强策略以增加训练数据的多样性和可用性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Physically Plausible Data Augmentation（PPDA）的方法，通过物理仿真模型生成更真实的传感器数据。这些仿真从人体动作数据出发，模拟了包括身体运动变化、传感器位置变化以及硬件相关影响等多种因素，旨在保证生成数据的物理合理性。

Result: 实验结果表明，PPDA显著提升了模型的宏F1分数，平均提升了3.7个百分点，最高提升可达13个百分点。此外，与传统数据增强相比，PPDA方法在训练数据减少60%的情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统研究了PPDA在HAR领域的应用，验证了物理合理性在数据增强中的优势以及物理仿真在生成合成数据中的潜力，为应对HAR中标签稀缺问题提供了成本低且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的协作匹配系统 (comatch)，通过结合算法和人的决策来优化匹配效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的匹配系统无法有效结合人类和算法的能力，从而难以提高决策的质量。

Method: 设计了一种协作匹配系统 (comatch)，算法只做它最有把握的决定，其他则交由人类决策，并通过优化分配来最大化总体性能。

Result: 在人类参与的实验中，comatch生成的匹配结果优于单独的算法或人类的决策。

Conclusion: comatch系统在结合人类与AI的决策能力方面证明了自己的有效性，为重要领域的匹配问题提供了新方法。

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种新的方法“HCC”，在传统共形预测方法中纳入了类别的语义层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形预测未能利用类别标签之间的领域知识和层次关系，从而限制了预测集的表达能力。

Method: 提出了“HCC”，将问题转化为一个带有约束条件的优化问题，优化生成兼具语义与层次信息的预测集，且保证覆盖率。

Result: 通过音频、图像和文本数据的实验验证了方法的优越性，同时通过用户研究表明层次化预测集优于传统扁平集。

Conclusion: HCC在保持覆盖率的同时增强了预测集的语义表达能力并得到了用户的优良反馈。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在约束样本生成领域表现优秀，并指出未来研究方向，同时提供代码供研究者使用。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

Result: 证明了所提出的方法在玩具环境中的有效性，并对更一般性的挑战进行了形式化探索。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，通过学习算法能有效促进语言获取。

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种融合动态图构建与时空注意力机制的新框架，用于自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）的诊断，在ABIDE数据集上表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI分类方法难以全面捕获时空关系，本研究旨在通过动态图和时空注意机制改善诊断精度。

Method: 利用基于transformer的注意力机制动态推断脑功能连接，并构建随时间变化的图表；随后结合图卷积网络（GCN）与transformers处理这些时间变化图表以捕获局部和全局时空依赖关系。

Result: 在ABIDE子数据集上达到63.2的准确率和60.0的AUC，优于静态图方法如GCN的51.8。

Conclusion: 动态连接与时空上下文联合建模对fMRI分类有效，验证了注意力驱动动态图构建和GCN-transformer融合的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Method: 提出 X-MoE 系统，采用无填充训练、跳过冗余分发和基于序列切分的混合并行技术，并支持跨平台优化。

Result: 在 AMD MI250X GPU 驱动的 Frontier 超算上，X-MoE 能扩展至 1024 个 GPU 训练 5450 亿参数模型，比现有方法规模提升 10 倍，同时保持高吞吐率。

Conclusion: X-MoE 显著改进了下一代 MoE 架构的训练能力，为更大规模和高效的模型训练提供了方案并开放代码。

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,

that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究目的是利用时间-频率分析和空间指标优化癫痫发作起始区域的定位准确性，特别针对外科手术成功和无发作的患者。

Method: 提出了两步法：1. 使用局部异常因子（LOF）进行无监督异常检测，根据频谱时间特征找到异常通道；2. 进行空间相关分析，结合电极接近性计算加权匹配指标。

Result: LOF方法对检测异常表现良好，加权匹配指标比精确匹配更有效。完全无发作及手术成功患者表现出高精确度，而失败患者中一致性较低。

Conclusion: 基于信号'振动啁啾'的异常检测结合空间加权分析，是对癫痫起始区域定位的一种有效补充方法，特别适用于外科手术成功患者。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出MAVIS，一种无需修改基础模型权重，能够实现在推理阶段动态调整LLM行为的轻量级对齐框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大语言模型在多目标场景下的输出，以实现多目标之间的平衡，并减少因单独微调模型而产生的计算成本和灵活性问题。

Method: 设计了MAVIS框架，通过训练多个小型价值模型反映不同目标，用户可在推理阶段动态结合这些模型，并使用一种递归算法保证KL正则化策略的单调改进。

Result: 实验表明，MAVIS优于逐目标微调后合并的基准方法，并接近针对用户偏好精细微调模型的效果。

Conclusion: MAVIS实现了无需修改模型权重即可动态控制LLM行为的有效方法，为多目标对齐提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于融合时间序列与文本事件的生成框架EventTSF，用于解决非平稳时间序列预测的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的时间序列预测方法大多依赖于单一模态，未能有效利用文本等外部事件提供的上下文信息，特别是在非平稳动态下的提升存在较大潜力。

Method: 本文提出了一个名为EventTSF的模型框架，结合历史时间序列与文本事件，通过自回归扩散与流匹配捕捉时序与事件之间的细粒度交互，使用多模态U型扩散变压器实现高效的数据融合。

Result: 在8个合成及真实数据集上，EventTSF表现出色，相较于12个基线方法在预测精度上提升10.7%，训练速度提高约1.13倍。

Conclusion: EventTSF框架能有效处理由文本事件引起的不确定性，成为应对事件驱动的非平稳时间序列预测任务的有力工具。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

*Jiayu Fang,Zhiqi Shao,S T Boris Choy,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer提出一种结合SVD与Transformer的新框架，以改进定向图的表征学习，实现方向语义与全局结构的共同建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定向图神经网络在建模方向语义与全局结构上存在不足，主要归因于其均质聚合机制和局部过滤机制的限制。

Method: 提出SVDformer框架，通过多头自注意力改进奇异值嵌入，滤除高频噪声；利用Transformer对奇异值和奇异向量建模，实现具有方向性的特征传播，并引入可学习的低通/高通图过滤。

Result: 在六个有向图基准上进行广泛实验，SVDformer在节点分类任务上均优于现有最先进方法和方向感知的基线。

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图的表征学习确立了新范式，在方向语义和全局结构建模方面取得显著提升。

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ASAP的动态学习率调整方法，用于无标签的模型自适应，在多个数据集和场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实世界中在线标签分布变化中的学习率调整问题，提高模型适应能力。

Method: 通过计算当前和之前未标记输出之间的余弦距离，动态调整学习率，并将其限制在一个范围内，无需使用标签、模型集成或以往输入数据。

Result: 在多个数据集和标签分布变化场景中进行实验，ASAP方法在准确性和效率方面均取得一致提高。

Conclusion: ASAP是一种实用的无监督模型自适应方法，能够轻量级快速适应标签分布的变化。

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决层级多标签分类（HMC）中结构一致性的挑战以及多任务学习中损失加权不平衡问题，研究团队研发了一种创新的分类方法。

Method: 通过引入原型对比学习、动态权重分配、自适应任务加权机制，以及原型扰动机制扩展决策边界，同时还设计了层次违规率（HVR）这一新的定量评估指标。

Conclusion: 新提出的HCAL分类器可以保持语义一致性、高效优化，并提升鲁棒性，在层级多标签分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

Conclusion: DyMixOp框架通过有效处理非线性和对流特征，显著提升了偏微分方程建模的准确性，并具备良好的物理解释性和实用性。

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: 不确定性管通过高效的计算与直观的表示方式，为神经网络中不确定性量化和可视化提供了实用工具，提升了模型在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

Method: 在章节的第一部分，分析两种算法不透明性（技术性和故意隐藏的不透明性）；在第二部分，评估计算机科学中解决技术不透明性问题的解释方法。

Conclusion: XAI的发展虽然有助于解决AI系统的技术性不透明，但当前仍无法完全应对两种类型的不透明涉及的伦理和技术问题。

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电网中可再生能源比例的增加，需要调动建筑集群的灵活性来保持系统平衡。现有的测试平台通常仅限于单一建筑，或采用简化模型，无法充分体现物理复杂性。本文旨在开发一种新的测试平台来弥补这些不足。

Method: 研究开发了MuFlex平台，该平台支持通过EnergyPlus进行同步信息交换，遵循OpenAI Gym的接口，提供模块化和标准化的强化学习实现。使用Soft Actor-Critic算法在四个办公建筑中进行了控制策略案例研究。

Result: 案例研究显示，通过MuFlex协调的四座办公楼表现出需求灵活性的聚合作用，在达到设定门槛的同时减少总峰值需求，并保持了室内环境质量。

Conclusion: MuFlex证明了其在多建筑灵活性协调中的适用性和优势，特别是在强化学习控制策略的测试与基准评估中具备明显的潜力。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Motivation: 现有的MRSA预测模型缺乏流行病学可解释性，且精度有限，需要一种能结合多数据源并具备高效预测能力的新方法。

Method: 提出了CALYPSO框架，将神经网络与机械元胞模型结合，利用患者级别数据、通勤模式和医疗转移模式进行区域和时间特定参数学习。

Result: CALYPSO比传统机器学习基线在州级预测性能上提高超过4.5%，并能识别高风险区域以及最优资源分配策略。

Conclusion: CALYPSO不仅显著提高了预测精度和公共卫生干预策略的可操作性，还为未来流行病建模工具开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于常见遗传变异的风险预测精度不高，需要一种结合常见和罕见遗传变异的综合预测策略。

Method: 提出了CROC方法，一种基于FROC方法扩展的新方法，并对其处理罕见变异的能力进行评估。

Result: 使用GAW17迷你外显子数据集的533个SNP进行了评估，表明CROC方法在常见变异减少的情况下预测精度更高。

Conclusion: CROC方法相比传统FROC方法可以更有效地处理数据中的罕见变异，从而提高了疾病风险预测的准确性。

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Conclusion: GenHAI为医院管理者应对MRSA感染风险提供了一种有效的新方式，可回答多种相关问题。

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Result: 实验和理论分析结果表明，ADC在优化特征空间类信息保持能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADC方法为SSCL框架带来改进，使得特征空间能够更好地反映输入数据的类信息，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

### [197] [Bounding Causal Effects and Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13607)
*Tobias Maringgele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了现有局部识别方法的局限性与挑战，通过对多种界限算法进行评估并提出改进，引入开源Python工具以支持因果推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推断方法常依赖严格假设（如无未测量混杂或完全遵从），但这些假设在实际中很难被满足，因此需要开发替代方法来处理这种不确定性。

Method: 系统比较多种局部识别界限算法，包括符号方法、基于优化的方法以及信息论方法，并提出对近期引入的熵界方法的扩展，创建统一的评价框架和决策支持工具。

Result: 对随机生成和模拟的离散与连续数据进行广泛评估，分析了方法在界限紧致性、计算效率以及面对假设违反时的鲁棒性表现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了统一的比较与选择方法的框架，还开发了开源工具CausalBoundingEngine，为实践者推断因果关系提供了系统化支持。

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

*Wenxuan Ye,Xueli An,Onur Ayan,Junfan Wang,Xueqiang Yan,Georg Carle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FedOL方法，通过单次通信轮次内部署一个更大且更全面的服务器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动网络环境中，因隐私保护和资源异质性等问题，现有联邦学习方法在模型架构一致性及通信轮次需求上存在局限。

Method: FedOL采用知识蒸馏，客户端仅在未标注的公共数据集上交换模型预测输出，并引入特定目标函数以迭代优化伪标签与服务器模型。

Result: 实验证明，FedOL明显优于现有基线方法，并降低了通信开销。

Conclusion: FedOL为移动网络中的资源受限客户端提供了一种高效、隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

TL;DR: T2W 是一个扩散变换器框架，通过自然语言描述生成特定任务的神经网络权重，在实验中表现优于基于优化的初始化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络权重生成方法难以在实际应用中实现对未见任务的泛化，需要开发更通用和实用的生成方法。

Method: 提出了 T2W 框架，该框架通过层次处理网络参数、CLIP 文本嵌入、对抗性训练等方式生成更具泛化性的权重。

Result: 在 Cifar100、Caltech256 和 TinyImageNet 等数据集上，T2W 在未见任务上表现效果优良，并支持权重增强和文本引导模型融合等新应用。

Conclusion: T2W 将文本语义与权重动态结合，为神经网络参数生成的实际应用提供了新的可能性，推动了生成模型的实用性。

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调整方法复杂，需手动调节额外参数，在计算上耗费巨大，研究动机是寻找更直观且无需额外参数调节的自动化学习率更新方法。

Method: 通过利用随机的二阶算法理论，提出以随机梯度的内在变化为依据的学习率调整机制，即当随机梯度的范数减小时增大学习率，反之亦然。

Result: 提出的学习率调整机制在SGD、SGDM、SIGNSGD等经典随机算法下表现出效率、鲁棒性及扩展性。

Conclusion: 该学习率调整机制具有解释性、实现简单并且无需额外参数调节，在机器学习任务中表现优越。

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

### [201] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为输入时缩放的新扩展范式，通过在查询过程中优化资源分配来补充现有的大语言模型扩展方法。实验表明低质量数据集也能得到高性能，揭示出“小数据高质量”并非适用所有情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探索和提出新的扩展范式，即输入时缩放（Input Time Scaling），通过优化输入和元知识融合，提高训练和测试阶段的性能。

Method: 结合输入时元知识优化策略，在训练与测试中使用特定查询策略，并进行不同数据策略的对比实验，如低质量数据集使用和数据排序策略等。

Result: 通过在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型的实验，取得了AIME24和AIME25任务上的SOTA表现。同时发现低质量、少样本数据也能诱导高级推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的输入时缩放达成良好效果，且打破了传统“垃圾进垃圾出”的认知；更小、更灵活的数据集可能更适用于特定任务，进一步探索更具通用价值。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

TL;DR: 提出了FedSheafHN，一种处理个性化子图联邦学习的框架，通过纤维协作机制和超网生成个性化模型，在多种图数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于子图联邦学习中各客户端的局部子图数据分布存在异质性，性能差异成为关键问题，需要开发个性化模型来应对。

Method: 利用纤维扩散机制将客户端的局部子图嵌入到服务端构建的协作图中，通过超网优化生成客户端个性化模型。

Result: 实验表明，FedSheafHN在多种图数据集上优于现有方法，收敛速度快，并能有效推广到新客户端。

Conclusion: FedSheafHN在解决个性化子图联邦学习中的异质性问题和性能差异方面取得了显著效果，具有较好的应用前景。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

TL;DR: GRAFT是一种高效的训练中子集选择方法，通过在低秩特征空间中选择代表性子集，减少训练时间和环境影响，同时保持或提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练神经网络需要大量算力和资源，会带来高成本和环境影响，迫切需要高效的训练方法。

Method: GRAFT通过三个步骤实现：提取每批数据的低秩特征表示，使用Fast MaxVol寻找占据主导子空间的小多样子集，动态调整子集大小以满足梯度近似标准。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，GRAFT显示出比现有方法更高的准确性和效率，同时降低耗时、能耗和碳排放。

Conclusion: GRAFT提供了一种在准确性、效率和环境影响之间的理想平衡，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Result: 在一个新任务及两个标准基准任务上的实验结果证明了PS-PFN相较其他bandit方法和AutoML策略具有显著优势。

Conclusion: PS-PFN为现代机器学习流水线提出了一种高效、适应性强的AutoML扩展方法，提供了对复杂模型选择问题的高效解决方案。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注于随机性重尾分布Linear Bandit问题，对对抗性情形研究较少，因此提出解决对抗性重尾Bandit问题的需求。

Method: 采用FTRL算法，通过引入奖励函数偏移损失估计，结合HT-SPM数据依赖学习率以及方差减小的线性损失估计器，设计了适应双种情形的算法。

Result: 算法在对抗性设置下达到$\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$的最坏情况遗憾，随机性设置下取得$\widetilde{O}(\log T)$的差距依赖遗憾，扩展到线性Bandit场景也有类似的最优结果。

Conclusion: 提出的算法统一了对抗性和随机性重尾分布Bandit问题，为解决此类问题提供了新的理论方法和实践意义。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有维度降方法无法同时很好地表示数据的局部和全局结构，因此有必要开发新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过引入正则化项，将$t$-SNE的局部结构保留能力与PCA的全局结构表示能力相结合，生成一系列嵌入以平衡两者。

Result: 在七个真实数据集上进行测试，包括五个单细胞转录组学数据集和一个人口遗传学数据集，实验展示了DREAMS在多尺度结构保留上的优越性。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法在局部和全局结构保留方面实现了良好的平衡，优于现有方法，可广泛用于高维数据降维可视化。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: SRTS算法在优化Sharpe比率任务中具有理论上高效且实际中优越的表现，实验验证优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 增强深度和广度的两个维度以改善强化学习的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR面临深度（模型可处理的最难问题）和广度（单次迭代样本数量）不足的问题。

Method: 提出DARS方法，重新加权难问题以增加其阳性样本，并结合更大的批次训练以改进模型性能。

Result: DARS和DARS-B方法提升了Pass@K与Pass@1指标，证明深度与广度能独立且协同地提升推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过优化深度和广度，RLVR可以实现其潜在的强大推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PENGUIN模型，通过周期嵌套组注意力机制解决长期时间序列预测问题，表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在预测领域取得了突破，但其在时间序列预测中的效果尚存争议，作者希望通过显式建模周期性模式来改进模型效果。

Method: 提出了周期性嵌套的相对注意偏置来直接捕捉时间序列中的周期结构，同时通过分组注意机制处理多种共存的周期性问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，PENGUIN模型在多个基准数据集上均显著优于MLP及Transformer模型。

Conclusion: PENGUIN模型充分利用了周期性结构和分组注意机制，为时间序列预测提供了一种新的高效方法。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习中通信效率是个瓶颈问题，但如何选择训练回合中的客户数量研究较少。

Method: 提出了ISP，一种动态确定每轮优化客户端数量的自适应机制，以提高通信效率。

Result: 在视觉变换器、ECG分类及梯度压缩等任务中，ISP实现了约30%的通信节省，同时未降低模型质量。

Conclusion: ISP展现了其作为独立优化任务的潜力，为进一步提升联邦学习效率提供了新视角。

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于Subjective Logic的新框架，用于评估AI训练数据集的可信度，并能够在对全局属性（如偏见）进行不确定性评估时提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来AI系统愈发依赖训练数据，而数据集层面的特性（如公平性和偏见）的可信度评估变得至关重要。然而，之前的研究仅局限于评估单一数据的可信性。

Method: 本文使用Subjective Logic构建一个正式框架，通过不确定性感知的方式评估数据集层面的全局特性，如偏见，同时支持在证据不完全、分布式或冲突的情况下量化不确定性。

Result: 实验基于一个交通标志识别数据集，证明所提出的方法可以有效捕获类别不平衡现象，并在中心化和联邦化环境下保持可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个评估AI训练数据集可信性的新方法，为全局属性（如偏见）的不确定性评估提供了一个可靠工具。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Result: 通过与竞争方法在IR基准数据集上的数值比较证明了该方法的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了不平衡分布回归问题，并提升了预测建模的性能。

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Conclusion: 为从业者提供了根据不同目标和约束选择剪枝策略的新见解，同时给出一个新的混合策略。

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FedUP，一种轻量级的联邦消除算法，旨在通过剪枝攻击模型中特定的连接，高效地减轻恶意客户端的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受恶意模型中毒攻击的威胁，在其中敌人可能发送恶意的本地权重，企图破坏全局模型。联邦消除被提出作为一种解决方案，通过去除恶意贡献者的影响，而无需完全重新训练全局模型。

Method: FedUP算法通过分析恶意和良性客户端权重更新的最大差异以识别并停用特定连接。它利用最后一轮训练的客户端权重信息以高效保存良性信息，阻止恶意影响。

Result: 实验表明，FedUP在高威胁环境下表现出色（例如最多50%-1客户端为恶意），在IID和非IID数据下能有效减轻恶意影响，并显著降低恶意数据的准确性，同时保持良性数据的性能不变。

Conclusion: FedUP在效率、鲁棒性和存储需求方面都优于现有的方法，是一种高效的联邦消除解决方案，适用于高威胁对抗环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Motivation: 现行的生物识别评估框架已无法满足快速发展的技术需求，需引入新的评估方法以反映技术进步和新兴漏洞。

Method: 通过对24名生物识别专家的调查，评估不同生物识别模态的属性，同时分析55个数据集不确定性数据，结合实证与专家意见。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法 Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP)，以解决大批量训练时现有优化器的不足，改进了泛化性能并加速了收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当批量大小增大时，由于梯度噪声的减少，一阶优化方法难以跳出次优解，而二阶方法如KFAC需要过高阻尼保持稳定，导致性能下降。提出FOP以改善此问题。

Method: FOP通过整合来自两个子批次的梯度，生成一种基于 Fisher-metric 的正交方向的方差感知更新方向，以提高二阶方法的性能。

Result: FOP 恢复了二阶方法在大批量训练中的有效性，支持其在更大的批量下进行更高效的训练。

Conclusion: FOP 提供了一个可扩展的训练方法，在大批量情况下改进了二阶优化算法的泛化能力和收敛速度。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL)的新方法，通过改革Diffusion Q-Learning(DQL)以实现更高效的动作生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQL在动作生成时需要多步去噪，这不仅降低了效率，还限制了其实用性。研究的动机是实现更高效的离线强化学习方法。

Method: 通过使用一种名为Sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM)的方法，OFQL学习了平均速度场，能够在训练和推理中高效地通过一步生成动作。

Result: 实验表明，OFQL在D4RL基准测试中性能优于DQL和其他基于扩散的方法，同时显著减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: OFQL克服了DQL多步采样和递归梯度更新的局限性，使训练和推理更加快速和健壮，为离线强化学习提供了有效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Conclusion: 实验表明Transformer适用于高精度预测，LSTM适合超低能耗场景，这种本地化、能效高的预测方法能显著提高下水道系统的韧性。

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

Result: 在DeepMind控制套件的实验中，与传统政策相比，该方法能够更快收敛并表现优越。

Conclusion: Latent分类分布为连续控制中的结构化探索和多模态行为表示提供了强大工具，具备良好的适应性和性能。

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Motivation: 自动特征工程旨在减少人工特征工程的高昂时间和经济成本，但其对实际应用场景的可用性仍未充分研究。

Method: 对53种自动特征工程方法进行了调查，评估其实用性、文档情况以及用户社区支持等方面。

Result: 调查发现，这些方法普遍存在难以使用、缺乏文档支持、缺乏活跃社区和无法设置时间与内存约束的问题。

Conclusion: 未来的研究应着眼于开发更易用、工程良好的自动特征工程方法，以满足用户需求。

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

TL;DR: 研究表明，使用精挑细选的固定任务权重的线性标量化可以与复杂的多任务优化方法媲美甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进一步理解为什么某些权重会带来最佳性能，以及如何在不进行耗时的超参数搜索情况下选择这些权重。

Method: 本文提出了AutoScale框架，通过衡量任务优化的关键指标（如梯度大小相似性）来指导线性标量化的权重选择。

Result: AutoScale在多个数据集（包括一个新的大规模基准）上展现了卓越的性能和高效性。

Conclusion: AutoScale框架无需进行繁琐的搜索，便能稳定高效地提升多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

### [227] [Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandits for Personalized Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13981)
*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit（多用户情境级联博弈）的新框架，通过并行上下文会话、级联反馈和异质奖励模型解决多用户同时交互场景问题，并设计了两种算法（UCBBP和AUCBBP）实现高效和低遗憾界的在线广告投放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多在线广告场景涉及多个用户和逐步展示的物品交互，现有模型难以有效建模多用户交互、上下文探索及级联反馈的实际情况。

Method: 提出包含级联反馈、并行上下文会话以及异质奖励机制的多用户情境级联博弈（MCCB）模型，并设计了两个算法：UCBBP和AUCBBP。其中UCBBP是传统的UCB样式算法，AUCBBP针对多用户场景进行了效率改良。

Result: 理论上证明了UCBBP和AUCBBP的遗憾界分别为\$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})\$和\$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})\$，并通过数值实验验证了两种算法在各种设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: MCCB及其算法有效地应对了多用户情境中的在线广告投放问题，理论和实验结果均表明新方法在用户扩展和低遗憾界方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

TL;DR: 提出了Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR)框架，用于统一表示和研究深度学习中的模型效率技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏统一和模块化的框架来系统化地优化和比较模型效率技术。

Method: 通过将不同的效率方法抽象为可控的knob、确定性规则和可测量的meter，KMR框架提供了一种数学精确的方式进行效率优化。

Result: 提出了KMR三元组模板，可以用于描述现有的效率技术；提出了Budgeted-KMR算法，支持迭代预算优化；展示了不同方法之间的潜在关系。

Conclusion: KMR框架是一种概念性和实践性的工具，用于统一和推动模型效率研究，包括自动化策略学习动态适应和理论分析等领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible
policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the
Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

*Sergey Salishev,Ian Akhremchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的量化神经网络调优方法，通过将量化视为有约束的光滑优化问题来优化网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量化神经网络中，逐层量化的舍入操作会降低容量且随着位宽减少导致性能下降，因此需要有效的优化方法来识别和缓解量化瓶颈。

Method: 将微分的STE与可学习位宽、噪声尺度及边界结合，通过外部点惩罚实现目标位宽，并用蒸馏实现训练稳定性。

Result: 该方法即使在W1A1的极限配置下也能保持高效STE的同时达到竞争性的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的量化优化方法在性能和效率上实现了良好平衡，特别是在极低位宽配置下表现卓越。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的架构ASDFormer，用于捕捉与自闭症相关的大脑功能连接模式，并实现诊断和标志物发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明自闭症与大脑功能连接的改变密切相关，准确捕捉这些变化模式对改进诊断及发现生物标志物至关重要。

Method: 提出ASDFormer架构，结合Transformer和混合池化分类专家（MoE），通过多专家分支和注意机制适应性地强调与自闭症相关的大脑区域和连接模式。

Result: ASDFormer在ABIDE数据集上实现了目前最优的诊断准确性，同时揭示了与自闭症相关的大脑功能连接异常。

Conclusion: ASDFormer展现出诊断自闭症及发现功能连接标志物的潜力，为临床研究提供支持。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究主要集中于统计方法和代数拓扑方法。作者尝试通过一般拓扑的视角，研究数据集X的内部结构及其特性。

Method: 通过引入开集类型的概念，定义特殊类型集合及其相关拓扑结构，并分析数据集X中分量、轨道及相关的伪树结构。其创新点在于提出了一种类型-II伪树，用于表示跨轨道的分量间关系。

Result: 利用引入的拓扑结构，新算法平台得以构建，展示了在计算凸包、洞检测、聚类及异常检测等问题中的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文的方法提供了一种研究有限拓扑空间数据集的新视角，连接统计方法与拓扑概念，提示更多探索方向。

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法规如遗忘权增加了从模型中移除训练数据的需求，全重新训练成本高昂，需开发高效的图学习遗忘方法。

Method: 通过定义知识图谱影响函数，用泰勒展开估算数据移除引起的参数变化，使用费舍矩阵和零阶优化替代高计算成本的梯度和导数计算。

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法在遗忘效率和质量上显著优于其他图遗忘基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的KG遗忘解决方案，减少了计算开销，并在性能上表现优越。

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练框架BLIP，用于改善MLIPs在模拟化学中的表现，尤其是在数据稀缺或分布外情况下的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MLIPs在模拟化学中的数据匮乏或分布外场景下表现不好，并且缺乏内建的不确定性估计，这影响了模型的可靠性和在主动学习中的应用。

Method: 设计了一个基于变分贝叶斯的框架BLIP，它通过变分Dropout提供不确定性估计，可与现有的消息传递架构无缝整合，并支持对能量与力的高效预测。

Result: BLIP在各种任务中表现出更高的预测精度及可信的不确定性估计，特别是在数据稀缺或分布外数据场景中，其额外训练的计算开销最小化。

Conclusion: BLIP框架有效提升了MLIPs的性能和可靠性，并能通过微调机制为现有的MLIPs提供稳定的性能改进。

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

TL;DR: 本研究提出LEOPARD算法，通过结合偏好反馈和专家演示来高效学习多种领域的奖励函数，并显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在任务复杂的情况下难以制定良好的奖励函数，且当前结合偏好反馈和专家演示的方法往往缺乏通用性或可扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种新的学习框架“reward-rational partial orderings over observations”，并基于此开发了LEOPARD算法，能够从多种数据如负面演示中高效学习奖励函数。

Result: 在有限偏好和演示反馈的情况下，LEOPARD显著优于现有基线算法，并表明结合多种反馈类型往往优于单一类型。

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一种灵活、可扩展的方式，通过多种类型的反馈有效学习奖励函数，对强化学习任务有重要帮助。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多种可塑性机制的生物启发型SNN训练框架，显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SNN的学习机制单一，限制了其适应性和表征能力，因此希望通过结合多种学习机制以强化SNN。

Method: 设计了一种多重可塑性机制的SNN训练框架，各机制协同调节信息积累并独立更新动态。

Result: 通过静态图像和动态神经形态数据集的实验，证明该框架较传统方法在性能和鲁棒性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 为开发基于多策略脑启发学习的更强大的SNN奠定了通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for
low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but
identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the
presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN
training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which
limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple
synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method
enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation
of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively
independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and
dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism
models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing
more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

Motivation: 当前符号回归算法中，遗传编程经常重复访问并评估搜索空间中的相同点，浪费了计算资源。

Method: 采用Zobrist哈希机制实现缓存，避免重复计算，并在开源框架Operon中实现该方法。

Result: 在一系列真实世界回归问题中，该方法加速了多达34%的计算时间，且搜索质量没有受到负面影响。

Conclusion: 利用哈希机制提高符号回归中的效率，不仅减少了运行时间，还为基于缓存信息调整搜索策略提供了机遇。

Abstract: Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to
discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a
priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly
used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an
evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical
expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze
the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in
the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the
algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by
introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing
frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and
subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach
using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a
selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\%
speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing
approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while
also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy
based on cached information.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个不确定性感知学习政策，通过结合医生的背景知识和胸部X光病变信息，提升肺癌的早期诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI在诊断肺癌时，由于仅依赖于目标病变的重复学习，缺乏足够的背景知识，导致诊断不确定性，影响了医生对其的信任以及临床应用的普及。

Method: 研究提出一个不确定性感知学习政策，该政策通过学习医生的背景知识和胸部X光病变信息，解决现有医学AI知识不足的问题。实验使用来自Ajou大学医院的2,517张无病变影像和656张结节影像进行模型训练。

Result: 所提出的模型在IoU为0.2 / FPPI为2的条件下，敏感性提高了10%，并且不确定性（熵）减少了0.2，最终诊断性能达到92%。

Conclusion: 研究证明，引入医生背景知识能够有效减轻医学AI诊断中的不确定性问题，从而提升肺癌早期检测和干预的准确性与可信度。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.
