### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于经典结构化预测框架的训练目标，用于面部标志检测，达到了先进的性能，同时训练速度提升了2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部标志检测在计算机视觉中非常重要，但现有基于软argmax的热图回归方法存在局限性，因此探索替代方法，以实现更高效和准确的性能。

Method: 提出了一种替代训练目标，基于经典的结构化预测框架，而不依赖传统的Soft-argmax方法。

Result: 在三个面部标志基准（WFLW, COFW, 300W）上取得了优秀的性能，训练速度提升至2.2倍，同时保持了良好的或者有竞争力的精度。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax不是实现优越性能的唯一办法，所提出的方法在性能和效率上都具有突出的优势。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究结合图卷积网络（GCNs）与Voronoi图，提出一种新的图像分类方法，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图像分类效果，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度类别的挑战性问题中。

Method: 将图卷积网络与Voronoi图集成，通过Delaunay三角剖分优化图像的图形表示，改进分类模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了更高的处理效率和分类精度，优于现有模型，尤其在具有挑战性的场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究证明了结合GCNs与Voronoi图的方法能有效提升图像分类的性能，并扩展了图学习在计算机视觉中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种单阶段的方法YOPO，用于从单RGB图像中实现类别级别的9自由度（DoF）姿态估计，无需额外数据，并在多项基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段流程的问题，提出一种基于纯RGB图像的简单方法，以直接实现高性能类别级别的姿态估计。

Method: 设计了YOPO框架，结合transformer探测器、轻量化姿态头、基于边界框的平移模块以及6D-aware的匈牙利匹配损失，在仅使用RGB图像及类别级别姿态标签的情况下进行端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，YOPO 在${\rm{IoU}_{50}}$指标上达到79.6%，在$10^\circ 10{\rm{cm}}$指标上达到54.1%，超越其他RGB-only方法，并逼近RGB-D系统的性能。

Conclusion: YOPO 使用简约设计成功统一了物体检测与9-DoF姿态估计，证明在无需额外数据的情况下，RGB-only方法也可达到高性能。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的防伪检测方法，适用于物理和数字攻击，具备高效性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统易受物理和数字伪造攻击，需要一种统一的方法减少复杂性和延迟。

Method: 采用配对采样对比框架，通过匹配真实和攻击自拍对来学习与模态无关的生命迹象特征。

Result: 该方法在第六届人脸防伪挑战测试中取得2.10%的分类错误率，优于已有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法兼顾高效性和实用性，可应用于实际场景中，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/xPONYx/iccv2025_deepfake_challenge.

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种无需训练的新型黑盒快速对抗性图像生成方法TAIGen，利用扩散模型，只需3-20步生成高效对抗样本并保持图像质量，展现出对多种模型的卓越攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的生成模型通常需耗费大量计算资源且生成低质量图像，而扩散模型尽管质量高，但生成对抗样本需多步采样，效率较低，亟需一种快速高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新型TAIGen方法，通过仅在混合步间隔注入扰动实现高效对抗生成，并设计了选择性RGB策略，用注意力图作用于红通道，结合GradCAM引导的绿色和蓝色通道扰动，从而平衡图像结构保持与对分类模型的攻击效果。

Result: TAIGen实现了在ImageNet数据集上对ResNet、MNASNet和ShuffleNet分别为70.6%、80.8%和97.8%的攻击成功率；图像视觉质量在所有测试数据集中PSNR均保持在30 dB以上；生成速度比现有扩散模型攻击快10倍。

Conclusion: TAIGen方法以最低的鲁棒性精度体现了最强的攻击效果，显示现有防御机制难以纯化其生成的对抗图像，是一种高效且影响深远的对抗性攻击技术。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RUN++的可逆展开网络，用于解决隐蔽视觉感知中RGB域和掩模域的不确定性问题，并引入生成性精细化改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVP方法主要在掩模域上使用可逆策略，RGB域的潜力未被充分挖掘，需探索更有效的方法。

Method: 通过双域联合建模和多阶段深度网络展开，设计了RUN++，其中包括CORE模块、CARE模块和FINE模块，用于逐步优化不确定区域，并结合Bernoulli扩散模型进行精细化处理。

Result: RUN++显著减少了假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界下降解条件下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 提出的RUN++网络和双层优化框架为解决实际场景中的隐蔽视觉感知问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CurveFlow框架，通过引入曲率指导，解决现有线性轨迹限制问题，提升文本到图像生成的语义一致性与图像质量。代码已公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性轨迹方法可能导致生成过程经过数据流形的低概率区域，影响语义对齐效果。作者希望探索轨迹曲率如何与生成图像的语义一致性相关。

Method: 提出了CurveFlow框架，通过曲率正则化来优化非线性轨迹并引导流动路径，抑制轨迹动态的突然变化。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014与2017数据集上，CurveFlow表现优于标准线性与非线性基准模型，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE 和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 曲率敏感的建模能有效提升复杂指令的遵从性，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HiRQA的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过分层排名和质量对齐实现质量感知的嵌入，具有很强的泛化性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的无参考图像质量评估方法在数据集偏差和主观标签依赖方面存在问题，导致泛化性能受限。

Method: 作者提出HiRQA框架，结合排名和对比学习，利用输入图像进行质量评分，不依赖参考图像或辅助信息。引入高阶排名损失和嵌入距离损失，并通过对比对齐损失进一步优化表示学习。

Result: HiRQA训练于合成失真数据，但能有效泛化到真实降质条件（如镜头炫光、雾霾、运动模糊和低光等），并在多个基准上表现出SOTA性能。同时，轻量级版本HiRQA-S具备实时处理能力。

Conclusion: HiRQA展示了无参考图像质量评估在泛化能力、性能和实时性上的优越表现，验证了其作为先进解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，在具备时空相关扰动的情况下仍能维持可靠的多视角3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决紧急响应、战术场景及公共安全中的多视角3D重建问题，满足实时性及动态边缘环境需求。

Result: 通过公开及定制3D数据集验证所提策略在扰动情境下的优越性，优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态、易受扰的边缘环境下，能够有效保证多视角3D重建的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度学习模型在临床中缺乏透明性和可解释性，这给DR诊断的广泛应用带来了障碍，因此该研究提出了一种新的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: XDR-LVLM框架结合了一个专门的医学视觉编码器和LVLM核心，采用多任务提示工程和多阶段微调技术以理解眼底图像中的病理特征并生成诊断报告。报告包括DR严重程度分级、关键病理概念识别及解释。

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM在性能、解释能力与临床实用性上表现卓越，成功缩小了自动诊断与临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,Rüdiger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MeSS方法，用于生成高质量、风格一致的户外场景，解决城市网格模型缺乏真实纹理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的城市网格模型缺乏真实的纹理，限制了它们在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用场景。

Method: 通过改进图像扩散模型的视图一致性，提出了一个分三个阶段的管道，包括几何一致稀疏视图生成、密集视图传播以及视觉一致性消除。同时结合3D高斯散射技术重建场景。

Result: 所提方法在几何对齐和生成质量上优于现有方法。生成的场景可以通过重新照明和风格转移技术以多种风格渲染。

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了现实纹理生成问题，为城市网格模型的多领域应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型多使用基于规则的方法模拟环境中的周边代理行为，但规则驱动的代理在安全关键应用（如无人驾驶）中需要更加精准地建模，因此需要一种更能揭示缺陷的对抗性行为。

Method: 通过学习算法为规则驱动的代理设计对抗性行为，用以制造失败场景，并利用这种对抗性行为评估规则驱动代理的累积分数下降程度。

Result: 通过实验评估，对抗性代理能够成功降低规则驱动代理的累积奖励值。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用对抗性行为生成可以有效发现现有规则模型的潜在弱点，为安全关键领域的强化学习模型测试提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: 针对3D内容多模态特点，提出TriMM模型，通过多模态编码和三平面扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前3D生成模型单模态局限性和3D数据集利用不足的问题，充分利用多模态数据优势。

Method: 提出协作多模态编码与辅助监督机制，使用三平面潜变量扩散模型生成3D资产。

Result: TriMM在多个数据集上表现出色，超越大规模单模态模型，并验证其他多模态数据的扩展可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM实现了更高效的3D多模态生成，平衡多模态特性并增强了纹理与几何细节表现力。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了现有方法的缺陷，通过理论和实验验证了方法的有效性，提升了聚类任务的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 本文为基于语言和视觉的无人机导航提供了具有创新性的任务设定、框架及数据集，证明了高低空协同导航在复杂环境中的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳步采样机制，通过直接跳过多个中间去噪步骤加速扩散模型的生成过程，从而提升采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过在原始扩散模型的Markovian生成方式上提升采样效率，无需转向非Markovian扩散过程。

Method: 引入跳步采样机制，从相同的训练目标计算出直接跳过多个中间去噪步骤的采样方式，并与DDIM结合增强生成性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等预训练扩散模型上显著减少了采样步骤，同时生成质量保持较高水平。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的预训练本质上具有通过Markovian方式实现加速采样的潜力，跳步采样是提升采样效率的有效方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Conclusion: Comp-X为图像压缩开启了一个具有人工通用智能潜力的全新方向，为用户友好型智能编码铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue

Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在一对一分配监督策略上存在局限性，无法充分利用监督信息，影响了车道拓扑推理的效果。

Method: 通过重新设计Transformer解码器，引入可保持冗余预测的一对多分配策略，以及并行的独立跨注意力块，从而增强车道检测的数量和几何多样性。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了RATopo策略能够与现有的拓扑推理框架无缝集成并显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RATopo策略具有模型无关性，能够增强车道间及车道与交通元素的拓扑关系推理，为自动驾驶车道拓扑建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种创新方法Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA)，用于通过超声视频进行胎儿先天性心脏缺陷（CHD）的分类。与现有方法相比，TPA通过集成时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化来提升检测性能与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CHD检测受限于图像噪声、探头位置变化等问题，现有机器学习方法忽视时序信息，仅限于二分类，缺乏预测校准，亟需一种更加全面且可靠的解决方案。

Method: TPA利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取帧特征，并用可训练的时序提取器聚合获取运动信息；同时通过边距-铰链对比损失与特定类别文本提示对齐。另外，引入CVAESM模块以学习潜在风格向量，增强嵌入调制，实现不确定性量化。

Result: 在私有CHD检测数据集上宏F1分数达到85.40%，期望校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%。在EchoNet-Dynamic的三分类任务上，宏F1分数从53.89%提升至58.62%，提高了4.73%。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，实现了胎儿CHD分类的性能和可靠性提升，为临床检测提供了更高精度和可信度的方法。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的伪装目标检测方法需要大量计算资源和高质量手动提示生成，且无法高效应对COD任务。

Method: 提出RAG-SEG方法，将COD任务分为两个阶段：1. 使用无监督聚类建立检索数据库并通过检索生成粗略的伪标签；2. 利用SAM模型以伪标签为提示精确生成目标掩码。整个流程无需传统的模型训练。

Result: 在基准测试数据集上，RAG-SEG方法的性能与最先进方法相当或更优，并且可以在普通个人笔记本电脑上高效运行。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG方法证明了一种无需培训的伪装目标检测新范式，具有高性能和计算效率，且潜力强大。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Motivation: T2V扩散模型可能因生成有害或错误信息而引发隐私、版权和安全问题，因此需要一种能过滤不良内容的解决方案。

Method: 使用视频Eraser，一个包含两阶段过程（选择性提示嵌入调整SPEA和抗对抗噪声引导ARNG）的插件模块，可无缝集成到代表性T2V模型中。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在无需重新训练的情况下，能够有效抑制T2V生成中的不良内容，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 本研究通过使用注意力淘汰分析工具，对视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）进行系统的实证研究，揭示了其内部处理机制，并提出了提高计算效率的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有研究集中于提高视频大语言模型的性能，而对其内部机制缺乏理解。因此，作者希望通过研究揭示这些模型如何处理视频内容。

Method: 作者设计了三种注意力淘汰方法：视频时间淘汰、视频空间淘汰、语言到视频淘汰，并在不同层窗口应用这些方法，还设计了全局和细化两种研究设置。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 早期层主要提取视频信息，形成两阶段处理——低层专注于感知编码，高层聚焦于抽象推理；(2) 某些中间层在回答视频问题中起关键作用，大部分其他层贡献较少；(3) 时空建模更多依赖于语言引导的检索，而非视频帧间的自注意机制，尽管后者计算成本较高。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示视频大语言模型内部处理视频内容方式的研究，为后续研究提供了可解释性和效率视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过选择性微调模型中的部分层，优化迁移学习的效率，减少模型过拟合和计算成本问题。

Method: 引入BioTune技术，该技术使用进化算法识别需要微调的关键层，从而优化目标任务下的模型表现。

Result: 对不同领域的九个图像分类数据集进行评估，显示BioTune在准确性和效率上优于或持平于现有的微调方法，如AutoRGN和LoRA。

Conclusion: 通过选择性微调与相关任务最匹配的模型层，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，提升了迁移学习的效能，适用于多样化的数据分布场景。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法未能有效处理大型场景存储需求以及存档后场景的可变性问题。

Method: 通过联合利用高斯点和其属性间的相关性，并使用固定的共享码书进行场景编码，结合图像条件解码技巧，实现高效压缩和适应性。

Result: 实验数据显示，ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和适应场景变化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提高了3DGS数据的压缩效率，并能有效应对存档后的场景变化，其开源代码将公开。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Method: 提出DriveSplat方法，采用基于动态-静态解耦的神经高斯表示，通过区域划分的体素初始化增强细节表现；引入可变形高斯模型，并结合可学习的形变网络调整动态元素；利用深度与法线先验对几何结构进行监督。

Conclusion: DriveSplat成功解决了动态-静态场景解耦问题，提高了几何准确性和新视角渲染的鲁棒性，适用于复杂驾驶场景的高质量3D重建。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨当前深度学习算法在抽象推理能力上的不足，并尝试通过解决Raven矩阵问题，提升机器智能的此项核心能力。

Method: 采用“因果链建模”视角分析抽象推理问题，设计DIO基线模型。通过实验发现其优化目标的不足，并逐步提出三种改进方法以解决模型在逻辑推理中的缺陷。

Result: 实验表明，原优化目标未能有效捕捉抽象推理所需的因果关系，但借助改进方法，模型在特定任务上表现有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过因果链分析深入理解抽象推理问题，论文揭示了现有优化目标的限制，并提出具针对性的改进方法，为提高深度学习模型抽象推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Conclusion: SpiVG通过创新的网络设计和优化技术提升了视频摘要的表现，显著减少计算复杂度，并增强了信息密度，可为相关研究提供重要参考。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: 尽管MAEs在视觉基础模型预训练中表现出色，但当应用于新数据集时，超参数的调整是一个关键挑战，因此需要研究其超参数与下游任务性能之间的关系。

Method: 通过理论推导，分析线性和非线性的MAEs在学习图像的空间相关性时的表现，主要聚焦于masking ratio与patch size对学习短距离和长距离空间相关性的影响。

Result: 得出MAE表示不仅适配了数据集中的空间相关性，还超越了二阶统计特性。并根据分析提出了实践中选择MAE超参数的建议。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过合理选择MAE的掩码比例和patch大小等超参数，可以更好地捕获输入图像的空间相关性，从而提升其在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Motivation: 现有多帧方法仅利用滑动窗口内的相邻帧信息，忽略了全局时间信息和整体视频优化，从而导致计算冗余和性能不足。

Method: 提出了BIRD方法，通过双向时间信息传播策略分别使用局部和全局时间信息。具体包括设计局部时间运动融合（LTMF）模块和全局时间运动融合（GTMF）模块，并结合检测损失和额外的时空融合损失共同优化视频剪辑。

Conclusion: BIRD方法优化了现有方法的不足，通过全面利用时间信息和联合优化视频剪辑，有效提升了移动红外小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Motivation: 对于广泛使用的人脸检测应用，低分辨率条件对检测性能有显著影响，因此需要深入分析分辨率对主流检测模型准确性和鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 采用WIDER FACE数据集，设置三种不同分辨率（160x160、320x320、640x640），评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN在人脸检测中的表现，采用精度、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95及推断时间等指标衡量性能。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: MATR有效解决了Vid2VidMR任务中的相关挑战，显著优于现有方法，并在新数据集上验证了其一般化性能。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需SfM的3D Gaussian Splatting方法，用于从极端稀疏的视图输入中联合估计相机姿态并重建3D场景，用实验显示比现有技术更优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的3DGS方法依赖稠密多视角输入和精确的相机姿态，而这些条件在现实场景中难以满足，无法在稀疏视图条件下提供高质量渲染。

Method: 提出一种无需SfM的稠密立体模块初始3D结构重建，并设计了视点插值模块生成一致性内容以及多尺度几何正则化方法以优化渲染质量。

Result: 在极端稀疏视图下(仅2视图)，PSNR提升了2.75dB，合成图像失真较小且保存了丰富的高频细节。

Conclusion: 新方法在极端稀疏视图场景中的性能显著提升，可以生成视觉质量优越的图像，展现了其先进性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: 研究提出LGMSNet，一种基于局部与全局双重多尺度的轻量级医学影像分割框架，在多个数据集上实现了卓越性能和良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在资源有限的临床场景下提供高效、通用的医学影像分割模型，解决现有模型效率与性能权衡、全局上下文感知能力不足以及通道冗余问题。

Method: 引入局部与全局双重多尺度设计，通过异质的层内内核提取高频信息并减少通道冗余，同时结合稀疏的Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频的全局信息。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上表现优异，并在四个未见数据集上的零样本测试中展现了出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LGMSNet不仅实现了最先进的性能，还展现出其在资源有限的临床场景中的部署潜力，是医学影像分割领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

TL;DR: MExECON是一种从稀疏多视图RGB图像生成穿衣人类3D模型的新方法，通过结合多视图信息改进几何和姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服单视图3D重建方法的局限性，提升衣着人类3D模型的几何现实性和姿态准确性。

Method: 提出了JMBO算法，在所有输入视图中联合拟合单个SMPL-X人体模型，从而在低频特征基础上通过法线图集成捕获细节。

Result: 实验表明，MExECON比单视图方法在保真度上显著提升，并在与现代稀少视图3D重建方法的比较中表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MExECON无需额外训练网络便可有效结合多视图信息，改进3D模型的细节和准确性。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为AdaSFFuse的新框架，旨在通过自适应跨域协同融合学习实现多模态图像融合（MMIF）的任务泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模式失配、高频细节破坏和任务特定局限性等挑战。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT)用于频率分离，以及Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks用于高效多模态融合，从而优化跨域融合。

Result: 该方法在红外-可见光图像融合、全聚焦图像融合、多曝光图像融合和医学图像融合四项任务中表现出优越性能，兼顾低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse显著改善了多模态特征的对齐与整合，减少了频率损失并保留了关键细节，是一种在性能和效率之间取得良好平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中的几何一致性差和生成效果过于平滑的问题，改进生成驾驶场景外推视图的真实性与一致性。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，结合Road Surface Gaussian (RSG)和Far Field Gaussians (FFG) 表示法，使用自监督的不确定性估计框架选择性整合生成先验。

Result: 实验证明，ExtraGS在多个数据集、多摄像头设置和各种生成先验下显著提升了外推视图的真实性与几何一致性，同时保持较高的原始轨迹细节。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何与生成先验，有效克服外推渲染的局限，增强自动驾驶驾驶场景模拟的表现。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法GroupSketch，用于多对象交互和复杂运动的矢量素描动画，克服了现有方法的局限性，生成高质量和时间一致性的动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量素描动画方法在多对象交互和复杂运动场景中表现不佳，存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段将输入素描分为语义组并定义关键帧，生成初步动画；第二阶段通过Group-based Displacement Network (GDN)微调动画，结合文本到视频模型的先验并引入新的模块，提升动画质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，能够在复杂多对象草图动画上生成高质量、时间一致的结果。

Conclusion: GroupSketch拓展了素描动画的实际应用，为处理复杂多对象场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感图像中窄路提取困难问题，如宽度受限、拓扑碎片化和遮挡频繁等挑战。

Method: 提出D3FNet网络，包括差分注意力扩张提取模块、双流解码融合机制及多尺度扩张策略，从而提升窄路段的分割精度与连续性。

Result: D3FNet在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG数据集上取得了优于主流方法的IoU和召回表现，特别是在具有挑战性的路段区域。

Conclusion: D3FNet有效提升了复杂遥感场景下窄路提取的精度和鲁棒性，展现了其作为解决此类问题的潜力。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种先进的分布感知和无反向传播的测试时自适应方法（ADAPT），无需依赖源数据、梯度更新或完整的目标数据访问，解决了测试时自适应中计算复杂度和分布建模的挑战，实现了多种分布偏移场景下的领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法在处理分布偏移问题中依赖后向传播或迭代优化，难以实时应用，并且缺乏对于类别条件特征分布的建模能力，导致边界不可靠与预测不够精确。

Method: 提出ADAPT方法，将测试时自适应重塑为高斯概率推断任务，通过逐步更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵对类别条件概率进行建模，并且引入由CLIP先验和历史知识库指导的轻量级正则化机制，以校正可能的偏差，实现了无需训练的推断。

Result: 实验表明，ADAPT方法在各种基准测试中表现出色，在分布偏移环境下具备更好的扩展性与稳健性。

Conclusion: ADAPT拓展了测试时自适应的应用边界，实现了在不依赖源数据、不需要梯度更新情况下的实时处理，提供了一种新型、可扩展性高的分布感知解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过邻域感知软掩码，在图像隐式神经表示（INR）中解决神经网络的频谱偏置问题，提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像隐式神经表示（INR）面临频谱偏置问题，网络更倾向于低频分量，导致高频细节如边缘和纹理的捕获能力不足，需改进训练方法以解决此问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，利用邻域感知软掩码，初期为局部变化大的像素赋予更高权重，集中训练高频细节，随后过渡到全图训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法能一致改善重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知的重要性，为减轻频谱偏置提供了新途径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 现有方法在点云配准的全局优化上效率低下，作者旨在开发更快的全局优化方法。

Method: 提出线性时间的凸松弛方法和改进的分支定界（BnB）算法加速器。

Result: 新方法在旋转轴已知情况下实现了不到半秒的全局优化，比现有方法快两数量级。

Conclusion: 方法在某些特定情况下非常高效，尽管目前尚无法解决全6自由度问题，但具有良好的发展潜力。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

Motivation: 现有的视频大语言模型在时间感知方面存在短板，如时间戳编码不明确、视觉特征连续性较弱以及语言与视觉对齐问题。该研究旨在解决这些问题，从而提高模型在理解视频中事件发生时间及实体交互的能力。

Method: 通过三项创新：1) 提出一种Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) 编码器以提升事件边界敏感性并保持时间一致性；2) 引入对象锚定表示以加强对查询实体的对齐能力；3) 采用混合令牌方案对时间戳进行显式建模，从而实现细粒度的时间推理。

Conclusion: 通过改进时间感知与语言视觉对齐能力，Grounded VideoDiT展示了强大的视频理解和推理能力，有助于推进视频大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Motivation: ALS数据用于森林监测，但因数据质量和标注成本高，树实例分割具有挑战性。

Method: 采用弱监督方法，通过初始分割结果的质量评分训练评估模型，然后用评估反馈微调分割模型。

Result: 改进后的模型树实例正确识别率提高了34%，但在稀疏林地区和复杂地形中仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 弱监督分割方法有效减少了数据标注依赖并提升了分割表现，但在特定环境下仍需改进。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Motivation: 当前三维对抗攻击方法需要依赖目标模型的信息，但绝对安全条件下获取此信息较难，因此需要研究在无需任何目标模型信息的情况下实现对抗攻击的方法。

Method: 通过引入Critical Feature Guidance (CFG)，借助对提取特征的重要性进行计算，优先破坏各架构共同的关键特征，同时约束对抗点云的最大偏离程度以保证不可察觉性。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN数据集上的实验表明，所提出的CFG方法在攻击表现上大幅超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: CFG方法在无需目标模型信息情况下成功实现了高效的三维点云对抗攻击，具有显著的转移性和不可察觉性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MapKD的知识蒸馏框架，通过教师-教练-学生(TCS)范式，实现多模态模型的知识向单一视觉模型的高效转移。通过两种蒸馏策略，显著提升了学生模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线高精地图构建中依赖过时离线地图和多模态传感器带来的计算复杂性问题，开发低成本且高效的视觉中心模型。

Method: 提出MapKD框架，采用教师-教练-学生(TCS)范式，并设计出Token引导的2D Patch蒸馏(TGPD)和带掩码的语义响应蒸馏(MSRD)两种蒸馏策略，实现知识转移和语义学习指导。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，MapKD使学生模型的mIoU提升6.68，mAP提升10.94，同时显著加速了推理速度。

Conclusion: MapKD框架有效解决了在线HD地图构建的高成本问题，在性能和速度上取得了显著提升，为自动驾驶地图构建提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CM2LoD3的新方法，通过冲突图（CMs）的语义分割，改进LoD3建筑模型的重建，显著提高了重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏细节，对LoD3模型的需求日益增加。然而，LoD3模型生成通常依赖手动操作，难以大规模实现。

Method: 利用射线与模型先验分析生成冲突图，结合语义冲突图生成器（SCMG），对真实冲突图进行语义分割。还融合了带有置信分数的纹理模型细节以提高精度。

Result: 实验结果表明，CM2LoD3方法在建筑开口分割和重建表现优异，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合法实现61%的性能表现。

Conclusion: 此研究显著推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的发展，为大规模和高效的3D城市建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MDPR的框架，通过多维动态提示路由解决预训练视觉-语言模型在类不均衡场景下的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型在微调阶段容易受到类不均衡数据集的影响导致偏差积累，同时现有方法忽视了模型预训练阶段的类不均衡问题。

Method: 提出MDPR框架，构建包含五个视觉-语义维度的知识库，在微调阶段通过动态路由机制对全局视觉类别对齐、检索最优提示，并通过logits融合平衡细粒度语义。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾数据集中，MDPR达到了当前SOTA方法的相当表现，同时消融实验验证了其语义库在尾类上的有效性，且动态路由机制计算开销极小。

Conclusion: MDPR是一种高效灵活的增强框架，可有效改善数据不均衡场景下视觉-语言模型的微调性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StreamMem的新机制，用于高效处理长视频下的流媒体多模态任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在视觉-语言推理上取得了进展，但在处理长视频时受到内存和计算限制的影响，难以应用于长视频理解和多轮互动。

Method: 提出StreamMem，被设计为一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，对视频帧进行流式编码，并通过视觉令牌和通用查询令牌之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时保持固定大小的KV内存以应对内存受限场景。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流媒体视频问答基准上，验证了StreamMem在压缩效率和性能上达到或优于当前最新方法。

Conclusion: StreamMem在处理流媒体长视频场景下的问答任务中展现了高效优质的行为，具有重要研究意义。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为WorldWeaver的框架，解决了长期生成视频中的结构和时间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期视频生成在保结构和时间一致性方面面临挑战，现有方法依赖RGB信号，易导致长时间生成中的错误。

Method: 提出了WorldWeaver框架，通过联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，结合深度线索和分段噪音调度，改善了长期视频生成的时间一致性和运动动态。

Result: 实验表明，WorldWeaver有效减少了时间漂移问题，并提高了生成视频的质量和保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver框架在长期视频生成中表现出色，能显著提高时间一致性，减少漂移并提高生成视频的整体性能。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型视觉基础模型（如SAM）在处理精细语义分割中，特别是识别特定核亚型或细胞时存在困难。

Method: 提出分子增强的All-in-SAM模型，该模型包括分子学习辅助标注、通过SAM适配器进行特定语义学习、以及利用分子导向的校正学习（MOCL）提高分割精度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻标注者的工作负担，还能在资源有限的情况下实现精确的生物医学图像分析，推动医学诊断及病理图像自动化分析发展。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Method: 提出了Hybrid Stream DiT架构以提升模态对齐和训练速度，并通过严格的数据策划流程筛选高质量样本，同时提供详细的训练和推理步骤。

Result: Waver在视频生成任务中表现卓越，能够生成高分辨率的图像和视频，并在两大生成排行榜中排名全球前3，超越其他开源模型甚至匹敌顶尖商用解决方案。

Conclusion: Waver成功统一了图像和视频生成任务，为生成质量和效率设立了新标杆。这项技术报告预计将进一步推动视频生成领域的研究与发展。

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art
commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community

TL;DR: 本文提出ATLAS，一个分离骨骼与外形的新型高保真人体模型，解决了传统模型在复杂体态和多样形状捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体网格建模方法受限于数据多样性和建模假设，无法有效捕捉多样化的人体姿态和形状细节。此外，这些方法通常先优化外部表面后回归内部骨骼，导致外部软组织和内部骨骼之间产生问题依赖，限制了对身高和骨骼长度的直接控制。

Method: 本文提出通过分离形状和骨骼基构建的ATLAS模型，基于从240个同步摄像头捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据学习而成。

Result: 与现有方法相比，ATLAS在拟合未知主体的多样姿势时准确性更高，且其非线性姿态校正能够更有效地捕捉复杂的体态变化。

Conclusion: ATLAS模型提升了形状的表现力，实现了对身体属性的细粒度自定义，并且关键点拟合不依赖外部软组织特性，是更为精准和灵活的高保真建模方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像编辑上有所进展，但其全局去噪过程会导致编辑区域与整个图像的交互性修改问题。为解决这一问题，作者提出采用自回归模型来优化图像编辑表现。

Method: 通过VAREdit框架，将图像编辑问题重新架构为基于逐层预测的多尺度特征生成问题。引入Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) 模块，解决细尺度特征无法有效引导粗尺度目标特征的问题。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，与领先的扩散模型相比，VAREdit的GPT-Balance评分提高了30%以上；在512x512图像编辑任务中，其速度是UltraEdit模型的2.2倍，且精度更高。

Conclusion: VAREdit 引入一种高效的多尺度预测方法，显著提高了基于文本指令图像编辑的效果和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Conclusion: 所提方法适用于多种生成任务，使生成模型能够将多个输出视为统一的整体而非独立的样本，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: CineScale显著扩展了现有视觉生成模型的分辨率能力，为高质量的图像和视频生成提供了创新解决方案，并能在无需或仅需最小微调的情况下取得卓越性能。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种统一的联合训练框架，通过单一监督微调阶段集成多种安全行为（正向、负向、拒绝），并通过系统指令动态激活特定行为，实现高效且灵活的内容安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM内容安全方法（如监督微调和基于人类反馈的强化学习）存在多阶段训练和缺乏部署后精细控制的问题。

Method: 提出统一联合训练框架，通过一个简单的“魔法词”动态激活三种不同的安全行为模式，在单一SFT阶段实现灵活的行为切换。

Result: 实验表明，与SFT+DPO方法相比，本文方法在内容安全上性能相当，同时降低了训练复杂度和部署成本。此外，8B参数模型在安全性能上超过了DeepSeek-R1（671B）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种可扩展、高效且具高度可控性的LLM内容安全解决方案，为多种部署场景提供了强大的安全对策，同时实现了显著的性能提升和成本优化。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现数学文字题的文化本地化，可自动构建包含本地化人名、组织名和货币的多语言数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数学问题的多语言能力因缺乏准确反映本地文化的资源而受限，现有基准多为翻译生成，未考虑本地化文化背景。

Method: 提出了一个利用大型语言模型的框架，从现有资源中自动构建本地化数学文字题数据集，引入本地化实体如名字、组织和货币等。

Result: 实验证明，翻译生成的基准数据可能掩盖数学推理在多语言社会文化背景下的真实能力，所提框架可减少英语中心化偏差并增强模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过框架实现的文化本地化，改进了低资源语言的数学推理性能，表明引入本地化实体能够优化多语言模型的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用有限易得数据资源提高大型语言模型机器翻译性能的方法，并通过斯洛文尼亚语为实例验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过相对少量易于生成的数据资源改进通用指令调优的大型语言模型在机器翻译方面的性能。

Method: 采用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)训练方法，对基于公开数据集程序生成和增强的子集进行训练。通过两个LLM模型生成翻译数据，并利用启发式方法和自动评价指标（如COMET）对翻译质量进行排序，以此生成DPO训练数据。

Result: 优化后的模型在COMET得分上分别比基线模型提升了约0.04和0.02，并更稳定地避免了语言和格式错误。

Conclusion: 通过采用DPO方法对模型进行微调，可以有效提升大语言模型在机器翻译任务中的性能，尤其是对斯洛文尼亚语的应用效果表现显著。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Motivation: 现有的对话式可解释人工智能系统（ConvXAI）在多语言泛化和支持自由形式的用户自定义输入方面存在显著挑战。

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集到包含五种语言的多语言版本MultiCoXQL，并提出新的解析方法。此外，还构建了一个名为Compass的新数据集，用于评估自定义输入提取性能。

Result: 通过对MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集的单语、跨语言和多语言评估，比较了不同大小的LLM和BERT类型模型的性能，验证了解决方案在多语言解析任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究有效地改善了ConvXAI系统在多语言解析和自由形式输入支持方面的性能，同时提供了创新性的数据集和评估基准，为未来相关领域的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的测试阶段对齐算法，称为奖励偏移推测采样 (SSS)，通过使用对齐的小型起草模型降低推理成本，同时保持目标模型不变，从而提升大语言模型对人类偏好的对齐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开发语言模型时，需要找到一种高效的方法在推理阶段对齐模型与人类偏好，同时减少因推理计算带来的成本增加。

Method: 提出奖励偏移推测采样 (SSS) 算法，起草模型通过与人类偏好对齐，提高效率；目标模型不变，通过修改接受标准和奖励分布来恢复最优解决方案。

Result: SSS 算法在弱到强对齐实验中实现了更高的奖励分数，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: SSS 算法提供了一种有效且高效的方式实现人类偏好对齐，适合应用于实际推理阶段的大语言模型优化。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入了LongRecall框架，通过分解回答、语义过滤和结构化验证提升召回评估准确性，用于长文本问答场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律及清单型问答领域，文本生成的完整性至关重要，而现有召回指标存在词汇重叠依赖及语义捕捉不充分等问题。

Method: 提出LongRecall框架，分为三个阶段：分解回答为独立事实、通过词汇与语义逐步缩小匹配范围，并进行结构化的契合验证。

Result: 在三个长文本QA基准数据集上评估，验证了与人类注释和LLM判定相比的显著召回准确性提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall在减少误报与漏报的同时，能适应不同表述与上下文变化，是系统化召回评估的基础构件。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLMs在幻觉现象和复杂推理能力上的不足，尤其在结构化预测领域，作者尝试通过结合 LLM 的预测能力与推理方法的结构一致性来克服这些问题。

Method: 研究了一系列提示策略，评估其对LLM信心值的有效性，并结合符号推理来提高预测质量。此外，还进行了校准和利用结构化预测目标的微调。

Result: 结合符号推理后，预测结果更加一致且准确，并通过校准和结构化预测优化提升了在复杂任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 结构化学习在LLM时代依然具有重要价值，可以通过符号推理与提示融合的方法进一步提升LLM的实际应用能力。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nemotron-CC-Math 通过创新的数据抽取流程构建了高质量的大规模数学语料库，并显著提升了数学和推理能力，成为开放数学预训练数据集的新标杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面向数学的语料库从 Common Crawl 构建时，存在内容质量下降的问题，如提取规则不稳定和数学结构无法保持。因此，需要一种更可靠的科学文本抽取方法来构建高质量语料库。

Method: 开发了一种领域无关的管道，从 Common Crawl 提取高质量科学文本，同时保留数学表达式和代码块的结构完整性。使用 LLM 清理阶段纠正了符号不一致问题，并将表示统一为 LaTeX 格式。

Result: 构建了 Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ 和 Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ 两个高质量数学语料库，分别包含 1330 亿和 520 亿令牌。使用这些语料库对 Nemotron-T 8B 模型进行预训练，性能在多个数学和推理基准上超过强基线模型。

Conclusion: Nemotron-CC-Math 提供了一种从噪声网络数据中提取科学内容的可靠方法，并在数学、代码和一般推理能力上提供了显著提升。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在面对包含错误假设的问题时常生成误导性答案，识别这些问题并减轻幻觉现象是其主要动力。

Method: 提出一种基于事实验证的方式，并通过引入外部证据来识别错误假设，同时提出生成并验证原子假设的方法，以提供可解释的答案。

Result: 实验证明结合外部证据是有效的，生成和验证原子假设方法进一步改善了性能并提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合外部证据和原子假设验证的方法有助于更好地回答带有错误假设的问题，减少模型幻觉的发生。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的数据集MMDR-Bench和一个强化现有LVLMs能力的框架CoLVLM Agent，以解决复杂多模态对话中出现的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs和LVLMs在处理多轮、多模态、需要深度推理和上下文理解的任务时存在局限性，而现有的基准测试未能充分反映实际场景的复杂性。

Method: 开发了MMDR-Bench数据集用于评估多模态对话推理能力，同时提出了无需重训练的CoLVLM Agent框架，采用“记忆-感知-规划-执行”的迭代循环方式提升模型能力。

Result: 经实验，CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上表现出色，其人类评价评分显著高于目前的商用先进模型如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro，在推理深度和指令执行等维度表现尤为优异。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent通过模块化设计和迭代方法在复杂多模态交互中展现了强大的性能，验证了其增强LVLMs能力的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SemToken的语义感知分词框架，通过语义结构优化分词，减少冗余，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分词方法（如BPE或WordPiece）仅基于频率统计，未充分利用文本的语义结构，特别是在长文本场景中存在过度分词和语境不连贯问题。

Method: 利用轻量级编码器提取语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类以合并等价词元；根据语义密度分配不同的词元粒度，在语义信息丰富区域进行精细分词，在重复或低信息区域进行压缩。

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长文本建模基准测试中，实现了词元数减少高达2.4倍，计算速度提升1.9倍，且困惑度和下游任务准确性几乎无损。

Conclusion: 语义结构是优化大语言模型分词和计算的一种新方向，具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Fin-PRM的领域专业化过程奖励模型，用于改进大语言模型在金融任务中的中间推理能力，表现超越了通用PRM和其他金融基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型主要面向通用或STEM领域，难以适应金融领域对推理的结构化、符号式及合规性需求。

Method: Fin-PRM结合了步骤级和轨迹级的奖励监督，通过细粒度评价对齐金融逻辑。在离线和在线奖励学习场景下，支持推理轨迹选择、强化学习奖励生成以及测试时的奖励指导。

Result: 在多项金融推理基准上，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上超越了通用PRM和强基线，其训练下的下游模型在监督学习、强化学习和测试性能上分别提升了12.9%、5.2%和5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模能有效提升大语言模型在金融领域的专家级推理能力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK通过在KV缓存中应用通道级稀疏性，大幅降低内存开销并提高处理效能，且与现有方法兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型（LLMs）中长序列推理受限于KV缓存瓶颈，现有方法未结合通道轴的重要性差异，导致效率和准确性的平衡受限。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，通过在通道级进行KV裁剪并在注意力计算时动态还原，减少冗余，提升KV缓存效率，具备即插即用特性。

Result: SPARK在同等记忆需求下支持处理更长序列，并在减少30%以上KV缓存存储占用的同时，提升或保持模型精度，即使在80%裁剪比例下，性能下降也不超过5%。

Conclusion: SPARK提高了KV缓存效率并保持模型性能，同时与现有技术兼容，为大语言模型的长序列处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SEER的自引导方法，通过逐步回忆和更新经验池改进大语言模型的工具交互能力，并在多项基准上展示了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多步工具使用中仍面临选择工具、生成参数和工具链规划的困难，而现有方法需要大量人工设计或特定任务示范，导致工程复杂性和效率降低。

Method: 提出了SEER，一种逐步回忆经验的方法，动态扩展经验池，通过从成功的过去轨迹中学习，递增优化模型能力，无需依赖静态或手工策划的知识库。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，复杂问题上提升4.7%；在现实领域的τ-bench测试中，分别提升了7.44%和23.38%。

Conclusion: SEER无需大量人工设计，通过动态更新经验池，实现了工具使用场景中的高效性能改进，表明其在实际应用中具有可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用大语言模型进行生成任务自动评估时的模糊性问题，并探索了自动生成检查清单的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成任务中，由于评价标准常常存在模糊性，研究尝试通过自动生成检查清单来改善这一问题。

Method: 通过六种方法生成检查清单，并在八种模型规模上验证它们的效果，同时分析哪些清单项目与人工评估结果相关。

Result: 发现选择性使用检查清单在成对比较任务中提升评估性能，但在直接打分任务中的效果不一致。此外，低相关性检查项目也往往反映了人类标准，说明人类评估标准存在潜在不一致性。

Conclusion: 明确和客观的评估标准对于指导人类和自动化评估都非常重要，这为未来的研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态词汇选择框架VocabTailor，有效解决了小型语言模型在边缘设备部署中的词汇相关内存限制问题，显著减少内存占用且性能几乎无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前小型语言模型虽能在资源受限环境中运作，但由于大词汇量导致的内存占用问题限制了其在边缘设备上的部署。现有的静态词汇修剪方法因缺乏灵活性及一刀切设计导致信息损失，难以有效解决内存瓶颈。

Method: 提出了VocabTailor框架，结合词汇局部性和词汇部件计算特性不对称性，采用解耦式动态词汇选择策略，通过词嵌入的卸载和语言模型头部的静态-动态混合词汇选择，实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 实验结果表明，VocabTailor在减少词汇相关组件内存使用上可达99%，任务性能几乎无损，显著优于静态修剪方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor有效解决了小型语言模型内存限制问题，为在边缘设备部署语言模型提供了有效途径，并在不牺牲性能的前提下优化了资源使用效率。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在低资源语言（如泰语）上的指令理解与处理能力，弥补现有方法中缺乏文化与专业特定语境模型性能评估的不足。

Method: 通过多人质控流程，结合注释员、领域专家与AI研究人员，共同创建了专注于泰语的WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，涵盖四大专业领域和七种任务类型；并进行了零样本评估与指令调优实验。

Result: 实验表明，基于WangchanThaiInstruct优化的模型在域内与跨域任务上的表现优于基于翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在低资源、多语言背景下，基于文化和专业特定语境的数据对模型对齐和性能优化至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

Motivation: 通过改善代码切换数据的稀缺性，促进多语种语音技术的发展。

Method: 提出了UniCoM管道，其中包含SWORDS算法，通过替换单词为翻译词生成代码切换语料。并构建了CS-FLEURS多语种语料库。

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在语音识别和语音到文本翻译任务中的表现具备高度可理解性和自然性，与现有数据集表现相当。

Conclusion: 这一方法预期能推进代码切换语音技术的发展，并促进更包容的多语种系统的实现。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）作为教育角色心理和伦理表现的框架EMNLP，并显示出LLMs在道德推理和教师角色中的独特表现，同时揭示了其易受有害提示注入的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何使大语言模型充当职业角色，例如教师，并评估这些模型在心理和伦理层面的适应性和潜在风险，特别是在道德发展和伦理风险方面。

Method: 提出EMNLP框架，包括个性剖析、道德发展阶段测量及基于软提示注入的伦理风险评估，开发出88种教师特定的道德困境情境，并通过一组软提示注入评估教师角色的语言模型在合规性及脆弱性方面的表现。

Result: 通过对12种LLMs实验，发现教师角色的LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的个性，在抽象道德推理中具有更高能力，但在情感复杂的场景中表现较差。推理能力强的模型更易受有害提示注入影响，展现了能力和安全间的矛盾。此外，模型的温度和其他超参数对风险行为的影响有限。

Conclusion: 研究展示了用于评估教育AI中教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐性的首个基准，并揭示了模型能力和安全之间的潜在矛盾，为未来职业角色AI的发展和评估提供了指导。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为CARE的改进方法，旨在解决RAG中的上下文与模型知识间的冲突问题，实现可靠且自适应的生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前RAG系统在结合外部知识时，当检索到的上下文与LLM的内在知识矛盾时，容易出现判断错误的现象，亟需一种方法来识别并解决上下文和模型内在知识之间的冲突。

Method: 提出一种新框架CARE，包括上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过处理记忆嵌入，结合软提示学习辨别不可靠的上下文，指导推理朝向更可靠的知识来源。

Result: 通过实验，CARE在问答和事实核查基准测试中表现显著提升，平均提升5.0%。

Conclusion: CARE有效减少上下文与模型记忆冲突问题，开辟了可信且自适应的RAG系统的新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Motivation: 为了理解事件的时间背景，机器需要能够推断时间常识，例如某些经历的时间跨度，而这类信息往往在文本中不明确表达。

Method: 提出一个基于大语言模型（LLMs）的时间常识提取流程，利用此流程从文本中挖掘时间常识，并生成TComQA数据集。

Result: TComQA数据集经过众包验证，提取时间常识的精度超过80%，并且训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于在现有数据集上微调的模型。

Conclusion: 自动挖掘时间常识对创建更健壮的语言模型至关重要，本研究提出的方法能有效提取和利用时间常识，提高相关任务性能。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 很多语音处理任务需要与语境无关的纯音素表示，为满足此需求，作者开发了CUPE模型。

Method: CUPE通过独立处理长度为120毫秒的短定宽窗口，学习各语言通用的基础声学模式，使用自监督和有监督学习进行训练。

Result: 尽管参数较少，CUPE在跨语言任务中表现出很强的泛化能力，并能在零样本测试中取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 通过在音素长度的窗口内建模基础声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的知识图谱补全模型的评估受到数据集间和指标间不一致的困扰，难以全面比较模型优劣。

Method: 提出了一种名为EDAS的元参量，将模型在多数据集和多指标下的表现综合成单一的归一化分数（$M_i ∈ [0,1]$）。

Result: 通过实验验证，EDAS能够在FB15k-237和WN18RR等基准数据集上有效整合多指标和多数据集的表现为统一排名。

Conclusion: EDAS为知识图谱补全模型提供了一个一致、稳健和通用的评估框架，为模型选择和公平比较奠定了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）尽管能力显著提升，但在可信性（如真实性、安全性、公平性、隐私等方面）上存在严重问题，现有方法多为局部性，且忽略了多模态带来的额外风险。

Method: 定义了一个三维框架，包括五个可信性方面（真实性、稳健性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、两种新风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）、以及从数据、模型架构、训练和推理算法角度提出的多种缓解策略。提供32个任务及28个数据集，评估30种不同模型，测试8种缓解方法，并基于研究推出了一种称为RESA的推理增强安全对齐方法。

Result: 实验结果揭示了目前模型存在严重漏洞，包括可信性与一般能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理放大了潜在的底层风险。此外，现有缓解策略效果有限，在提升某些方面的同时往往伴随意外的权衡和副作用。

Conclusion: 通过提出和验证RESA方法，显示推理能力在平衡模型安全性与性能上的实际效果，同时为提升MLLM可信性和安全性提供了切实可行的思路。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投机解码方法在静态推导长度和刚性验证标准方面缺乏适应性，难以应对不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度。

Method: 基于置信度调节的信息论框架，通过熵和基于边距的不确定性特征动态调整每次迭代中生成的代币数量，同时利用置信信号优化验证流程。

Result: 该方法在机器翻译和摘要任务中实现了较传统投机解码更显著的加速效果，同时保存或提升了BLEU和ROUGE分数。

Conclusion: 该方法为在不同不确定条件下实现高效且鲁棒的大模型解码提供了一种原则性、易于集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Motivation: 研究者希望明确语言模型中词汇量增大的益处来源及其训练动态以指导模型设计。

Method: 控制数据、计算和优化参数，调节模型词汇量大小，考察对文本复杂性和损失分解的影响，并分析高频词与低频词的表现差异。

Result: 发现较大的词汇量主要通过降低高频单词的不确定性来改进模型性能，但对低频单词的损失贡献增加。此外，限制嵌入规范可以逆转增益，展示模型通过不平衡性获益。

Conclusion: 更大的词汇量帮助降低文本复杂性，从而改进语言模型的性能。这为分词器与模型的协同设计提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了MCR-BENCH基准，首次全面评估大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在处理音频和文本冲突信息时的表现，发现其对文本有显著偏向，影响实际应用的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在多模态数据处理中的表现尚未充分研究，尤其是应对音频与文本信息冲突的能力。

Method: 本研究引入MCR-BENCH作为基准，通过一系列音频理解任务系统性评估LALMs在处理冲突音频文本对时的信息优先级表现。此外，分析模型的文本偏向成因并尝试通过监督微调和模型信心模式分析来改进。

Result: 研究表明，LALMs在音频和文本冲突场景中存在显著文本偏向，导致音频相关任务性能显著下降。同时，模型在处理冲突多模态输入时表现出过高的自信。

Conclusion: 需要改进训练过程中的模态平衡处理和融合机制，以增强模型应对多模态冲突输入的稳健性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出LLaSO，作为首个完全开放的大规模语音语言模型框架，旨在解决模型架构分散和透明性不足的问题，包含对齐语料库、任务数据集和标准评估基准等资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于模型架构分散及透明性不足，语音语言模型领域难以实现系统比较和重复性研究。现有模型常缺乏训练数据及配置的公开。

Method: 本文推出开放框架LLaSO，包含三大资源：LLaSO-Align语音文本对齐语料库、LLaSO-Instruct多任务训练数据集、LLaSO-Eval标准评估基准。并提供基于此训练的参考模型LLaSO-Base。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型在公开数据上实现了0.72的归一化评分，表现优于同类模型。同时分析表明，虽然更广泛的训练覆盖提升了性能，但在纯音频任务上仍存在显著推广性不足。

Conclusion: LLaSO通过公开数据、基准和模型，提供了一个开放标准，统一研究方向并加速语音语言模型领域的发展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Result: 通过对隐私保护语言建模方法的研究，提供了宝贵的见解，并为今后的研究方向打下基础。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了隐私风险的重要性，并指出了隐私保护语言建模领域的潜在改进方向及未来研究重点。

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨翻译中非等值词的渲染问题，提供方法和规则，并渲染了25个非等值词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于每种语言都有许多没有等值翻译的地方性或内部词汇（如食物、服装、文化和传统相关词汇），这些词汇的翻译需要特别的研究以避免误解。

Method: 采用基于文献的研究方法，总结出从源语言到目标语言渲染非等值词汇的方法和规则。

Result: 完成了25个来自Dar和乌兹别克语的非等值词汇翻译到英语和俄语。

Conclusion: 研究提供了翻译非等值词汇的规范化方法和成果，拓展了语言翻译理解领域。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PyTOD的对话系统，通过生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并凭借语义模型而非语法规则，实现了对API架构的精确对接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前任务导向型对话系统在对话状态跟踪方面存在不足，迫切需要一种能够有效解决状态跟踪和错误校正的问题。

Method: PyTOD使用受限解码方法，结合语言模型生成可执行代码，依赖策略和执行反馈对状态跟踪进行迭代改进。

Result: PyTOD在SGD基准测试中表现优异，实现了最先进的状态跟踪性能，并在对话的用户目标估计中超越了现有的强基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过执行感知状态跟踪的创新方法，PyTOD验证了生成代码并结合语言模型进行对话管理的有效性，显示出在面对复杂对话情景时的强大潜力。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出RadReason框架，用于放射学报告的评估，提供细粒度评分和可解释理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对放射学报告的自动评估缺乏基于临床、可解释且细粒度的指标；现有方法无法适用于实际临床工作流。

Method: 提出RadReason框架，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，包含动态加权和多数指导优势缩放两个创新，用以改进政策梯度更新和优化。

Result: 在ReXVal基准上，RadReason优于所有现有离线指标，与GPT-4评估表现相当，同时具备可解释性、成本效益及临床部署性。

Conclusion: RadReason在评估放射学报告方面表现优异，兼具高效和临床适应性。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: SLM4Offer模型通过对T5-Small语言模型进行对比学习微调，用于生成个性化优惠，实验表明提高了17%的优惠接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过个性化营销提升客户参与度和业务增长，解决推荐系统和个性化广告中市场潜力未充分挖掘的问题。

Method: 基于T5-Small语言模型，采用对比学习和InfoNCE丢失函数，调整客群与优惠的嵌入空间对齐，增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 与基准方法相比，SLM4Offer模型的优惠接受率提高了17%。

Conclusion: 使用对比学习优化个性化生成的潜力，提高了优惠的接受率，验证了对比学习方法在个性化营销中的应用价值。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决现有大语言模型不能很好捕捉用户个性化行为和偏好的问题，尤其在网页浏览等主观行为领域中。

Method: 提出了HeTLM框架，基于页面级标记器的小型语言模型，并结合异质性集群具体的参数设置，提升语言模型的表现力和对主观行为的适应性。

Result: 实验显示，小型语言模型优于大型预训练或微调模型，且在同等参数量情况下，HeTLM显著提升了表现均值并降低了方差。

Conclusion: HeTLM框架能够更好地适应用户主观行为，实现性能均匀且对用户对齐良好的模型训练。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过训练数据影响力（而非传统人类定义难度）排序的课程学习可以提升语言模型预训练效果，性能提升超过10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨课程学习技术如何在语言模型预训练中取得更大的成功，尤其着眼于采用模型中心的难度指标。

Method: 通过训练数据影响力分数对训练样本进行排序，以此定义课程学习的训练数据排序方式，并进行实验分析。

Result: 基于训练数据影响力的课程学习比随机顺序训练提升超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 课程学习对于语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要采用更偏向模型训练行为的难度定义。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出第一个希伯来语社交身份检测数据集HebID，以以色列政客的Facebook帖子和议会演讲为基础，研究政治语言中的社交身份表达及其与公众身份优先级的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份检测数据集偏重英语，单标签且主要针对粗略身份分类，但政治语言的身份表达具有文化和语言的复杂性。因此需要多语言、多标签和更精细的身份检测数据来研究。

Method: 开发了HebID数据集，包括手动标注的5536句以色列政客Facebook帖子中的细腻社交身份标签，并使用多种编码器和大规模生成型语言模型（LLM）进行基准测试和分析。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM在身份检测方面表现最佳，宏平均F1分数达到0.74；将分类器应用于以色列政客的演讲和帖子，分析了身份表达的流行度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别差异。

Conclusion: HebID为研究希伯来语中的社交身份语言提供了全面基础，也可为其他非英语政治语境的研究提供示范。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Conclusion: Dream 7B 展示了扩散语言建模的广泛潜力，为后续相关研究提供了新的模型及工具。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

*Xiangyang Zhu,Yuan Tian,Chunyi Li,Kaiwei Zhang,Wei Sun,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全自动构建大型语言模型安全性评估基准的方法，名为SafetyFlow。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM安全评估基准过于依赖人工且效率低下，因此需要一种自动化且优化的解决方案。

Method: 开发了SafetyFlow系统，通过七个专门的代理模块协作，在完全无人干预的情况下构建安全基准。

Result: 利用SafetyFlow构建的SafetyFlowBench包含23,446条查询，具有低冗余高区分性，并测试了49个先进LLM的安全性。

Conclusion: SafetyFlow显著减少了构建基准的时间和资源消耗，为LLM安全评估提供了更高效的工具，并开创了全自动评估流程的先例。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SDGO的强化学习框架，通过模型自带的判别能力引导生成能力优化，从而提升生成安全性，并显著提升了模型对越界攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型虽然在自然语言处理中表现出色，但在生成有害内容防御上较脆弱，而它们在识别有害请求上表现更强，这种矛盾性促使作者探索如何对齐模型的判别与生成能力。

Method: SDGO是一种强化学习框架，不需要额外标注数据和外部模型，利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进提升生成的安全性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SDGO在提高模型安全性以及对越界攻击的鲁棒性上优于现有的基于prompt和训练的方法，同时在一般基准任务上保持高效性。

Conclusion: 通过对齐大型语言模型的判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了更紧密的能力协同，同时仅需少量判别样本便可进一步提升生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Method: 引入SurGE基准，包括测试实例（主题描述、专家综述、引用文献）和百万篇论文组成的学术语料库，并提出自动化评估框架从信息覆盖率、引用准确性等方面评估生成综述。

Result: 即使是先进的自我反思框架，生成的综述仍存在显著困难，体现了任务的复杂性和研究的必要性。

Conclusion: SurGE基准及评估体系的推出为自动化科学综述生成领域的研究奠定了基础，但任务的实现仍需持续深入的研究和技术改进。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Positional bias (PB)影响长上下文理解，提出Pos2Distill框架，通过知识蒸馏减小不同位置间的性能差距，提高长上下文任务表现和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨并解决由位置偏置导致长上下文任务性能差距的问题，提高系统在长上下文任务中的表现和位置通用性。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill框架，利用知识蒸馏从有优势的位置向劣势位置传递能力。根据检索和推理任务的不同需求，设计了Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²两个变体。

Result: 通过Pos2Distill框架，各位置表现更趋统一，在长上下文检索和推理任务中取得显著的性能提升；跨任务表现和泛化能力突出。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill框架有效缓解位置偏置问题，实现了跨任务提升和长上下文任务的性能突破。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 在全球广泛使用却缺乏数字资源的孟加拉语中，词干提取至关重要，它能通过减少算法处理的词数来降低复杂性。

Method: 对现有研究进行系统性综述，分析当前针对孟加拉语词干提取的技术和评估方法，并提出改进方向。

Result: 发现孟加拉语词干提取在文献上的研究断层和资源稀缺，评估技术存在不足，并提出开发更合适的工具和指标的需求。

Conclusion: 需要开发更健壮的孟加拉语词干提取工具，并强调该领域持续研究的重要性，以提高语言分析能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了电商平台多模态数据的作用，提出数据集EcomMMMU，并提出方法SUMEI，用于改善多模态任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集的规模和设计不足，无法系统研究多模态数据（如产品图像）对产品理解的影响。

Method: 提出EcomMMMU数据集和模型SUMEI，通过预测视觉效用来更好地利用多张图像进行下游任务。

Result: 分析表明图像并不总是提升性能，甚至可能导致性能下降。SUMEI实验表现证明其有效性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 产品图像对任务的影响较复杂，SUMEI可以更好地利用图像信息，从而提供方法改进。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Deep-DxSearch的系统，通过强化学习实现了可追溯的医学诊断增强推理，显著提高诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的医学大语言模型因知识漏洞和错误推理而导致诊断不准确，即使结合检索和工具增强，效果也十分有限。研究旨在克服外部知识利用效率低和推理可追溯性差的挑战。

Method: 构建了一个大规模医学检索语料库，包括患者记录和可靠的医学知识来源，以支持诊断推理；将LLM视为核心代理，检索语料为其环境，通过格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性的奖励机制，用大规模数据强化学习发展系统能力。

Result: Deep-DxSearch在多数据中心的实验中超越了提示工程和无训练RAG方法，诊断准确率超过了强基线（如GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1）等，对常见和罕见疾病均有效，并在分布内外的情境下表现稳定。

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch系统通过创新的奖励设计和检索语料构建，大幅提升了诊断准确率，证明其方法比传统实现更具优势，同时提供了有助于临床医生决策的解释性分析。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 鉴于大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现有限且计算能力不足，研究试图探讨工具集成推理（TIR）是否能改善模型的推理能力与效率。

Method: 引入ReasonZoo基准测试和两个新指标（PAC与AUC-PCC）来系统性评估TIR在九个不同推理领域的表现。

Result: 实验表明，采用TIR的大语言模型在数学和非数学任务中均优于未集成TIR的模型，并改进了推理效率。

Conclusion: 研究验证了TIR对推理任务的普适性改善以及对提升大语言模型复杂推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101为评估AI代理的工具使用与多步骤任务解决能力提供了严格标准，推进可靠自主AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，利用图信号处理（GSP）作为主要的计算框架来结合符号逻辑与神经推理，显著提升了推理系统的逻辑一致性、可解释性以及计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型通常将图频谱方法作为辅助组件，无法充分发挥其潜力，需要一种更具一体化和数学基础的框架来提高神经符号推理的性能与效率。

Method: 通过引入图信号处理，将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，并利用可学习的频谱滤波器来控制多尺度信息传播，最终映射成符号谓词用于基于规则的推理。同时，提出了频谱推理数学框架，包括图傅里叶变换、带选择注意力及频谱规则约束。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建稳健和可解释的推理系统提供了一个具有数学基础且高效的计算框架。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决传统上奖励函数和状态表述分开设计的不足之处，提供一种更紧凑的目标导向学习体系。

Method: 作者介绍了一个新框架，基于佛教认识论概念提出'目标导向状态（telic states）'，通过统计偏离行为策略和期望经验特征之间的关系进行学习。

Result: 提出了一个能解释行为、现象学和神经活动的统一观点，并通过文献支持说明了该框架的可能适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能更好地描述各种智能体中的目标导向行为，并统一了多种关于意识和行为的认知领域。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Collab-REC的多代理框架，通过结合多种观点来缓解旅游推荐中的热门偏见并提升多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐系统在旅游场景中存在热门偏见问题，难以平衡个性化、多样性和可持续性目标，需探索多利益相关者协作的途径。

Method: 利用三个基于LLM的代理（分别从个性化、受欢迎程度和可持续性角度出发）进行多轮协商，并通过一个非LLM的调解器整合建议，剔除不合理或重复的结果。

Result: 在实验中，与单一代理基线相比，Collab-REC提升了推荐系统的多样性和整体相关性，特别是发现了许多较少被访问的旅游地点。

Conclusion: Collab-REC的多利益相关者协作方法为LLM驱动的推荐系统提供了新的思路，有助于解决过度旅游问题并满足用户约束。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

Conclusion: 利用LLMs在群体模拟中充分结合语言和社会交互，可以自然地产生更多样化和真实的群体行为模式。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [125] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大语言模型在增强推理预算时，其置信度校准能力反而下降，但通过搜索增强的生成方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的置信度校准能力，并测试推理能力和预算的影响。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集及其扩展数据，系统研究推理能力和预算对置信度评估的影响，比较增强推理与搜索增强生成的效果。

Result: 增加推理预算会导致系统性过度自信，而搜索增强生成明显提升置信度评估准确率，从48.7%提升至89.3%。

Conclusion: 信息获取能力比推理深度或预算更关键，是改进知识密集型任务中置信度校准的瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: S3LoRA通过一种名为MAS-SVD的技术分析并修剪不安全的LoRA更新层，从而提高大语言模型的安全性，同时保持性能和降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PEFT技术可能在适配大语言模型时导致安全性问题，尤其是在任务规划中。需要一种无需基础模型检查点且更广泛适用的安全适配方案。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架，借助MAS-SVD分析LoRA更新的结构性质，设计了SSI指标以检测不安全的层，并对其进行剪枝以降低风险。

Result: S3LoRA在多个任务上的实验表明其能够在提高安全性指标的同时，不牺牲性能，且明显降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA是一种有效且可扩展的方案，可在资源受限的实际应用环境中安全部署使用LLM的智能体。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Method: 提出了一种框架——开放宇宙辅助游戏（OU-AGs），并提出一种称为GOOD（从开放对话中提取目标）的在线方法，该方法通过与人类互动获取自然语言形式的目标，并通过概率推理处理这些目标。

Result: 在文本基础上的杂货购物以及一个模拟家庭机器人（AI2Thor）的场景中，通过合成用户数据进行评估，GOOD优于不进行显式目标追踪的基线方法。

Conclusion: 此方法实现了无需大规模离线数据集的高效目标建模和不确定性估计，在开放的人工智能目标推理场景中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为了解决现有LLM生成数据集在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性上的不足，提出了PuzzleClone框架，通过SMT生成大规模、可验证的高质量逻辑和数学数据集，并在逻辑与数学基准测试中表现出显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型的推理能力需要依赖高质量、可验证的数学和逻辑数据集，但现有的数据集生成技术存在可靠性、多样性及可扩展性的问题。

Method: 提出PuzzleClone框架：(1) 将种子谜题编码为逻辑规范，(2) 通过变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，(3) 通过再现机制确保数据有效性；同时构建了包含83K多样化验证谜题的数据集。

Result: 在PuzzleClone重新训练后，模块测试集性能从14.4增加到56.2，且在7个逻辑和数学基准测试上平均提升了12.5个百分点，具体如AMC2023从52.5提升到65.0。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架提升了数据生成的可靠性、多样性和可扩展性，并显著增强了模型在逻辑和数学任务上的推理能力。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 目前缺乏开放性、全面的外科创伤数据集和诊断工具，隐私和数据成本问题阻碍了相关研究的进展。

Method: 构建并公开了SurgWound数据集，同时提出三阶段学习框架WoundQwen：第一阶段用5个模型预测创伤特征，第二阶段用结果进行感染风险评估并指导干预，第三阶段生成综合诊断报告。

Result: 实现了外科创伤细节的准确分析和个性化的患者指导，通过多模型协作提升了诊断性能。

Conclusion: SurgWound数据集和WoundQwen框架为外科创伤诊断和治疗提供了重要工具，有助于实现精准医疗和患者康复。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在医疗领域使用大规模语言模型（LLMs）面临数据匮乏和不可靠的问题，尤其是针对像多汗症这类罕见疾病，因此需要开发专门的模型以弥补这一领域的研究差距。

Method: 提出LLM4Sweat框架，该框架包括三阶段管道：数据增强阶段通过LLMs生成医学合理的综合病例；微调阶段在此基础上对开源模型进行微调；推理与专家评估阶段，专家对系统诊断结果的准确性、适当性和共情能力进行评估，并通过反馈完善数据集。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4Sweat在性能上优于基线模型，是针对多汗症的首个开源LLM框架，同时提供了处理其他罕见疾病的可推广方法。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat体系不仅准备用于改善多汗症诊断和治疗，还为类似罕见疾病的数据稀缺和可信性问题提供了解决方案，为医疗应用中的大规模语言模型研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理高约束条件下推理的可靠性需要进一步探索。

Method: 设计了一个基准测试框架R-ConstraintBench，通过逐渐增加调度问题的约束复杂性，评估模型的性能。

Result: 强大的模型在简单约束场景表现良好，但在复杂约束（如停机时间、时间窗口及析取约束）下性能显著下降，且难以从简单基准迁移至复杂领域环境。

Conclusion: 约束交互是性能瓶颈，简单基准表现不代表实际复杂环境中的模型能力。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手绘草图转化为精确、可组合图形（如流程图）具有挑战，现有扩散模型虽擅长生成逼真的图像，但在空间精度、对齐及符号结构等方面表现不足。

Method: 提出一个结合视觉语言模型（VLM）与大语言模型（LLM）的系统。系统通过循环迭代过程完成图形转换，由VLM提供编辑建议，多个LLM生成不同策略的SVG更新，最终由VLM评估最佳候选方案，保证稳定改进。

Result: 在从已发布论文中提取的10个草图上，该方法在忠实重构布局和结构方面优于现有闭源生成模型（GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro）。输出程序化的SVG便于扩展到演示工具并支持特殊任务优化。

Conclusion: 这种结合VLM和LLM的创新方法在符号和结构精确性上实现了显著提升，并对实际应用（如流程图绘制工具）具有重要意义，代码已经开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 提出的算法克服了传统方法的不足，提供了多指标上的显著改进，为实现平衡的城市土地用途分配提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的三种方法，且消融实验证明了记忆单元设计的合理性，分析也显示该方法在选取记忆片段数量和存储开销上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多重记忆系统(MMS)设计有效提升了语言模型利用历史数据的能力，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory的新框架，通过多粒度的记忆设计和LLM结合，提高复杂规划任务的适应性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基于单一粒度的记忆机制在知识多样性和规划灵活性上存在一定局限性。

Method: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory通过粗粒度到细粒度的记忆组合，与LLM结合。训练时首先通过粗粒度信息指导经验收集，再细粒度处理可执行的规划提示；推理时通过多粒度记忆检索实现灵活规划和异常修正。

Result: 方法能够检索与任务相关的经验并应对环境异常，实现更加灵活的自反思与规划校正。

Conclusion: 通过多粒度记忆，提出的框架提高了知识多样性和规划灵活性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPW的新方法，将专家演示和偏好反馈结合起来，更有效地进行离线强化学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前离线强化学习中依赖复杂奖励函数及两种人类反馈方式(专家演示和偏好标注)各自的局限性。

Method: 引入SPW方案，通过搜索专家演示中与偏好标注轨迹中转移最相似的状态-动作对，并根据相似性分数生成逐步的重要性权重，用于优化偏好学习中的信用分配。

Result: 实验证明SPW在结合偏好和专家演示数据时，在机器人操控任务中超过了此前的方法表现。

Conclusion: SPW方法可以高效地联合利用人类偏好与专家演示数据，实现更准确的信用分配和决策学习。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出一个新的数据集RETAIL和一个多智能体框架TGMA，以解决现有自动化旅行规划系统在处理隐式需求、不考虑环境因素、以及生成详细计划等方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统无法满足真实世界复杂需求，主要体现在对隐式需求的识别能力弱、缺乏环境意识、多样化偏好支持有限以及无法生成细节丰富的旅行计划。

Method: 构建RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式需求的规划，同时提出一个主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA，用于综合解决旅行规划的多种复杂性问题。

Result: 实验显示，即使是当前最强的模型，通过率仅为1.0%，而TGMA提升至2.72%，显著提高实际旅行规划性能。

Conclusion: TGMA框架在真实旅行规划中展现了较大潜力，为未来的应用和研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图诊断方法在任务推广和开放式推理方面存在局限，亟需新的解决方案。

Method: DiagECG通过离散化生成符号化心电图标记，并扩展语言模型词汇，以实现ECG和自然语言输入统一建模；同时预训练ECG预测任务，并调优于问答和诊断报告生成任务。

Result: DiagECG在任务表现优异，能推广到分布外场景，并证明其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 将符号化心电图嵌入大语言模型，提高医疗推理能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and

minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在复杂逻辑推理任务中表现优异，但推理链过长会导致资源浪费和响应速度下降，需要一种能动态调节推理长度的机制。

Method: 提出了一个分块结构（Think in Blocks）：模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后据此分段推理。通过三个阶段的训练流程（监督微调、偏好优化和强化学习），实现根据任务难度动态调整推理深度。此外，在推理过程中利用块数控制推理深度。

Result: 证明了该框架在不同难度的任务中表现出色，并且显著提高了模型的计算效率和响应速度。

Conclusion: “分块思维”框架有效解决了推理链过长的问题，提供了适应性强、灵活的推理机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: 研究为多代理AI系统设计提供了框架，有助其协作能力发展并与人类价值对齐。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Conclusion: DeepThink3D增强了LLMs在复杂3D情景推理任务中的表现，为提升模型复杂问题处理能力提供了新的方法。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略的鲁棒性和安全性提供了科学的定量评估方法，有助于更广泛地应用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACT-R的声明性记忆系统存在局限性，例如在可扩展性和数据相似性度量上的不足。而全息声明性记忆（HDM）提供了一种基于向量符号处理的替代方案，可能解决这些问题。

Method: 本文将HDM适配于Lisp版本的ACT-R，使得现有基于声明性记忆的ACT-R模型可以无缝运行。同时开发了基于向量的功能，如文本处理管道和新的记忆块检索机制。

Result: 研究表明HDM在无需存储实际记忆块的情况下仍可高效回忆记忆内容，并且可与现有ACT-R模型高兼容性地运行。

Conclusion: 通过对HDM模块的改进，展示了其潜在的扩展性和优势，特别是在基于实例学习的决策模型开发中展现了潜力。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了对合作动态的全新见解，提升了MARL系统的可解释性，并有助于分析和优化智能体行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Result: 提出了“未来性”概念，揭示数据增强性能、深化个性化以及扩展应用领域的递归特性，并强调技术寡头在价值和决策集中中的主导作用。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全面的测量方法，用于评估AI推理工作负载在实际生产环境中的能源使用、碳排放和水消耗，并以Google AI基础设施为例进行了实测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究尚未在生产环境中测量AI推理的环境指标，而随着AI应用的普及，理解并缓解其环境影响显得尤为重要。

Method: 提出了一种综合方法，评估AI推理的能源使用、碳排放和水消耗，全面考虑AI服务基础设施的完整栈，包括主动AI加速器功耗、主机系统能耗、机器闲置容量以及数据中心能源开销。

Result: 以Google Gemini AI助手为实验对象，测量结果显示，其单次文本请求的能耗为0.24 Wh，比多项公开估算值低，并且在一年的时间内，通过软件效率改进和清洁能源采购使能耗降低了33倍，碳排放减少44倍。

Conclusion: 尽管AI推理的环境影响较其他日常活动低，但其影响仍需引起重视，文章建议以全面测量作为比较模型与激励全栈效率提升的重要基础。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理与人类建立类社交关系可能产生严重负面影响，有必要研发监测和预防此类关系的工具。

Method: 利用一种最先进的语言模型，构建一个简单的响应评估框架以实时检测对话中的类社交线索，并使用一个小型合成数据集进行试验。

Result: 在构建的30个对话数据集上进行测试，成功识别了所有类社交对话且未出现误判，尤其在对话初期便可实现识别。

Conclusion: 评估代理为防止类社交关系的形成提供了一个可行的解决方案，并具有初步实证支持。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了利用多智能体大语言模型的语言引导调优框架（LGT），通过自然语言推理优化机器学习配置，在六个数据集上表现优于传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统方法独立处理机器学习配置不同维度且缺乏解释性，以及自动化方法缺少动态适应性和语义推理能力的问题，引入一种基于语言的优化框架。

Method: LGT框架采用三个专门的智能体：Advisor 提出配置变更建议，Evaluator 评估优化效果，以及 Optimizer 优化决策过程。同时利用文本梯度提供训练动态和配置相互作用的语义理解，形成自我改进的反馈机制。

Result: 在六个不同的数据集上，LGT框架显著优于传统方法，在性能提升的同时保留了高解释性。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过优化方案的自然语言推理和语义理解，有效解决了配置优化中的关键挑战，展示了在动态适应性和模型性能上的潜力。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在致力于减少交通事故死亡率并提升运输效率的过程中，安全且具伦理决策能力的自动驾驶车辆成为重点研究方向。

Method: 研究使用一种分层的Safe RL框架，在决策层通过结合伦理风险综合成本（碰撞概率和伤害严重性）训练RL代理，在执行层采用路径规划与PID和Stanley控制器实现运动目标。

Result: 在涵盖多种车辆、行人、自行车的真实交通数据上测试，本文方法在减少伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 首次将Safe RL应用到真实场景中的自动驾驶伦理决策，说明了结合控制理论和数据驱动学习的潜力，为复杂混合交通环境中的伦理责任自动驾驶奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种个性化肺癌风险预测方法，通过检索和推理技术动态选择最佳模型，为每位患者提供量身定制的风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前肺癌风险预测模型在不同患者群体和临床环境中的性能差异较大，缺乏统一的最佳综合解决方案，因此需要一种动态适应患者实际情况的方法。

Method: 作者设计了一种两阶段的智能代理系统，首先利用基于FAISS的相似性检索，在多机构数据库中查找与患者最相关的群体；然后利用大型语言模型（LLM）结合检索到的群体信息及其性能数据，从八种预测模型中推荐最佳模型。

Result: 该代理系统整合了检索与推理技术，实现了动态、个性化的肺癌风险预测，并支持在各类临床人群中的灵活应用。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为基于具体患者特征的个性化风险评估开辟了可行路径，可推广至实际肺癌筛查场景中应用。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Motivation: 当前帕金森病进展预测面临症状演变复杂性高及时间依赖性建模不足的问题。

Method: 方法采用图神经网络建模症状间的结构关系，引入图表示捕获语义依赖，并使用Transformer架构刻画进展过程中的动态时间特征。同时设计了结构感知门控机制融合结构和时间信息。

Conclusion: 该框架表现出卓越的泛化性与结构可扩展性，为慢性症状性疾病智能建模提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于文本分类的NAS模型缺乏层次混合结构，并且架构搜索空间过大且冗余，这导致现有的强化学习模型无法有效地导航搜索空间。

Method: 提出一种名为HHNAS-AM的层次混合神经架构搜索方法。该方法通过基于领域知识的模板组织搜索空间，并利用基于Q学习的动态自适应变异策略加速和优化搜索过程。同时提出基于概率的探索机制以提高搜索效果。

Result: 在Spider数据集上的db_id预测任务实验中，所提出的方法在测试准确率上相较现有基线提升了8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法能够有效组织和探索搜索空间，从而发现高效的神经网络架构，为文本分类和类似任务提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了线性偏好优化（LPO），一种改进的偏好对齐框架，克服了DPO（直接偏好优化）的过拟合和崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DPO方法尽管简单稳定，但容易面临过拟合和崩溃的问题，亟需新的改进方法增强模型性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 通过用绝对差值损失替代log-sigmoid函数，引入梯度解耦以优化动态隔离。2. 利用偏移约束和正则化项，增强模型稳定性，保持响应质量。3. 运用梯度分离及可调系数，线性控制拒绝概率的下降，实现可控的拒绝抑制。

Result: 在广泛的实验中，LPO在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本到语音（TTS）任务中均表现优异，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: LPO证明是一种稳定且可调的偏好对齐新范式，并且公开了源代码、模型和训练数据，便于社区使用和验证。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统方法仅提取和转移用户表示，忽视了物品表示和用户-物品交互表示，并且在下游任务中不能很好地连接上下游模型存在的差距。

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架，综合利用基础模型中的用户表示、物品表示和交互表示，并通过非线性适配器、同构交互模块及独立检索等多粒度机制增强传输效果。

Result: LFM4Ads框架在腾讯的广告平台部署后显著提升了总体GMV 2.45%，预计年收入增长数亿美元。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads框架在工业级广告推荐中成功应用，通过全面且细化的表示转移提高了推荐效果，并具有显著的经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: 该模型具备恢复细节特征、学习大气场先验及提供像素级不确定性能力，可在大气研究和应用领域中大显身手。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to

gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence

Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Conclusion: Aura-CAPTCHA提供了一种能够优化安全性和用户可用性的新型多模态验证码方法，具备强大和可扩展性。

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible
to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了一类神经算子（NO），通过利用生成型平衡算子（GEO）解决凸优化问题的能力，展示其参数规模随着误差的减少仅呈对数增长的特点，弥合了理论和实验的差距，并通过三个实际应用验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经算子的理论分析与实际表现之间存在较大差距：理论表明需要大量参数才能解决多数算子学习问题，而实验却表明高效实现是可能的。本文旨在弥合这一差距，针对生成平衡算子（GEO）的参数效率进行研究。

Method: 本文采用生成型平衡算子（GEO）结合有限维深度平衡层，用于解决分离Hilbert空间上凸优化问题族，并利用输入为凸损失函数，输出为相应优化解的映射进行建模和分析。

Result: 研究表明，当输入损失函数位于合适的无限维紧致集时，GEO可在参数规模仅随误差倒数的对数增长的情况下，均匀近似相应解。此外，通过在非线性偏微分方程、随机最优控制问题以及流动性约束下的金融对冲问题三个应用中验证了理论结果及有效性。

Conclusion: 生成型平衡算子（GEO）不仅参数高效地解决了凸优化类问题，还在理论和实际中验证了其良好的推广性，并能支持多种实际应用。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Motivation: 现有自动分区方法在面对指数增长的可能分区选择时，容易因超出内存限制而失败，或者因为搜索空间有限而导致性能不佳。

Method: 系统结合了静态编译器分析和蒙特卡洛树搜索，分析张量维度的切分需求及分区冲突，并在此基础上构建高效决策空间。

Result: 该系统在各种硬件平台和模型架构上大幅优于现有工业方法，发现了新的更优解，并且实现了全自动化，即使针对复杂的大模型也能完成任务。

Conclusion: 新系统解决了传统方法的内存限制问题及性能瓶颈，为大规模机器学习模型的分布式切分提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种叫SEAL的解释性图神经网络，用于将模型预测归因于具体的分子子结构，从而提升可解释性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络尽管在预测分子属性方面表现出色，但其“黑箱”性质导致了可解释性问题，限制了在药物发现和材料设计等关键应用中的信任度。同时，现有的解释技术难以准确量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为SEAL的模型，其通过将输入图分解为化学相关的片段，并估计这些片段对输出的因果影响，从而实现对模型预测的归因。模型架构通过减少片段间的信息传递来实现预测与归因的强一致性。

Result: 在合成基准和现实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐的解释性方面都优于现有方法。同时，用户研究表明，SEAL为领域专家提供了更直观和可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过在预测性能和可解释性之间架起桥梁，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决梯度下降方法在参数过多和数据不足情况下的不确定性估计问题，尤其是在深度学习模型中，传统bootstrap方法应用存在局限性。

Method: 提出基于双模型并行训练的Twin-Boot方法，利用独立的bootstrap样本，结合周期性均值重置机制，在优化过程中适应性采样参数，融入不确定性估计。

Result: 在深度神经网络与复杂高维逆问题中，Twin-Boot方法提升了模型校准与泛化性能，还生成了可解释的不确定性映射。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot方法通过集成不确定性估计，使优化过程具有数据驱动的正则化特性，并提供了更可靠的模型不确定性分析。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Result: 实验结果表明，当客户端数量增加时，联邦学习方法能显著提升任何单个客户端的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 证明了联邦学习在非线性系统识别中的有效性，并展示其在真实物理系统环境中的潜力。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Conclusion: 异质性腐败在最优估计中起关键作用，新方法很好地描述了处理这种异质分布时如何达到最佳性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Result: NGN-M在步长超参数选择的稳定性更强，同时表现优于或接近现有最优优化器。

Conclusion: 本文的NGN-M优化器解决了步长选择敏感性问题，为优化算法提供了一种高性能且稳定的方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了深度网络泛化的本质，在无监督学习和理论实践之间建立新的研究方向，对解析化学习动力学提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: 本文系统性评估了稀疏自编码器（SAE）在减少语言模型中的多义性问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型中神经元的多义性（polysemanticity）使得模型难以解释。稀疏自编码器被提出以通过将稠密激活转化为稀疏特征，来提高可解释性，但其效果未经过定量对比。

Method: 本文采用Jensen-Shannon距离提出了一种细粒度的概念可分性指标，评估多个SAE变体在五个基准数据集上的表现，同时引入了两种干预策略及一种新方法APP，用于概念级控制。

Result: 结果显示SAE能够减少多义性并提升概念可分性，在局部抑制的情况下提供更精准的概念控制。但更高的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分性，且可能降低模型下游性能。APP在目标概念移除中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAE在提升语言模型解释性方面有显著潜力，但在稀疏性和性能之间需要权衡。APP作为一种新方法有助于针对性干预。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Motivation: 解决当前长上下文语言模型在计算效率和记忆管理上的挑战，提出一种模块化、输入自适应的解决方案。

Method: 设计了包含Mamba式结构状态空间模型（SSM）主干、稀疏全局注意力、片段级MoE前馈路由和双内存（工作区和事实PKM）的混合架构，并通过分阶段课程以稳定激活各部分。

Result: 通过数千万参数规模的原型实验，展示了该方法在合成数据上的实现可行性和定性扩展行为，例如长上下文处理的吞吐量交叉点及专家路由的可控性。但尚未在实际任务规模上验证其性能。

Conclusion: Hydra为设计模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型提供了蓝图，但需进一步实证研究以验证其在目标规模上的效果。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Conclusion: 目前的CETs存在严重缺陷，需发展更具鲁棒性的技术；研究提供了公开数据集、代码及评估工具，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Motivation: 通过引入范畴论和协代数模型，更高效地解决异步并行分布式强化学习中的状态值或动作值问题。

Method: 基于拓扑和协代数理论，利用范畴论工具构建强化学习新模型，异步并行分布式求解固定点，拓展了传统动态系统（如MDPs、POMDPs）模型。

Conclusion: 这项研究用高级数学抽象统一并扩展了强化学习中的算法与动态系统，为分布式并行求解问题提供了一种新的视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: 制定科学有效和可靠的实践原则，以提高DPML研究的透明性和可信性。

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

<details>

Motivation: 为了应对监狱破坏攻击中对LLM安全的威胁，需设计能消除有害知识同时保持模型语言流畅性和通用能力的方法。

Method: SafeLLM采用三阶段流程：动态不安全输出检测、基于FFN激活的词级有害内容追踪、约束优化以抑制不安全行为。结合外部分类器和内部评估以检测不安全输出，并通过优化机制实现精确控制。

Result: 实验表明SafeLLM在主流LLM和多个基准测试中显著降低了攻击成功率，并在应对新的攻击上表现更稳健，同时保留了模型的通用性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了基于遗忘机制的方法有效性，表明Unlearning是一种可扩展的、增强LLM安全性的潜在方向。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FairPrep，一个用于评估公平性数据预处理技术的模块化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在高风险决策中的应用增加，算法结果的公平性成为关注重点，尤其是数据级别的预处理方法尚未得到足够重视，缺乏标准化的评估工具。

Method: 设计了FairPrep，以AIF360为基础，支持数据集、公平性干预和预测模型的无缝集成，提供批量处理接口及公平性、效用性度量的自动报告。

Result: FairPrep通过标准化管道支持高效实验和可重复性评估，填补了公平性基准测试的空白。

Conclusion: FairPrep为数据级公平性研究提供了务实的基础，有助于推动这一领域的发展。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Motivation: TNNs虽然在高维问题中表现出色，但受频率原则的限制，无法准确捕获解的高频特性。有必要提升其对于复杂多尺度问题的表达能力。

Method: 利用傅里叶分析研究TNNs的训练动力学，并结合随机傅里叶特征以及高维函数的一维分量傅里叶变换，构建频率特征提取方法，并提出频率自适应算法。

Conclusion: 频率自适应TNNs算法显著增强了TNNs在高维多尺度问题中的应用能力，有效缓解了维度灾难的影响。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

Result: 在离线实验中实现了+0.51%的GAUC改进，在线实验中提升了2.6%的ROI。

Conclusion: MAL框架能够有效整合多种归因信号，提升转化率预测模型的性能，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保证局部最优性的前提下，更高效地生成帕累托最优解释，提升对黑箱模型的可信理解。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

Method: 结合变压器衍生嵌入方式，在知识图谱环境下评估CSG，并引入结构和语义复杂性指标进行比较分析。

Conclusion: CSG的稳定性和推广能力并不适用于链路预测任务，需开发更稳定、可解释性强且与任务一致的数据集复杂性衡量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

TL;DR: 本文探讨使用算法集体行动，通过少数群体用户重新标注数据实现机器学习模型的公平性，而无需修改公司的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习模型常常因为训练数据的偏倚而导致某些少数群体受到不公平的对待，并且现有的偏倚缓解方法往往需要组织的支持和牺牲系统性能。

Method: 提出三种实用且与模型无关的重新标注数据的方法，并在实际数据集上验证其有效性。

Result: 少数群体的子集通过重新标注数据能显著减少不公平现象，同时对整体预测误差的影响较小。

Conclusion: 用户可以在无需公司训练过程调整的情况下，通过协调重新标注数据显著提高模型的公平性。

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

TL;DR: EvoFormer是一种动态图表示学习框架，通过结构感知Transformer模块和演化敏感的时间模块，解决了结构访问偏差和突变性演化盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态图表示学习中存在结构访问偏差和对突变性演化的盲区，影响了表示学习的精确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出EvoFormer框架，引入结构感知Transformer模块及三步策略的演化敏感时间模块，分别处理结构信息和时间演化问题。

Conclusion: EvoFormer框架通过纠正结构和时间偏差，能更有效地捕捉动态图的结构演化特性，实现了高效的图表示学习。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Conclusion: CITE填补了异构TAG基准数据集的空白，并提供了丰富的实验和协议，为相关领域的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合最小二乘法/梯度下降法，用于加速DeepONet的训练，其中利用最小二乘法优化分支网络最后一层的参数，并通过梯度下降更新其他隐藏层参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进优化方法，加速DeepONet训练并提升其性能，特别是针对参数规模大、直接求解不可行的问题。

Method: 将DeepONet的输出视作分支网络最后一层参数的线性系统，采用最小二乘法解决该层参数优化问题；同时，将过大的线性系统分解为分支网络和干网络的两个较小子问题分别求解。

Result: 提出了一种能高效处理大规模线性系统的方法，同时支持带正则化项的$L^2$损失函数，并适用于无监督学习的物理约束损失。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了DeepONet模型的训练效率，展示了其广泛的适用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合泛化与个性化的混合框架，用于穿戴设备上的人类活动识别(HAR)。通过在设备端使用少样本学习进行个性化调整，并仅更新分类层，达到了高效的个性化效果，同时计算和存储开销较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类活动识别模型在面向新用户时表现有限，主要是由于用户引发的概念漂移（UICD）。因此，提出有效的个性化方法成为关键。

Method: 采用一种混合框架，首先进行跨用户泛化，然后通过少样本学习直接在设备端快速适应个人数据，仅更新分类层，以此实现高效的个性化。

Result: 在能效优化的RISC-V架构GAP9微控制器上测试该框架，并在三个多样化的HAR场景中验证：RecGym、QVAR-Gesture和Ultrasound-Gesture，分别实现了3.73%、17.38%和3.70%的精度提升。

Conclusion: 验证了快速、轻量化且有效的个性化在嵌入式平台上的可行性，为大规模、用户感知的HAR系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Motivation: 在线学习的数据流中会随着概念漂移发生动态变化，现有的方法无法有效检测重叠的聚类，尤其在在线数据流环境下效率不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的不相似性度量方法，专注于检测聚类重叠，同时减少计算复杂度，并避免正交聚类的误合并。

Result: 该方法在检测聚类重叠时显示出显著优势，其计算速度比现有方法快数倍，并成功避免了正交聚类的错误合并。

Conclusion: 新方法高效且针对性强，为在线学习数据流中的重叠聚类检测提供了一种可靠和快速的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域表现出色，但安全性问题日益突出，尤其是模型内部可能存储不安全知识。现有方法的局限性在于无法完全根除模型中不良数据的影响，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 本文提议通过在特定网络层的隐藏状态空间中实施投影变换，利用不可逆投影特性，实现不良信息的有效消除，同时保护有用知识。

Conclusion: MRP方法为模型安全性提供了一种有效的解决方案，在无效化效率和鲁棒性方面拥有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 动态分子开关不仅可模仿脑突触行为，还具备数学稳定性，为脑启发计算和稳定处理序列数据提供了理论支持，同时可以激发更广泛的物理设备模拟研究。

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证方法要么计算耗时较长，要么存在精度损失，对于大规模输入的效果不佳。提出新的方法以提高验证效率。

Method: 提出一种名为BaVerLy的验证器，通过动态构建小批次epsilon球并结合相似性计算进行联合验证。如验证失败，则通过分析结果指导进一步的细化验证。

Result: BaVerLy在MNIST和CIFAR-10上测试表明，其验证效率相比单独验证提升平均2.3倍，最高4.1倍，分析总时间从24小时减少到6小时。

Conclusion: BaVerLy有效利用神经网络的计算相似性，大幅提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，对于大规模输入集的验证尤为适用。

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Conclusion: 超曲率几何能有效捕捉分子交互的多层次及精细亲和性变化，为蛋白质-配体建模提供了有力的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: FairGuide框架能够有效改进图结构的公平性，同时能够广泛推广到多样化的下游公平性任务中。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPOF的差分隐私机制，用于多用户本地差分隐私(LDP)的训练，能在提高稳定性的同时提升隐私-效用均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于梯度的差分隐私机制在多用户场景下计算效率低和环境噪声干扰问题，同时增强隐私保护能力。

Method: 通过扰动模型训练损失函数的泰勒展开多项式近似，并向多项式系数中加入校准噪声，避免直接向梯度注入噪声，从而提升效率和稳定性。

Result: 与扩展的DP-SGD方法进行对比，在无线身体区域网络(WBAN)场景中实验表明，SPOF在重建精度上平均提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%。

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户差分隐私问题中相较传统方法表现出更优的隐私-效用平衡，同时具有更高的训练效率和对噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF

Motivation: 针对工业泵在严苛环境中的早期故障检测需求，提出高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 监测五项参数，使用双阈值标记法和注入故障信号训练随机森林、XGBoost和SVM模型进行故障分类。

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 克服现有SBI方法在处理模型误差以及推断时对测试样本批量依赖的局限性。

Method: 提出一种结合标定和基于小批量最优传输的分布对齐的端到端模型，使用条件正态流近似后验分布，从而实现高效推断而无需在推断时访问模拟器。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅能够解决现有方法的限制，还能够提供高效和更具鲁棒性的推断解决方案，在多个领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 解决现有动态主题模型和在线主题模型在长时间学习中的不足，如动态模型需处理完整数据集，在线模型缺乏长期记忆能力。

Result: 实验表明，CoNTM在主题质量和预测复杂度上都优于动态主题模型，并能在线掌握主题变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM不仅能更好地捕捉多样性主题，还能适应时序变动，弥补了现有模型的缺陷。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Motivation: 现有机器学习算法往往未能实现个体公平性，且现有方法缺乏正式的公平性保证。

Method: 提出一种框架，分为两个部分：1）公平性初始，确保模型从公平状态开始；2）保留公平性的训练算法。核心方法是使用随机响应机制以保护敏感属性，同时保持公平性保证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的模型既公平又准确，且相比基于认证训练的方法效率更高。

Conclusion: 本研究成功设计了一种高效且能正式保证个体公平性的训练框架，为机器学习公平性问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Conclusion: 社会学习对于提升AI在复杂环境中的适应能力至关重要，该研究为更智能的AI发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Result: 研究显示量子退火器对RBM训练的贡献有限，但其在生成低概率分布部分样本方面表现出潜力，并首次证明了其在缓解分类遗忘中的可行性。

Conclusion: 尽管D-Wave的性能尚未在RBM训练中表现出显著优势，但其在生成多样化样本（尤其是低概率分布样本）上的潜力可以为一些高难度机器学习应用带来机会，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo算法在带宽受限的大型语言模型训练中展示了卓越的性能和通信效率，表明稀疏化和量化在该领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Result: Intern-S1在科学领域的性能显著领先于开源模型，且在部分专业任务中超越了闭源顶尖模型，比如分子合成规划、反应条件预测和晶体热力学稳定性预测任务等。

Conclusion: Intern-S1显著缩小了开源模型与封闭模型在科学领域的差距，展示了通向通用人工智能(AGI)的重要一步。

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究希望揭示许多人工智能方法在解决不确定性问题时，共享的概率理论原则。

Result: 文章展示了如何通过基础理论构建越来越复杂的模型来解决实际问题，包括过拟合、数据稀疏性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 经典估计与现代机器学习方法实质上都是以从有噪声或偏差的观测中推断隐含成因为目标的不同表现形式，这篇文章为学生和研究者提供理论综述和实践指导。

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

TL;DR: 本文探讨生成模型中的分布外检测，并研究似然分数作为OOD检测器的表现及其在表示空间中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统的安全问题，尤其是分布外检测，仍然是AI部署的主要瓶颈。作者希望探讨常用的似然分数是否是有效的分布外检测器，并分析其在不同空间的表现差异。

Method: 作者训练了一种变分扩散模型（Variational Diffusion Model），并应用于预训练ResNet-18的表示空间，而非传统的像素空间，评估相较于OpenOOD套件中现有方法的表现。

Result: 实验证明，在表示空间中，基于似然的检测器能够取得比传统方法更优的分布外检测性能。

Conclusion: 在表示空间中使用基于似然的检测是一种可行且高效的分布外检测方法，为生成模型中的安全问题提供新的解决思路。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Motivation: 解决连续动作空间多智能体强化学习中对抗攻击的检测问题。

Method: 利用深度神经网络将智能体正常行为建模为参数化多元高斯分布，定义正常度分数，并结合双侧CUSUM程序进行实时攻击检测。

Result: 在PettingZoo基准测试中，对比多种攻击方法，方法在所有测试场景中均取得AUC-ROC分值超过0.95，表现优越。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效检测持续性对抗攻击，优于离散动作空间对应方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Motivation: 受限于AI/ML硬件加速设备的内存容量和局部性，实时跟踪系统发育成为挑战，需要开发更高效的算法。

Method: 提出了一种改进的trie构建算法，用于生成等效于现有方法的系统发育重建结果，并进行了大规模模拟验证。

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类大脑在符号性思维方面的独特能力，并通过对认知架构的模拟，发现动态绑定、多项谓词和结构映射是最小需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么人类大脑能够进行符号性推理而大多数动物不能，并理解符号性思维所需的基本大脑功能。

Method: 通过17次系统性的模拟，以认知架构的动态绑定、多项谓词和结构映射能力进行各种任务测试，没有依赖诊断特征。

Result: 结果表明动态绑定、多项谓词和结构映射是实现基本符号性思维的最小要求，并显示人类智能的泛化特性与现代机器学习的差异。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对人类大脑如何产生符号性思维的理解，并对类脑人工智能发展提供了指导。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.
