Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

### [2] [Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324)
*Satyapreet Singh Yadav,Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula,Chetan Singh Thakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物灵感的实时低功耗手势识别雷达框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种更节能、高效的实时手势识别系统，避免传统雷达管道的高内存和功耗问题。

Method: 通过24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和自定义神经形态采样器，将信号转换为稀疏尖峰表示，并采用轻量级神经网络处理事件数据。

Result: 在七名用户五种手势的数据集上实时准确率超过85%。

Conclusion: 首次引入以生物灵感为基础的异步sigma-delta编码和事件驱动框架，实现了低延迟、低功耗、无频谱图重建的雷达手势识别系统。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

### [3] [DreamVVT: Mastering Realistic Video Virtual Try-On in the Wild via a Stage-Wise Diffusion Transformer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02807)
*Tongchun Zuo,Zaiyu Huang,Shuliang Ning,Ente Lin,Chao Liang,Zerong Zheng,Jianwen Jiang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao,Xin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种名为DreamVVT的视频虚拟试穿(VVT)新技术，通过一个两阶段框架提升了服装细节的保持和时间稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法高度依赖成对数据集且难以有效利用高级视觉模型与测试输入的先验信息，难以在复杂场景中保持服装细节和时间一致性。

Method: 提出DreamVVT，两阶段方法：第一阶段利用视觉语言模型从多帧生成高保真关键帧试穿图像；第二阶段结合骨架图和细粒度运动描述，使用预训练视频生成模型生成长时间一致动态视频。

Result: 实验显示DreamVVT在服装细节保持与时间稳定性上优于现有方法，且对现实场景适应性更强。

Conclusion: DreamVVT证明了在视频虚拟试穿中，通过有效引入高级视觉模型的先验和设计精巧的架构，对于实现更高的性能和应用价值具有重要意义。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [4] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探索了图像联合嵌入预测架构(IJEPA)中归一化策略对语义区域预测的影响，并提出改进方法取得性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究了传统IJEPA模型中，特征归一化(LN)对语义信息捕捉的影响，并发现其可能破坏图像视觉tokens的能量层级。

Method: 提出用DynTanh激活函数替代特征归一化(LN)，以更好保留视觉token的自然能量分布，并促进高能量tokens在预测损失中的作用。

Result: 使用DynTanh改进的IJEPA模型在ImageNet分类精度从38%提升至42.7%，NYU Depth V2单目深度估计的均方根误差降低了0.08。

Conclusion: 保留token自然能量对实现更有效的视觉自监督表征学习至关重要，该方法有效解决了传统方法存在的缺陷。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [5] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了融合NeRF高保真渲染和GS显式结构编辑优势的混合模型GENIE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF和GS方法存在高质量渲染与可编辑性之间的权衡，需开发能平衡两者的新模型。

Method: GENIE采用高斯集合表示场景，通过训练的特征嵌入对NeRF条件化建模，并提出基于光线跟踪的快速高斯邻域搜索和多分辨哈希网格，用于实时编辑。

Result: 该方法实现了实时编辑及动态交互，画面渲染能即时响应场景调整。

Conclusion: GENIE结合隐式和显式表示的优点，在几何编辑与神经渲染之间架起桥梁，并支持与物理模拟的兼容性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code
can be found under (https://github.com/MikolajZielinski/genie)

### [6] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全依赖粗略标注的医学图像分割框架，利用过渡矩阵渐进优化分割结果，实验表明其效果优于现有弱监督方法，接近完全监督效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的像素级医学图像标注较难获得，成本高且需要医学专业知识。

Method: 提出通过引入过渡矩阵建模粗略标注中的不准确和不完整区域，并联合多组粗略标注训练网络，从而逐步优化网络输出。

Result: 在ACDC、MSCMRseg和UK Biobank数据集上验证了方法的灵活性和有效性，效果优于现有弱监督方法，并接近完全监督方式。

Conclusion: 该方法表明完全依赖粗略标注亦可实现高水平的分割性能，为弱监督语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [7] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于LiDAR的检测模拟模型MIDAR，通过微观交通仿真器提供的车辆特征，模拟真实的LiDAR检测结果，解决了高保真传感器模拟和多车场景可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实大规模无人驾驶测试难以实现，需要模拟方式提升基于合作感知的数据处理能力，但现有仿真器在高保真建模与多车规模扩展上存在矛盾。

Method: 提出MIDAR模型，通过构建精炼多跳视线遮挡图（RM-LoS），并用GRU增强的APPNP架构传播关键特征，生成高精度的LiDAR检测模拟结果。

Result: MIDAR在nuScenes数据集上的主流3D LiDAR检测模型模拟精度达到AUC 0.909，并在多种应用中验证了其对单车观测精度的重要性。

Conclusion: MIDAR解决了感知建模能力与交通模拟扩展性的矛盾，可用于多种交通应用，计划开源。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Result: 基于Transformer的模型在多种公开基准数据集上表现出了先进的目标检测性能。

Conclusion: Transformer在高分辨率遥感图像目标检测中展现了出色的能力，值得进一步探索和发展。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一种新框架，增强了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在复杂视觉引导下生成创意内容的能力，特别是在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模视觉语言模型在生成高视觉保真度、真实创意以及精确遵循用户指令的长文本时表现有限，论文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过引入一个多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，提取图像细粒度属性，结合用户指令生成优化的输入提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上，使用VisuGen Metrics（视觉关联性、创意性和指令遵循性）进行评估，VisuCraft在多个任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: VisuCraft显著提升了LVLMs在生成具创意、视觉关联和用户对齐的长文本方面的能力，为复杂创意AI应用解锁了新可能性。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型需要在正常数据上训练，限制了其在实际环境中的应用。本研究旨在解决仅有混杂数据时扩散模型的适用性问题。

Conclusion: 新方法克服了传统模型对正常数据依赖的局限性，并在无监督异常分割中达到了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解不同材料配置对室内声学特性的影响，为声学设计提供数据支持。

Method: 提出基于编码器-解码器的模型，从音视观测中提取关键属性，并生成基于材料指定的目标室内响应（RIR）。

Result: 新模型在生成高保真RIR方面效果显著，且优于多种对比模型和最新技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效编码材料信息，展示了在材料感知的RIR预测领域的应用前景。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨预训练大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在Vision-and-Language Navigation（VLN）任务中的表现，发现经过微调后，这些模型在低级和全景导航场景中的性能仍不如专门设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需大幅框架调整与专门训练的大规模视觉语言模型在VLN任务的潜力，并比较其在不同导航模式下的适用性。

Method: 微调开源的大规模视觉语言模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，在Room-to-Room（R2R）数据集上对其进行训练和性能评估，以同时适应低级与全景导航场景。

Result: 经过微调后的模型在R2R测试集上的成功率为41%，证明此类LVLMs模型可以完成基本的VLN任务。

Conclusion: 虽然无需调整架构的LVLMs显示出一定的VLN能力，但与专门设计的VLN模型相比，性能仍落后，表明未来需更深入挖掘其潜力或进行优化。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了MAP估计在盲去卷积问题中的局限性及可能的改善方式，发现需要更好的初始值来克服模糊解问题，并通过实验验证其理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MAP估计因经典稀疏性先验容易偏向模糊解，限制了其在盲去卷积问题中的效果。研究动机是希望通过新的扩散先验研究揭示局限性并提出解决方法。

Method: 采用基于扩散的先验模型，分析图像分布的似然性特点，并结合梯度下降对后验进行优化解析与实验验证。

Result: 研究发现模糊图像具有较高的似然值，而后验中局部极小值可以代表自然图像。通过理论推导与数值实验，验证了改进初始值可提高MAP性能。

Conclusion: MAP估计本身具有结构性局限，改进的关键在于通过优秀初始化引导优化至合理的局部最低点，而扩散型先验在设计和应用上有更多优化空间。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小型嵌入式设备模型在抗操作条件和模态变化方面的表现，尤其是预训练对提升鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 使用标准对象识别架构的缩放规律构建了两种超小模型，并在不同数据集上进行系统实验。

Result: 实验显示ImageNet预训练对鲁棒性有正向影响，但模型达到一定容量阈值后，效果减弱。

Conclusion: 建议仍然采用预训练，同时在条件允许下避免使用过小模型，因为虽然其在域内表现良好，但在非理想工作条件下较脆弱。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

*Chenxu Zhang,Zenan Li,Hongyi Xu,You Xie,Xiaochen Zhao,Tianpei Gu,Guoxian Song,Xin Chen,Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Linjie Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个音频驱动的肖像动画框架，可以从单一参考图像和音频生成高质量、情感丰富的说话人视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多专注于短时的嘴唇同步和视觉细节，缺乏对表演情感变化的捕捉能力，无法生成长期连贯的表演视频。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成模型：首先是音频条件的自回归扩散模型，生成标识无关的面部运动潜在编码；然后通过扩散视频合成模块将这些动作生成高保真视频。

Result: 实验显示，X-Actor生成的肖像动画在情感传达和长时表演上远超传统方法，并达到了当前的技术水平。

Conclusion: X-Actor突破了传统说话人动画的限制，能够生成类似演员表演的复杂情感肖像动画，适合各种长时音频驱动的视频生成场景。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [16] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像去噪方法，通过引入尺度等变性以提高模型在空间异质噪声条件下的泛化能力，并采用HNM和IGM组件提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像去噪模型在处理空间异质噪声等分布外噪声模式时表现不佳，存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种鲁棒的盲去噪框架，包括异质归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM），分别用于稳定特征分布并动态校正不同强度噪声下的特征，以及通过信号与特征路径的门控交互实现信息调制。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上的性能超过当前最先进方法，特别是在空间异质噪声条件下表现卓越。

Conclusion: 通过引入尺度等变性及相关模块，显著提高了图像去噪模型的分布外鲁棒性，未来研究可进一步探索代码和方法的扩展应用。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出ANSWER方法，提高扩散模型生成图像的提示依从性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在提示遵循性和质量上的一致性差异问题。

Method: 开发了无需额外资源的自适应负采样（ANSWER）程序，通过正负提示条件的结合，提高生成图像中对提示的忠实度。

Result: 实验证明，ANSWER方法在多个基准上优于现有方法，且被用户更加青睐。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种无需额外训练的技术，适用于支持CFG的任何模型，有效提升图像生成质量及提示依从性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索有效捕获领域特定信息的方法，改进现有的多领域学习中LoRA适配器的结构。

Method: 确保共享和领域特定LoRA分别位于预训练权重的列空间和左零空间。

Result: 在动作识别任务中的三个数据集上（UCF101, Kinetics400, HMDB51），验证了方法在某些情况下的有效性，并分析了LoRA权重的维度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以更有效区分共享与领域特定信息，提高多领域学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced
generalization performance. In this paper, we propose MoExDA, a lightweight
domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对对象检测的对抗性攻击方法AFOG，可同时攻击基于transformer和CNN的检测器，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理transformer检测器时表现较弱，缺乏统一的对抗攻击框架以应对不同架构的检测器。

Method: AFOG采用了可学习的注意力机制，将对抗性扰动聚焦于检测任务中容易受影响的图像区域，同时将两类特征损失整合以提高攻击效果，并通过多次注入对抗性扰动实现攻击效率和隐蔽性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上对12种大型检测transformer进行的实验显示，AFOG使基于transformer的检测器的攻击性能提高了最多83%。同时，其速度和隐藏性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效且隐蔽的统一对抗攻击方法，为对象检测领域的对抗研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为In-Generation Detection (IGD)的新方法，通过利用扩散模型生成过程中的预测噪声进行NSFW内容检测，比现有方法更直接有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NSFW检测方法主要集中于生成前的文本过滤或生成后的图像审核，而忽略了生成过程中的潜在检测机会。研究发现，扩散模型在生成过程中预测的噪声可能包含区分NSFW和普通提示的语义信息。

Method: 提出In-Generation Detection (IGD)方法，利用扩散模型生成过程中的预测噪声作为内在信号检测NSFW内容，并在七个类别的NSFW数据上进行实验验证。

Result: 在七个NSFW类别的数据上，IGD在对抗性提示和普通提示中实现了91.32%的平均检测准确率，性能优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD通过在生成过程中利用扩散模型的内在信号，提供了一种新颖且高效的NSFW内容检测方法，可显著提升检测性能并扩展了检测的时间节点。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [22] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架MGFC，通过多粒度特征校准实现对VFM特征的层次化对齐，以增强在域迁移下的鲁棒性，并在实验中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DGSS需要提高模型对未见域的泛化能力，而现有方法忽略了特征层次的适应性，这是精确密集预测的关键。

Method: 提出MGFC框架，逐步校准VFMs的粗、中、细粒度特征，从全局语义到类别层次再到空间细节，进行分层逐次对齐。

Result: MGFC在基准数据集上的实验中表现优于当前最先进的DGSS方法，有效提升了跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MGFC通过多粒度适配，将VFMs的泛化优势成功转化为DGSS任务的性能提升，验证了分层校准在语义分割中的有效性。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为SLFG的方法，通过将单独帧组合成语义一致的场景帧，有效提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力，同时引入了新的数据集LVSQA支持场景问答任务（SceneQA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在长视频理解方面表现不佳，因为处理所有视频帧及其相关信息存在资源限制，难以有效提取相关信息。

Method: 本文提出了一种场景指向的SLFG方法，通过场景定位和动态帧重组机制实现语义一致场景帧的生成，同时推出了LVSQA数据集以支持SceneQA任务。

Result: SLFG显著增强了现有MLLMs在长视频基准测试中的表现，无需修改模型架构，具备即插即用的优势。

Conclusion: SLFG在长视频理解任务上展示了卓越性能，并通过LVSQA数据集为MLLMs的场景感知能力提供了更加公正的评价方案。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

*Liheng Zhang,Weihao Yu,Zubo Lu,Haozhi Gu,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SA-3DGS的新方法，通过重要性评分识别低重要性的高斯点，从而实现高效的高斯剪枝和压缩。在多个数据集上，达到了最高66倍的压缩率，同时保持或提高了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯方法在新视图合成方面表现出色，但需要大量高斯点表示场景，导致存储需求高，限制实际应用。最新的方法难以高效识别无关高斯点，影响剪枝、压缩效果和渲染性能。

Method: SA-3DGS将学习的重要性评分用于自动识别场景中的低重要性高斯点，实现有效剪枝和冗余减少；通过重要性感知聚类模块将高斯属性更准确地压缩到码本中；并通过码本修复模块恢复原始高斯点属性，缓解信息丢失造成的渲染质量下降。

Result: 实验表明，SA-3DGS在多个基准数据集上实现了最高66倍的压缩，同时保持甚至提升了渲染质量；此外，提升了其他基于剪枝方法（如LightGaussian）的表现。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS显著降低了存储成本，同时保持了优异的渲染质量，展示了良好的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法难以捕捉细腻面部动态和维持时序身份一致性的问题。

Method: 基于Diffusion Transformer (DiT)骨干网络，加入一种混合跨注意力机制，同时引入分层时序池化和时序感知跨注意力专家模块，并结合潜在视频感知损失进行训练。

Result: 在CelebIPVid数据集上的实验表明，MoCA方法在面部相似性方面相较现有方法提升超过5%。

Conclusion: MoCA通过创新设计显著提升了文本到视频生成中的身份一致性和微观细节捕捉能力。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Result: 在新开发的CrossVideoQA数据集中，VideoForest框架在人物识别、行为分析和摘要推理任务中表现显著优越，分别达到71.93%、83.75%和51.67%的准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本研究通过强调以人水平特征为核心的跨视频理解方法，提出了一种既能合并多视频流又能进行高效推理的新范式，同时维持了计算效率。

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MIT数据集以及CovOG基线模型为后续多人人类对话视频生成研究提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出FaceMat，一个无需辅助输入即可预测高质量阿尔法遮罩的新框架，用于复杂场景下的面部遮罩分割，该方法在多个基准测试中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的面部滤镜在面对遮挡物（如手、头发或配饰）时表现较差，因此需要开发能够处理复杂遮挡情况下的面部分割技术。

Method: 通过两阶段训练管道，教师模型基于负对数似然损失联合估计阿尔法遮罩及像素级不确定性，学生模型通过空间自适应知识蒸馏聚焦模糊或被遮挡区域。此外，重新定义遮罩目标，将皮肤作为前景，遮挡物作为背景。构建了名为CelebAMat的大规模合成数据集。

Result: 实验表明，FaceMat在多个基准测试中超越了当前技术水平，并增强了面部滤镜在现实视频场景中的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat框架有效提升了面部遮罩分割的性能，对于复杂场景下的实时视频增强应用具有重要意义，代码及数据集已公开。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过分依赖显式特征对齐，削弱了模态的独特优势和互补性，需通过新方式实现跨模态协作。

Method: 引入了互感单元(MPU)实现隐式跨模态交互对齐，并采用双路径策略分别进行模态融合学习和单一模态优化。

Result: 在多数据集和模型主干上，CHARM模型在表现脆弱的模态下表现尤为突出，整体优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过从模态同质化转向和谐化，本研究实现了跨模态的互补性和多样性统一。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种新框架CORE-ReID，用于解决人员再识别的无监督领域适应问题，采用CycleGAN生成多样数据，并通过整合多视角特征和学习融合组件显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督领域适应下人员再识别中的跨摄像头图像特性差异和伪标签歧义问题。

Method: 引入CycleGAN生成一致化数据，用教师-学生网络进行多层次聚类和伪标签生成，设计可学习融合模块利用局部特征优化全局特征的学习。

Result: 在三种主流无监督领域适应数据集上的性能明显优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: CORE-ReID框架通过多层次特征优化与高效组件增强克服多域问题，在精准度方面表现卓越，是领域适应任务中的先进解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSF-Mamba的网络模型，结合空间和频率域特征用于3D医学图像分割，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D医学图像分割在建模全局上下文时受到以空间域为主的局限，而频率域表示未被充分利用。

Method: 通过双分支架构，从空间和频率域提取特征，并利用Mamba模块进行特征融合，同时设计3D多方向扫描机制加强局部和全局线索的融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多种指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSF-Mamba通过结合空间和频率域特征，有效解决了局部和全局信息建模的问题，为3D医学图像分割开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个称为RobustGS的模块，旨在提升现有3DGS方法在各种恶劣成像环境下的鲁棒性，从而实现高质量的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前馈式3DGS假设输入多视角图像是高质量的，但在现实情况下图像通常带有噪声、低光照或雨等问题，导致重建结果质量下降。本文通过增强多视角特征模块来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一个通用高效的多视角特征增强模块RobustGS，可无缝集成到现有预训练流程中。引入了通用降解学习组件和一个新的语义感知状态空间模型，分别用于提取多种降解的特征表示以及改进特征空间的输入和跨视角相似信息的语义聚合。

Result: 实验表明，在各种类型降解环境下，本文方法以即插即用的方式集成到现有方法中后，可一致地实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS能够有效提高前馈式3DGS方法在恶劣成像条件下的重建鲁棒性，并且具有简单易用的优势。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在种族和性别等人口统计学属性上，忽视了更广泛属性的公平性问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型(LLMs)构建开放集偏见属性知识库，并评估LVLMs在更细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: LVLMs在多样化属性上显示出偏见，且文化、环境和行为因素比传统人口统计学属性对其决策影响更大。

Conclusion: 需要对LVLMs的公平性进行更广泛的探讨和优化，以减少多样属性上的偏见。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Motivation: 目前的伪包增强方法在实例采样上缺乏多样性，导致模型性能受限，特别是在测试时遇到肿瘤区域较小的全视野切片时。

Method: 提出了一种对比跨包增强方法$C^2Aug$，从相同类别的所有包中采样实例，增强伪包的多样性。此外，使用基于包级和组级的对比学习框架，提升不同语义特征的区分能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，$C^2Aug$ 在多个评价指标上均优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$ 方法在增强伪包多样性的同时，针对小肿瘤区域情况提供了有效解决方案，提高了模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有方法中仅使用简单模板忽略丰富语义信息的问题，增强医学图像分类系统适应动态临床环境的能力。

Method: 通过大语言模型生成视觉概念，并使用相似性过滤动态构建视觉概念池；然后利用跨模态图像-概念注意模块和注意力损失，将这些概念融入持续学习过程。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到最新的性能水平（state-of-the-art）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在提升持续学习能力和分类性能上具有显著优势，并将公开代码以供研究使用。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

TL;DR: AVATAR是一种解决长时间跨度视频多模态推理挑战的方法，通过两项核心组件提升了样本效率和关键推理步骤的学习效果，在多个基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时间跨度视频多模态推理中存在的数据效率低、优势消失和均一信用分配问题。

Method: 提出AVATAR框架，包括（1）提高样本效率的离策略训练架构和（2）新的信用分配策略TAS，用于关键推理阶段的权重提升。

Result: AVATAR在MMVU、OmniBench和Video-Holmes等基准测试中表现优于Qwen2.5-Omni，并提高了超过35%的样本效率。

Conclusion: AVATAR通过创新方法显著提升了多模态推理的性能和效率，证明了其在长时间跨度视频推理任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)，利用独立成分分析（ICA）对从CLIP提取的视觉特征进行显式解缠，提升了小样本学习的表现并减少了过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小样本学习中，现有方法通常依赖缠绕的表示来进行模型适配，这在监督数据有限的背景下会显著影响适配效果。而理论研究表明，多模态对比学习能够实现线性可分性的潜在表示，并为解除表示缠绕提供了途径。

Method: 提出了CCA框架，将CLIP的视觉特征通过无监督独立成分分析（ICA）进行解缠，同时通过一维和双向方法增强CLIP原有的跨模态对齐能力，并结合跨模态分类输出以提升准确性。

Result: 实验在11个基准数据集上表明，CCA在小样本表现和对分布变化的鲁棒性上优于现有方法，同时具备更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: CCA提供了一种有效的小样本学习解决方案，通过显式解缠和跨模态增强，实现了稳定的性能和更少的训练需求。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Method: 提出了一个名为H3R的混合框架，包括体素潜在融合和基于Plücker坐标的相机感知Transformer模块，结合两种方法优势以优化几何一致性和特征聚合。

Result: 方法实现了更快的收敛速度（比现有方法快2倍）并在RealEstate10K, ACID, 和DTU数据集上分别提升PSNR值0.59 dB、1.06 dB和0.22 dB。

Conclusion: H3R方法不仅适应可变数目及高分辨率输入视图，还展示了优秀的跨数据集泛化能力，达到了当前状态的技术水平。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究的大部分数据集偏向短期、高分辨率影像，忽略了低分辨率、多卫星、长期档案的研究需求。为解决这一问题，该研究提出了新的数据集Landsat30-AU，以填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 该数据集由30米分辨率的卫星数据组成，包括196,262个图像-文本对和17,725个人工验证的视觉问答样本，通过通用VLM和迭代验证来进行构建和优化。

Result: 研究表明，现有视觉语言模型在分析卫星影像时表现较差，但通过对特定模型进行轻量级微调后，领域相关性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU数据集为全球监测提供了一个新范式，同时也揭示了现有VLM模型在卫星影像方面的局限性，为未来的改进方向提供了基础。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的实时姿态估计方法在空间硬件限制下表现并不理想，同时传统和数据驱动的方法都难以应对强遮挡引起的阴影对姿态估计的影响。

Method: 提出了COFFEE框架，通过利用太阳相位角信息，结合稀疏神经网络和基于注意力机制的图神经网络，对阴影不敏感的显著特征进行匹配，从而实现准确的姿态估计。

Conclusion: COFFEE验证了高效且准确的未知物体姿态估计可行性，为处理复杂空间场景的空间任务提供了可靠途径。

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

*Yanshu Wang,Xichen Xu,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARD 提出了一种新型基于扩散的方法，用以生成具备真实感且空间精确的工业异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在生成复杂缺陷模式时表现出色，但在空间可控性和区域细节保真度方面存在问题。

Method: 提出了SARD，包括区域约束扩散（RCD）和判别掩码引导（DMG）两个模块，分别用于背景保持和前景缺陷区域更新，以及结合全局真实感与局部异常保真度进行评估。

Result: 在MVTec-AD 和 BTAD 数据集上，SARD 在分割精度及视觉质量方面超过现有方法，达到新的行业最优水平。

Conclusion: SARD 显著提升了像素级异常合成的性能，为工业异常检测系统的稳健性提供了支持。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Motivation: 针对现有基于流模型反演方法存在的语义偏差问题，特别是在源目标语义差异较大的情况下编辑失败的现象。

Method: 提出了一种无需进行架构修改或模型微调的训练无关方法LORE，通过直接优化反演噪声，实现更好的通用性和可控性。

Result: 在PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit三个具有挑战性的基准上均表现优异，相较于基线方法在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LORE通过潜空间优化有效解决了语义对齐和概念替换的挑战，展示了其适用于通用图像编辑任务的潜力。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ChartCap，一个包含565K真实世界图表及其详细标题的大规模数据集，用以生成更加准确无误和信息丰富的图表标题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表数据集存在无关信息过多以及未能充分体现结构和关键要点的不足，因此需要一个高质量的数据集支持模型生成更优质的图表标题。

Method: 设计了一个四阶段的管道来生成标题，仅使用图表可见数据，并采用基于循环一致性的人类验证方法来加速质量检查。同时，提出了Visual Consistency Score这一新指标以评估标题质量，通过恢复对比图表的相似性进行测量。

Result: 实验显示，用ChartCap微调的模型生成了更准确、信息丰富且减少了幻觉的图表标题，表现优于开源、商业模型及人工注释标题。

Conclusion: ChartCap和Visual Consistency Score为图表标题生成设立了新的质量基准，为相关任务的发展提供了强有力的支持。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中，风格化图像比摄影图像更易引发幻觉这一现象，并提出了一种新的机制SAVER来应对这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在理解复杂视觉文本环境方面取得了重大突破，但其幻觉问题仍限制了其实际应用，尤其是在风格化图像场景中（如游戏场景理解、艺术教育和医学分析）。

Method: 提出了一种名为SAVER（Style-Aware Visual Early Revision）的新机制，通过利用早期层反馈来修正LVLMs对风格化图像的幻觉问题。同时，构建了一个包含摄影图像及其风格化版本的数据集，并对13种先进LVLMs进行了对比实验。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更易引发幻觉，而SAVER在多个模型、数据集和任务中实现了最先进的幻觉缓解性能。

Conclusion: SAVER机制有效地减少了风格化图像引发的幻觉问题，为LVLMs在关键场景中的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Result: 提出的方法在多种真实数据集中测试，证明其对多尺度视图和大规模环境的鲁棒性，比现有方法速度提高了1.5到4倍，同时大幅减少了redis排序开销。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS通过创新的渲染框架和技术实现了高效且高质量的3D渲染，在资源有限环境下提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上实验，方法性能优越，验证了所提组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 方法结合局部与全局线索，提高了深度估计的准确性，且对已有技术有明显改进。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 的持续面部伪造检测框架，旨在解决在学习新伪造类型时常见的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有面部伪造检测方法在应对不断演变的新伪造技术时，容易在学习新任务的同时忘记旧任务。这种灾难性遗忘需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了KAN-CFD框架，包括Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) 和特征分离策略FS-KDCP。前者允许高维图像输入并维持局部性，后者通过不依赖于先前任务数据的策略避免特征空间重叠。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在性能和降低遗忘方面表现优越。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD框架为持续面部伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案，在面对新伪造方法时能保持较好的检测性能，并显著减少灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Motivation: 解决CNV形状不规则、投影伪影、噪音以及边界模糊等成像难题，并减少因缺乏公开数据集对CNV研究的限制。

Method: 提出MTG-Net网络，包含多任务框架和两个图卷积交互模块（MIGR和MRGR），通过图机制探索语义与几何双重约束，同时设计了不确定性加权损失函数以减轻伪影带来的影响。

Result: MTG-Net在分割实验中表现优异，区域分割Dice得分为87.21%，血管分割为88.12%。

Conclusion: MTG-Net有效整合了区域及血管形态学信息，克服OCTA成像挑战，可为湿性AMD的临床评估提供支撑。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Result: 实验证明AlignCAT在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准数据集上优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT显著提升弱监督视觉定位任务的性能，并解决了类别和属性上的对齐问题。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC)的新方法，用于开放词汇的人物-物体交互检测，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOI检测方法难以在视觉-语言模型中达到区域层面上的精细交互检测，同时对视觉描述的文本编码能力不足。

Method: 提出动态生成交互感知提示，并通过语言模型引导的概念校准方法，结合负采样策略提升模型对不同交互概念的区分能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，INP-CC在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC方法通过提高交互检测精度以及概念区分能力，为开放词汇HOI检测提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoShield，一个创新对抗框架，用以保护视觉语言模型（VLMs）推断用户位置的地理隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着像GPT-4o这样的视觉语言模型能够从公开的共享图像推断用户位置，地理隐私保护变得越来越重要。现有方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不理想，甚至可能引入不相关的语义内容。

Method: GeoShield包含三个关键模块：地理信息与非地理信息分离模块、地理暴露区域识别模块、以及基于分辨率的规模自适应优化模块，从全局和局部层面对扰动进行联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，GeoShield在黑盒环境下显著优于现有方法，以最小的视觉或语义质量影响实现强大的隐私保护。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个针对高级视觉语言模型位置推断的对抗扰动防御研究，为日益严重的隐私问题提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成视频时间一致性较差，为了解决这一问题，并克服FreeInit方法计算成本高昂的限制。

Result: 实验显示，FastInit不仅提高生成视频的质量和时间一致性，还显著提升了生成速度。

Conclusion: FastInit提供了一种高效、实用的视频生成解决方案，并在推理阶段显著减少计算成本，源码和数据集也将在公开使用。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了UAA的效果，证明其无需训练时在线生成对抗例也能达到数据增强方法的最新技术水准。

Conclusion: UAA是一种插件式、高效的数据增强框架，为构建鲁棒模型提供了实用可行的方法。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

*Shanshan Guo,Xiwen Liang,Junfan Lin,Yuzheng Zhuang,Liang Lin,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的机器人操作框架ActionSink，通过引入动作光流和集成功能，提升低级动作估计的精度，并在LIBERO基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在语言引导的机器人操作中，多关注高层感知和规划，而低级动作估计精度低成为主要限制因素，因此需要一种解决方案以提升动作估计性能。

Method: 提出了ActionSink框架，包括两个主要模块：1）粗到精的动作光流匹配器，通过迭代检索和去噪，逐步提升动作光流的精度；2）动态动作光流整合器，利用工作记忆池动态管理历史动作光流并通过多层融合模块进行整合和动作估计，从而提升精度。

Result: ActionSink在LIBERO基准测试中取得了7.9%的成功率提高，并在LIBERO-Long这一长时间视觉任务中提升了近8%的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入自监督动作光流和动态融合机制，ActionSink有效解决了低级动作估计精度低的问题，为基于学习的机器人操作提供了更加精准的动作估计。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

*Hongyu Shen,Junfeng Ni,Yixin Chen,Weishuo Li,Mingtao Pei,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT)的方法，解决了从2D分割提升至3D时的不一致性和边界噪声问题，通过引入实例权重矩阵和自适应密度控制机制，显著提升了分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从2D分割提升为3D的过程中，因2D分割的不一致性及边界噪声问题，导致学习的3D Gaussians存在缺陷，急需一种改进策略。

Method: 通过引入Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT)，建立实例权重矩阵用于修正2D分割不一致性，并设计GIT引导的自适应密度控制机制，对Gaussians进行分裂和裁剪，提升分割精度和清晰度。

Result: 实验结果证明，该方法不仅能够提取干净的3D资产，还在在线和离线3D分割中取得显著改进，适用于分层分割、对象提取及场景编辑等应用场景。

Conclusion: GIT方法有效解决了2D到3D分割的主要问题，显著优化了分割边界的一致性及效果，对3D资产创建及多种下游应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FFHQ-Makeup，一个由18K身份和5种化妆风格组成的高质量化妆数据集，总计生成90K对裸脸与化妆脸图像对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前化妆数据集的采集受限于大规模配对图像的收集难度，而现有合成方法要么牺牲真实性，要么在裸脸与化妆脸间造成不一致。研究目的在于构建一个高质量的配对化妆数据集，用于美容相关任务。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，提出改进的化妆迁移方法，将身份特征和化妆特征分离，保留面部一致性，将真实化妆风格迁移到图像中。

Result: 成功生成了包含18K身份和5种化妆风格的高质量多样化化妆数据集，合计90K张配对裸脸与化妆脸图像。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门致力于构建高质量化妆数据集的工作，为美容相关任务提供了重要资源，并有助于填补配对化妆数据集不足的空白。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

*Lukas Ranftl,Felix Brendel,Bertram Drost,Carsten Steger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MVTOP的新型基于Transformer的多视图刚体目标姿态估计方法，利用多视图特征早期融合解决姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单视图或使用后处理时无法解决的姿态模糊问题中表现有限，且需要一种高效的多视图方法。

Method: MVTOP采用早期融合多视图特征，通过从各相机中心发出的视线建模多视图几何关系，在已知相机内部和相对定向的前提下预测正确姿态。

Result: 方法在合成数据集上优于单视图与其他现有多视图方法，并在YCB-V数据集上取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: MVTOP是首个能够可靠解决多视图姿态模糊问题的整体方法，无需额外数据且支持端到端训练。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Result: 在多个数据集上实现竞争性超分辨率表现，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: 方法设计轻量化，可嵌入事件相机中或用作下游视觉任务的高效预处理模块。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为视觉语言模型（VLMs）设计的重要性感知后训练量化（PTQ）框架——VLMQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前现有的基于Hessian的LLM PTQ方法未能针对VLM的模态差异进行优化，造成显著性能下降。

Method: VLMQ通过引入重要性感知目标函数，优化量化过程，并通过理论指导的轻量级计算高效确定令牌重要性权重。

Result: 在0.5B到32B规模的VLMs上，跨越8个基准测试，VLMQ在低比特率下表现出卓越的性能，例如在2位量化时，MME-RealWorld上提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ有效解决了视觉令牌冗余问题，在视觉语言模型的低比特量化上实现了SOTA表现。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RSDNet，一种基于DDPMs的新型单阶段稀疏3D目标检测网络，通过引入可拆卸潜在框架(DLF)实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于DDPM的3D目标检测方法往往需要多步骤推理，效率有限，本研究旨在通过改进这一问题提升检测性能和效率。

Method: RSDNet通过在潜在特征空间中学习去噪过程，结合多层去噪自动编码器，并且在DDPMs的噪声和去噪机制上进行了重构以增强鲁棒性。此外，引入了语义几何条件指导以改善稀疏表示问题，设计了可拆卸的去噪网络以实现单次推理。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，RSDNet表现出色，超越了目前的先进方法，达到了最先进的检测结果。

Conclusion: RSDNet不仅具备鲁棒性和高效性，同时显著提高了3D目标检测的性能，是当前领域的先进标杆。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Motivation: 针对文本生成视频模型(T2V)在资源有限环境中的高计算成本，解决现有蒸馏方法依赖有监督微调(SFT)而导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出ReDPO方法，结合DPO指导模型专注恢复目标属性和SFT提升总体性能；并提出V.I.P.框架，用于过滤优化高质量数据对，并采用分步在线校准训练。

Result: 在VideoCrafter2和AnimateDiff模型上分别实现36.2%和67.5%的参数减少，同时保持甚至超越原模型性能。

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架在实现高效和高质量视频生成方面展示了显著效果，证明其在降低计算成本同时保持性能的潜力。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

Conclusion: DrUM解决了现有个性化生成方法的局限性，以有效的方式与主流T2I基础模型结合，提供准确而自然的个性化生成。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注于孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要处理单词之间的关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），生成整行文本更加全面但富有挑战性。

Method: 引入DiffBrush模型，通过内容解耦的样式学习（使用列与行掩蔽分离样式与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词辨别器确保内容一致性）实现改进。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在样式复制与内容保留方面表现出色，能够生成高质量文本行。

Conclusion: DiffBrush在手写文本行生成领域展现了优越能力，为更复杂的文本生成任务提供了应用可能性。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过联系动作与对象的语义关系和上下文信息，提升了第一人称动作识别的表现，展现了优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: EmmPD框架提升了胎盘疾病的诊断效率和准确性，为复杂病理图像分析提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Result: 分段计算相似度在非模板 memes 的匹配中表现优于全图计算等传统方法。大规模多模态语言模型在匹配任务上展现了一定潜力但仍需改进。

Conclusion: 有效地通过共享视觉元素匹配 memes 仍是一个未完全解决的挑战，需要更复杂的匹配技术。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法因传感器数据稀疏和缺乏非平坦地形的运动数据集，在姿势估计精度上存在不足，且主要限于平坦地形。

Method: 提出BaroPoser，将智能手机与智能手表的IMU与气压计数据相结合，利用气压读数估计传感器高度变化，同时采用局部大腿坐标框架进行姿势表示学习。

Conclusion: BaroPoser有效利用气压计数据提升了非平坦地形上的姿势估计和全局翻译能力，实现了实用性与精度的提升。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归扩散模型虽然擅长视频生成，但在长时间生成中因误差累积会出现时间漂移且无法并行化。

Method: 提出MMPL框架，通过“微观规划”和“宏观规划”两个阶段来构建全局故事线，并用自适应工作负载调度优化并行性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL在长视频生成中实现了高效的并行化，并解决了自回归模型在长时间生成中的不足。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双阶段方法，通过RFGM模块改善频域照明和Mamba模块增强纹理结构，对极暗图像进行细节恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在极暗图像中保留细腻细节和清晰边缘，影响文本和边缘检测等应用效果。

Method: 采用双阶段方法：第一阶段RFGM模块在频域恢复全局照明；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba模块分别增强细粒度细节和高梯度区域的边界。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游任务上，方法显著提升了细节恢复性能，同时保持轻量高效。

Conclusion: 提出的模块效率高且易于整合，可显著提升现有Fourier框架的性能，代码公开可用。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应帧修剪方法（AFP），通过优化视频帧的选择和语义图结构，大幅减少视频问答任务中帧和输入token的数量，同时提高效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在视频问答任务中的性能受限于处理大量视频帧的高昂代价，并且存在过多帧导致上下文稀释的问题，而现有关键帧选择方法仍然存在时间冗余问题。

Method: 提出自适应帧修剪（AFP）方法，通过ResNet-50和CLIP融合的特征空间进行自适应分层聚类，识别并合并视觉回声，并引入轻量的基于文本的语义图以补充信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准测试中，AFP方法实现帧数量减少86.9%和输入token减少83.2%，在提高效率的同时，也常常在准确性上超过以更多帧为基础的基线方法。

Conclusion: AFP通过智能帧选择和语义补充方法，显著提升视频问答的效率和准确性，为多模态研究提供了新的技术思路。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CIVQLLIE的框架，通过因果推理中的离散表示学习方法来增强低光图像的亮度和清晰度，同时保存高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前低光图像增强技术在极暗条件下表现不佳，或者缺乏解释性，或者依赖简化假设难以应对复杂场景。

Method: 该方法通过向量量化(VQ)将连续图像特征映射到离散的视觉代码库，并设计了多级因果干预机制，包括像素级因果干预（PCI）、特征级因果干预（FCI）结合低频选择性注意门（LSAG）以及高频细节重建模块（HDRM）。

Result: 该方法在低光环境下实现了更好的亮度和颜色恢复，同时能够对图像中的细节进行高质量还原。

Conclusion: 提出的CIVQLLIE框架有效解决了低光图像增强中因复杂场景带来的分布偏移问题，大幅提升了算法鲁棒性和输出质量。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo是一种基于小波的多频特征提取框架，用于改善文本与3D运动之间的对齐，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以匹配文本与3D运动的语义，因为它们忽视了人体复杂的空间与时序动态特性，采用的编码方式不能区分身体部位的动态差异，限制了语义对齐的精确性。

Method: 提出WaMo框架，其中包括轨迹小波分解以分离运动信号的频率成分、轨迹小波重建以还原关节轨迹，以及无序运动序列预测以增强时间一致性学习。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo分别提升了17.0%和18.2%的Rsum分数，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: WaMo框架成功实现了细粒度的文本与3D运动对齐，通过捕捉部位特异和时间动态的运动特征，展示了其卓越的表现。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型规模增长，联邦学习对客户端计算资源需求增加，难以部署在资源有限的设备上，亟需一种高效方法解决此问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：服务器端进行知识蒸馏，将大型模型表征对齐至紧凑模型；紧凑模型部署到客户端，通过学习分类器进行本地优化，并聚合返回基础模型实现个性化适配。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准上表现优异，相比现有方法在资源受限的场景下有更佳表现。

Conclusion: FedPromo在多领域学习中实现了性能、隐私和资源效率的平衡，且能适应客户端的有限计算能力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Conclusion: DOD方法展示了卓越的图像复原能力，实现单步高效采样的同时提升了结构与纹理细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

Method: 提出GRASP框架，利用现有的解剖学分割模型，通过伪标签整合和特征对齐强化病理分割模型，而无需重新训练解剖学组件。

Result: 在两套PET/CT数据集上的实验表明，GRASP在多个评估指标和不同架构上表现优异。

Conclusion: GRASP通过伪标签输入和基于transformer的解剖特征融合，成功将解剖学上下文引入病理分割，展现卓越性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Motivation: 现有步态识别方法在面对新数据集时需要重新训练，然而训练后的模型往往难以保留之前数据集的知识，导致性能下降。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了GaitAdapter方法，包括GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) 模块，通过图神经网络整合步态模式，并使用欧几里得距离稳定性方法(EDSN)调节不同任务间样本的区分性。

Result: GaitAdapter在保留多任务步态知识方面表现出色，与现有方法相比在区分能力上有显著提升。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter能够有效解决连续步态识别中知识保留与特征区分的问题，为步态识别领域带来新的可能性。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

TL;DR: 提出了NAVIA，以在保持TTA适应能力的同时减少推理延迟，可降低20%以上的延迟，并提升性能超过2.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法计算开销大，不适用于资源有限的场景，需要在减少推理成本的同时保持TTA适应能力。

Method: 提出NAVIA，通过信息增强中和Token聚合的缺失，引入[CLS] Token嵌入增强和自适应偏差，优化于熵最小化。

Result: NAVIA显著优于当前方法，在多个分布外基准测试中提升性能超过2.5%，推理延迟减少20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决TTA计算成本高的问题，显著提升效率和分布偏移适应能力。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了DepthGait框架，通过结合RGB导出的深度图与轮廓实现增强型步态识别，显著提升了性能和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的步态识别方法主要依赖二值轮廓和骨架等2D表示，难以捕捉视角变化和步态中的细节特征。因此，需要采用新的方法提供更多判别信息。

Method: 提出DepthGait框架：引入RGB图像序列生成的深度图作为新模态，与传统的二维轮廓结合。此外，设计了一种新颖的多尺度与跨层次融合方法，解决深度图与轮廓之间的模态鸿沟。

Result: 在标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，DepthGait与同类方法相比表现优越，并在多个具有挑战性的数据集上取得了出色的Rank-1均值准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait框架利用深度图增强步态识别能力，验证了其在复杂场景下实现高性能的可行性和重要性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了SCFlow框架，通过可逆的风格与内容合并来实现自然的解耦，从而避免显式地分离风格和内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式地分离视觉模型中的风格和内容具有挑战性，主要因为语义的重叠以及人类感知的主观性。当前的方法面临分离复杂概念的模糊性问题，因此本研究提出一种无需显式解耦的新思路。

Method: 提出SCFlow框架，通过flow-matching来学习关联紧密的风格与内容的双向映射，而无需显式监督解耦。该方法通过设计一个模拟解耦的数据集，并避免传统方法中对高斯分布约束的依赖，为风格和内容提供可逆解耦。

Result: SCFlow在合成的样本数据集上表现良好，同时在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt等数据集的零样本条件下也能很好地泛化，并取得具有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 通过复用风格与内容的可逆合并，SCFlow实现了自然的解耦，为可控生成任务提供了新的解决方案，同时展现了其在主流视觉任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分解问题中的端元提取和丰度估计，以提高解混精度。

Method: 基于多层矩阵分解模型，结合全变差约束邻近的空间相似性，并使用L1/2-范数稀疏约束丰度矩阵，通过交替方向乘子法（ADMM）优化模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，与其他算法相比，STVMLU方法具有更优的性能。

Conclusion: STVMLU在高光谱图像解混中的准确性和性能得到了有效提升。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

TL;DR: MACT 是一种通过多代理合作和测试时扩展来改进视觉文档理解和视觉问答问题性能的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在面对长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务时表现不佳，且自我修正能力有限，需要改进任务性能。

Method: 提出 MACT 框架，由四个小规模代理（计划、执行、评判和回答代理）组成，通过混合奖励建模和代理测试时扩展策略提高性能。

Result: MACT 在多项基准任务中表现优异，尤其是在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现突出，在15个基准测试中13个排名领先。

Conclusion: MACT 通过共同合作和灵活扩展以更小的参数规模实现了高效性能，既适合一般视觉任务也适应文档相关的复杂任务。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频分割由于缺乏监督信号和场景的复杂性，是一个具有挑战性的任务，当前方法依赖大型神经网络，计算代价高昂。

Method: 提出一种知识蒸馏框架SlotMatch，通过余弦相似性对齐教师和学生模型的槽，无需额外的蒸馏目标或辅助监督。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，基于SlotMatch的学生模型在性能上与教师模型匹配甚至超越，同时参数减少3.6倍，运行速度提高1.9倍。

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架既简单高效，又能在无监督视频分割任务中取得优异表现，优于当前的最先进方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Fd-CycleGAN，这是一种增强潜在表示学习的图像到图像翻译框架，通过捕捉局部像素语义和保持结构一致性，实现更逼真的图像翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在改进CycleGAN的图像翻译效果，特别是在提高感知质量、收敛速度和模式多样性方面，即使在数据较少的情况下。

Method: 在CycleGAN的基础上，引入局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，并采用基于分布的损失度量如KL/JS散度和对数相似性量化真实和生成图像的分布对齐，从时域和频域两方面进行强化。

Result: 通过在多个基准数据集上实验，包括Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo和合成扩展的Strike-off数据集，与基线模型CycleGAN及其他最新方法相比，Fd-CycleGAN在视觉质量、收敛速度和模式多样性上表现更优。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过结合局部和全局分布特性捕捉，实现了更一致的图像翻译效果，展示了其在图像翻译相关任务中的潜力，特别是在文档恢复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等应用中的表现优异。同时，其相较于扩散模型，具有更高的训练效率和质优输出优势。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

Conclusion: IMAC框架能够有效对齐跨领域EEG信号差异，提高分类精度和鲁棒性，是应对跨域EEG信号分类挑战的有力方法。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出医学图像分析领域的首个FM（Foundation Models）基础的冷启动主动学习（CSAL）基准测试MedCAL-Bench，评估了14个FM和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CSAL方法在目标数据集上依靠自监督学习（SSL）进行特征提取，但由于特征表示不足，效率低下。最近预训练的基础模型展示了较强的特征提取能力，可能改进CSAL方法，但目前缺乏相关基准测试。

Method: 作者构建了MedCAL-Bench基准，涵盖7个数据集中的分类和分割任务，系统比较14个FMs和7种CSAL策略，并评估它们在特征提取与样本选择阶段的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，大多数FMs对CSAL有效，DINO系列在分割任务中表现最佳；FMs在分割任务中的性能差异较大，而在分类任务中较小；在不同数据集上，不同的样本选择策略适用性不同，例如ALPS在分割中表现最佳，而RepDiv更适用于分类任务。

Conclusion: 本文验证了FMs在CSAL领域的潜力，为提高医学图像分析中标注效率与模型表现提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究表明，在快速流生成模型中，分步引导的自适应调整方法对于充分发挥其潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Conclusion: 通过动态合成提示和语义特征建模，CoPS在零样本异常检测中有效缓解了现有方法的局限性，实现了性能的新突破。

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个双摄像头框架，通过同步捕捉的聚焦（高质量纹理但有摩尔纹）和失焦（减少摩尔纹但模糊）视频解决摩尔纹去除问题，大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双摄像头方案能够高效区分摩尔纹和真实纹理，同时在保持色调和时间一致性的情况下移除摩尔纹，展示了优于现有方法的效果。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Motivation: 早期发现结直肠癌息肉至关重要，动态结肠镜视频比静态图像提供了更丰富信息。然而，动态视频中的快速相机运动会带来背景噪声，增加误报风险。

Method: 提出了AVPDN框架，包括AFIA模块和SACI模块。AFIA通过三分支架构增强特征表示，利用密集和稀疏自注意力及通道混洗操作促进信息交互；SACI利用不同感受野的膨胀卷积强化多尺度特征整合，提高模型抗噪能力。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的公开基准上测试，证明了所提方法在视频化息肉检测任务中的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AVPDN框架成功解决了动态结肠镜视频中的检测挑战，展现出卓越的多尺度息肉检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Motivation: 解决LVLMs在推理过程中视觉与语言融合导致的幻觉问题，尤其是序列长度增加引起的长时偏差。

Method: 通过分析视觉注意力下降现象，引入一种名为IKOD的解码策略，该策略融合短序列的高图像注意力键值信息，减轻注意力损失。

Result: 实验显示IKOD在降低幻觉和增强整体性能上表现优异，且无需额外训练或工具支持。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种高效轻量的框架，针对多种LVLM模型均有普适性，并且成功缓解了长序列生成中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

Motivation: 现有生成技术迅速发展，但视频内容保护仍然欠缺，急需解决此问题以防范滥用风险。

Method: 提出VideoGuard，通过联合帧优化和视频运动信息融入，添加微扰以干扰生成模型功能，从而保护视频。

Result: 实验显示VideoGuard在保护性能上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard能有效保护视频内容免受生成模型的恶意篡改，具有显著的应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数研究集中于人类图像的偏见问题，而本文关注于生成对象（如汽车）的种群偏见问题，旨在解决目前未被充分重视的细微但普遍的现象。

Method: 提出SODA框架，通过比较含种群暗示词的生成图片与中性提示词生成的图片，系统测量图像的偏见。使用三种前沿模型，在五种对象类别中进行分析。

Result: 发现部分种群群体与特定视觉属性高度关联，生成图像呈现出性别或种族偏见，并且部分模型生成的多样性较低扩大了视觉差异。

Conclusion: 提出的审计框架可测试生成模型中的刻板印象偏见，为规范与负责任的AI开发提供实践方法。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Motivation: 现有的DiT模型在文本生成图像任务中表现优异，但其计算成本和参数规模较大，难以适用于资源受限场景。同时，现有的后训练量化在极低比特下性能大幅下降，需解决这一问题。

Method: 该方法提出了LRQ-DiT框架，包括：1）引入双对数量化(Twin-Log Quantization)，适应权值分布，降低量化误差；2）提出自适应旋转方案(Adaptive Rotation Scheme)，动态使用Hadamard或异常感知旋转，以缓解激活异常值的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集（PixArt、FLUX、COCO、MJHQ和sDCI）的实验验证中，LRQ-DiT能在低比特量化下保持图像质量，并优于现有的PTQ方法。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT解决了DiT模型在低比特后训练量化中的关键问题，显著减小了内存和运算需求，同时仍然能提供优质的生成图像表现，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Result: 实验结果表明，与原始SAM模型相比，ParticleSAM在定量和定性实验中均具有显著优势。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM不仅在建筑材料颗粒分割上展示出应用潜力，还可扩展至其他需要小颗粒分割的领域。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏性在图像恢复中对提高效率与存储的关键作用，并探索优化算法在满足稀疏性的同时最大限度保障恢复质量。

Method: 使用多种优化方法对稀疏字典学习的稀疏性与恢复质量的关系进行分析和比较。

Result: 发现不同方法对应不同的稀疏性状态，高稀疏性通常不影响恢复质量，即使恢复图像与原始学习数据库差异较大。

Conclusion: 在SDL中引入高稀疏性通常不会影响图像恢复质量，并且稀疏性对于提高后续处理与存储的效率至关重要。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Motivation: 在组织病理学中，由于组织样本较大且存在处理过程中的各种误差，传统拼接方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出SemanticStitcher，通过视觉病理学基础模型的潜在特征表征进行语义匹配，结合稳健的姿态估计，生成拼接后的完整组织切片。

Result: 实验表明，SemanticStitcher在三个数据集上均展现了在拼接精度和边界匹配正确率上的显著优势。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher能够稳健拼接组织切片，提升了当前拼接技术的性能，为自动化组织切片分析提供了更强支持。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Conclusion: PECM框架在解决数据歧义和改进复杂临床场景中跨模态检索可靠性方面表现出色，可显著提高检索精度和一致性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: EditGarment数据集填补了基于自然语言指令进行单一服装编辑的数据集空白，并为未来服装编辑研究提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: MAUP成功将自然图像基础模型适配到医学图像分割任务，无需额外训练即能获得优异表现，为跨领域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

*Shiben Liu,Mingyue Xu,Huijie Fan,Qiang Wang,Yandong Tang,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DKUA的框架，通过分布感知和统一知识学习来解决LReID中的遗忘和适应问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LReID需要在保留旧知识与适应新信息之间找到平衡，但现有方法未解决分布感知和跨域统一知识两个关键问题。

Method: 提出分布感知知识统一和关联框架，包括分布感知模型、适应型知识整合（AKC）、统一知识关联（UKA）与分布式知识转移（DKT）。

Result: 实验显示，DKUA在避免遗忘和提升泛化能力方面分别实现了平均mAP/R@1提升7.6%和5.3%。

Conclusion: DKUA方法有效解决了LReID中的遗忘和跨域适应问题，并显著优于现有方法，将公开代码以促进研究发展。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为CoEmoGen的新方法，用于生成语义清晰且情感忠实的图像，并通过心理学启发的模块和高质量字幕实现情感驱动的艺术创作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型难以处理抽象情感，同时专为EICG设计的方法存在语义不一致、歧义和可扩展性问题。该研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了一种名为CoEmoGen的管道，利用多模态大语言模型生成注重情感导向的高质量字幕，并设计了分层低秩适配(HiLoRA)模块，用于建模共享的低级特征和情感特定的高级语义。

Result: 通过定量、定性分析和用户研究证明，CoEmoGen在情感忠实度和语义一致性方面表现出色。此外，还创建了一个名为EmoArt的大规模情感艺术图像数据集。

Conclusion: CoEmoGen可以有效解决EICG中的挑战，提供高效的情感和语义建模手段，为情感驱动的艺术创作提供路径。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探索了血清脂质类别与视网膜微血管特征之间的关系，发现不同脂质类别与特定血管特征密切相关，支持视网膜微血管作为系统代谢健康非侵入性标志物的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜微血管成像作为评估系统性代谢健康的非侵入性方法受到关注，但其与脂质组学之间的关联尚未明确。本研究旨在填补该空白。

Method: 利用Spearman相关分析研究血清脂质（如游离脂肪酸、甘油二酯、三酰甘油和胆固醇酯）与十种视网膜微血管特征之间的关系，同时采用Benjamini-Hochberg方法调整显著性水平，并整合深度学习提取的视网膜特征数据。

Result: 游离脂肪酸与血管扭曲性相关，胆固醇酯与动脉和静脉宽度相关，而甘油二酯和三酰甘油与微血管宽度和复杂性呈负相关，展示了视网膜血管结构与循环脂质谱之间的特定反映关系。

Conclusion: 研究首次在健康群体中整合DL提取的视网膜特征与脂质亚类数据，揭示了病变或治疗影响之外的微血管结构变化，为视网膜微血管作为代谢健康非侵入性标志物提供支持。

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Conclusion: 经验证，ARAS与QARAD框架提供了一种高效、准确且语义可控的异常合成及检测方法，为后续研究和应用提供了有价值的方向。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了针对口述数学表达式转换的新方法，尤其是将其转录为LaTeX格式，并提供了开放的多语言大规模数据集和新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前已有研究在自动语音识别（ASR）和语言模型（LM）中取得显著进展，但将口述数学表达式转为LaTeX的任务仍未被深入探索。其可应用于教育和科研领域，如课程记录和笔记创建，但现有方法存在多语言覆盖不足、数据集有限等问题。

Method: 研究提供了首个多语言开放的大规模数据集（含6.6万条语音样本）。用ASR后处理模型、少样本提示及音频语言模型进行评估。同时建立新的基准测试，提出对数学句子和表达式的转录评估方法。

Result: 在MathSpeech基准上，其模型的字符错误率（CER）与现有模型相当（28%对30%）。然而，在新提出的S2L-equations基准上，其模型表现超过现有模型40个百分点（27%对64%）。同时达到了40%的数学句子字符错误率。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了数学内容转录的准确性，提供了多语言数据集及评估基准，为多模态AI的未来发展奠定了基础，特别是在数学内容识别领域。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如捕获-重捕法以及距离采样等虽然成熟但耗时或受空间限制，该研究旨在探索无人机技术在野生动物密度估算中的优越性。

Method: 在无叶期利用无人机进行单日调查，采用系统随机化飞行路径，结合三种推算方法进行动物密度估算，结果与相机陷阱的随机遭遇模型(REM)进行对比分析。

Result: 无人机方法与相机陷阱的REM结果在大致密度上相近，但通常显示更高的密度值，表明无人机可以更准确反映开放和森林区域日间活动的野生动物密度。

Conclusion: 无人机技术能够提供有前景且可扩展的野生动物密度估算方法，具有高效、非侵入性等优点，且侧重展现野生动物活动的不同视角。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效且可扩展的管道，用于从稀疏分布的农村历史地图中提取建筑特征，验证了其在爱尔兰历史地图中的高效性和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中在城市区域，且计算资源占用高，这对需要大规模分析农村地区的数据验证和历史研究提出了挑战。

Method: 使用分层的机器学习方法：先用卷积神经网络(CNN)分类器排除低可能性区域，再用CNN分割方法精确提取建筑特征。

Result: 验证表明，该方法在效率和性能上优于传统分割技术，能够识别历史地图中的建筑分布特点。

Conclusion: 通过测试，发现方法可应用于历史与考古研究，尤其是揭示废弃定居点，如在爱尔兰图利地区发现大饥荒后被废弃的村庄。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT通过改进编码器与框架设计显著提高了分割任务性能，具备更强的普适性与准确性。

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: MetaScope为金属透镜内窥镜的发展奠定了数据和算法基础，展示了解决金属透镜成像物理问题的潜力。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种雷达为基础的人体姿态估计方法——RadProPoser，这是一种概率编码-解码架构，能够有效预测三维关节位置及不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现隐私保护、光照不变的人体姿态估计，同时克服雷达数据噪声与多路径效应的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个基于3发射器与4接收器MIMO雷达的数据分析架构RadProPoser，结合变分推断与关键点回归预测，不仅估计三维关节位置，还预测不确定性，并探索了高斯与拉普拉斯分布的概率模型。

Result: 在拥有光学动作捕捉数据集的测试中，RadProPoser达到了平均每关节位置误差6.425厘米，且不确定性校准表现出色，同时在下游活动分类中取得了0.870的F1得分。

Conclusion: RadProPoser是首个从原始雷达张量数据端到端建模与量化关节不确定性的系统，为雷达人体运动分析奠定了可解释性和可靠性基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Conclusion: Attention Zoom在不增加显著架构开销的情况下，提升了CNN的性能并具备广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present Attention Zoom, a modular and model-agnostic spatial attention
mechanism designed to improve feature extraction in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional attention approaches that require
architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer
that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated
Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet,
showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy.
Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method
encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with
minimal architectural overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前由于云层覆盖和夜间条件限制，导致多光谱卫星影像可用性不足的问题，提供一致的数据源。

Method: 采用基于条件潜变量流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: 模型达到了0.7432的FID得分以及0.6156（NDWI）和0.6874（NDVI）的SSIM分数，显示生成影像在真实感和结构相似性上表现强劲。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可用或不可靠的遥感应用提供了潜力解决方案，增强了数据生成的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Motivation: 旨在利用事件相机捕获的高动态范围和高时间分辨率特性，以更高效地识别面部表情。

Method: 采用迁移学习，将用于面部重建的生成对抗方法训练的编码器权重迁移至表情识别；结合LSTM捕捉动态信息，并提出一种新事件表示方法TIE。

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上，evTransFER实现了93.6%的识别率，相比现有方法性能提升25.9%以上。

Conclusion: evTransFER框架有效捕获了面部的时空动态特征，是事件相机领域表情识别的一个重要进步。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

*Nassim Ali Ousalah,Peyman Rostami,Anis Kacem,Enjie Ghorbel,Emmanuel Koumandakis,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FPG-NAS，一个面向效率的FLOPs感知门控可微神经架构搜索框架，用于6DoF目标位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单张图像的3D旋转和位移估计在资源受限场景下的高计算需求问题。

Method: 设计了专用于6DoF位姿估计的可微NAS方法，包括任务专属搜索空间、门控机制实现离散操作选择，以及FLOPs正则化保障效率与精度平衡。

Result: 实验在LINEMOD和SPEED+数据集上表明，模型在严苛FLOPs约束下优于以往方法。

Conclusion: FPG-NAS是首个面向6DoF目标位姿估计的可微NAS框架，提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Uni3R的框架，可从未配准的多视图图像中直接生成语义丰富的3D场景表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将语义理解与重建分离或需要昂贵的逐场景优化，限制了可扩展性和通用性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Cross-View Transformer集成多视图信息，并回归一组带有语义特征字段的3D高斯模型，从而实现统一的3D场景表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现达到新水平，如RE10K上的PSNR为25.07，ScanNet上的mIoU为55.84。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种新的通用3D场景重建和理解的模式，推进了领域的前沿。代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniShape提出了一种从单次观测中估计物体姿态和完整形状的方法，无需已知的3D模型或类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次观测下在缺乏3D模型或类别信息时估计物体姿态及形状的问题。

Method: 通过将形状完成过程分解为两个多模态分布：一个是测量值到标准化对象参考框架的投影分布，另一个是基于三平面神经场的几何先验分布，并分别训练生成性扩散模型。

Result: OmniShape在现实世界的挑战性数据集上表现出色，能够生成姿态与形状的多重假设。

Conclusion: 本方法首次实现了概率性姿态和形状估计，为解决相关问题提供了创新思路。

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

### [126] [Veila: Panoramic LiDAR Generation from a Monocular RGB Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03690)
*Youquan Liu,Lingdong Kong,Weidong Yang,Ao Liang,Jianxiong Gao,Yang Wu,Xiang Xu,Xin Li,Linfeng Li,Runnan Chen,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Veila的新框架，通过单目RGB图像实现高保真和可控的全景LiDAR数据生成，使用三种新方法和两个评价指标，实验表明优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成全景LiDAR数据时存在可控性差、空间细节控制不足的问题，通过单目RGB图像提供空间控制信号解决这些问题，但需要克服RGB和LiDAR之间的对齐和结构一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出三个关键技术：(1)引入自适应的信心感知条件机制(CACM)以平衡RGB的语义和深度信息；(2)使用几何跨模态对齐(GCMA)来减少噪声扩散导致的跨模态对齐误差；(3)使用全景特征一致性(PFC)保证单目RGB与LiDAR结构的一致性。此外，提出两项跨模态一致性评价指标。

Result: 在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI和KITTI-Weather数据集上进行实验表明，Veila在生成保真度和跨模态一致性方面达到了最先进的水平，并能用于增强数据生成，提升后续LiDAR语义分割性能。

Conclusion: Veila框架有效解决了单目RGB驱动的全景LiDAR数据生成中的主要挑战，实现了高效跨模态对齐和一致性生成，对于自主驾驶和机器人领域的3D感知具有重要意义。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了La La LiDAR，一个通过语义增强的场景图扩散和关系感知的上下文调节实现的可控LiDAR场景生成模型，能生成结构化的LiDAR布局并支持前景控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型虽可生成高保真LiDAR场景，但缺乏对前景对象和空间关系的显式控制，限制了其在自主驾驶和安全验证等场景的应用。

Method: 提出La La LiDAR模型，其中包括引入语义增强的场景图扩散、关系感知的上下文调节，再通过前景控制注入完成完整场景的生成。还提供了Waymo-SG和nuScenes-SG两个LiDAR场景图数据集以及新的评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，La La LiDAR在LiDAR生成和下游感知任务中达到了先进的性能，成为可控3D场景生成的新基准。

Conclusion: La La LiDAR能通过布局引导的方式生成语义和空间一致的LiDAR场景，解决了现有模型的控制缺陷，同时为下游任务提供了更强的支持。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LiDARCrafter框架，用于4D LiDAR生成与编辑，能解析自然语言指令并实现高质量的场景生成与编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前通用生成模型多关注于视频或占据网格，忽视了LiDAR数据的特殊特性。需要扩展LiDAR生成至动态4D模型，同时解决动态性、时间一致性及评估标准化的挑战。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架LiDARCrafter，采用场景图作为控制输入，利用三分支扩散模型分别生成物体结构、运动轨迹与几何形状。此外引入自回归模块确保生成的4D数据时间一致。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，LiDARCrafter在逼真度、可控性及时间一致性上均达到最先进水平，并构建了一个全面的评估基准。

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为4D LiDAR生成与编辑设立了新标准，为数据增强和仿真拓宽了可能性，同时广泛开放代码与基准促进社区合作。

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了LongVie，一个生成控制式超长视频的端到端自回归框架，以解决时间一致性和视觉退化问题，并在实验中展现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成短视频效果不错，但难以扩展至超长视频，主要面临时间不一致性和视觉退化等问题。

Method: 提出了LongVie框架，其中结合了统一噪声初始化、全局控制信号归一化、多模态控制框架和退化感知训练策略；并引入了长视频基准测试数据集LongVGenBench。

Result: 实验结果显示LongVie在长距离的控制性、一致性和图像质量方面均达到了最新的最优性能。

Conclusion: LongVie成功解决了超长视频生成中的主要问题，为该领域的发展提供了一个强有力的工具。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Trokens的方法，通过将运动轨迹点转化为语义关联的标记来实现少样本动作识别，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在少样本动作识别中，如何有效地选择运动轨迹点和建模其运动模式一直是挑战。作者的动机是在引入语义感知的采样策略和轨迹建模框架方面取得突破。

Method: 方法包括：(1) 提出语义感知采样策略，依据物体尺度和语义相关性自适应分配轨迹点。(2) 开发了一个运动建模框架，利用方向位移直方图（HoD）捕捉轨迹内的动力学，并通过轨迹间关系建模复杂的动作模式。

Result: 方法在六个少样本动作识别数据集上（如Something-Something-V2、Kinetics等）取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 将运动轨迹点转化为语义关联标记的方法有效结合了运动和外观特征，显著提升了少样本动作识别的效果，展示了方法的通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

TL;DR: 介绍了一个名为ICARE的可解释评估框架，用于自动放射学报告生成的临床评估，并展示其在多个维度的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动放射学报告生成评估指标缺乏解释性，难以可靠评估生成报告的临床价值，因此需要开发一种能提供透明解释的评估方法。

Method: 提出ICARE框架，基于大语言模型代理和动态多选问答（MCQA），两个代理借助基础事实（报告真实值或生成值）生成临床问题并相互测试，通过答案一致性评估报告的临床准确性与一致性。

Result: 临床研究表明，ICARE与专家判断更一致，且撰写分析中的干扰测试验证了其对临床内容的敏感性及可重复性。此外，模型对比展示了其对错误模式的解释能力。

Conclusion: ICARE框架为自动放射学报告生成的临床评估提供了一种透明且可解释的方法，有助于推动该领域技术的实际部署。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观NLP任务中标注者分歧问题，通过消除过度集中在个体层面的问题，并更好反映组级多样性。

Method: 提出DEM-MoE（Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts）模型，结合标注者人口特征分组业务和LLM生成的合成注释，以改进模型性能。

Result: DEM-MoE在标注分歧数据集上表现优良，所设计的策略可以优化真实数据与合成数据的结合。

Conclusion: 本研究提升了多样化视角的表示能力，并为优化数据结构提出了适应性策略。

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为Highlight & Summarize (H&S)的新设计模式，以防止大型语言模型(LLM)被越狱或劫持的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM系统容易被恶意输入绕过导致产生非法内容或跳出任务范围的问题。

Method: 提出Highlight & Summarize (H&S)设计模式，通过分离系统流程，使用高亮器提取用户问题相关的文档段落，再由总结器构建回答，从而避免直接暴露用户问题给生成型LLM。

Result: 评估结果显示，对于生成的正确性、相关性和回答质量指标，当采用基于LLM的高亮器时，H&S生成的响应在大多数情况下优于标准RAG流水线。

Conclusion: H&S设计模式体现了防止LLM模型攻击的新方法，提供了增强内容安全性和生成质量的可能性。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言学核心操作“Merge”及其神经认知支持机制，发现了三种不同的结构类型，这些结构可能在不同的发展阶段出现，并受到选择性损害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言学核心合成操作Merge的神经认知机制，及其与句法复杂程度之间的关联。

Method: 分析测试参与者对不同句法复杂性句子的理解，使用集群分析发现结构类型的潜在分类。

Result: 发现三种不同的结构类型与不同的句法操作相关，提出这些类型可能在不同发展阶段出现，并可能受到特定损害。

Conclusion: Merge作为语言核心操作可能在进化中突然出现，尽管如此，其不同类型的句法对象处理由不同的认知机制支持。

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强视听语言模型（LVLM）推理能力的新框架——一致性多模态推理框架（CMRF），通过分解问题、逐步推理和自我评估机制，把复杂问题分解为多个步骤实现深度推理，取得现有数据集上优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视听语言模型已有显著进步，但它们在复杂的多步骤、跨模态常识推理任务中仍表现不佳，尤其缺乏“深度思考”能力，现有方法大多依赖浅层关联而非深度推理。

Method: 提出了一种基于一致性多模态推理框架（CMRF），包括三个核心模块：问题分解单元（RDU）、上下文推理引擎（CIE）以及一致性评估模块（CAM），并结合适应性迭代改进策略以及一个新的多模态日常活动推理数据集（MDAR）。

Result: 在VCR、A-OKVQA和DailyLife-MRC等基准测试中，CMRF表现优异，达到了69.4%的平均准确率，比最佳开源基线表现高出+2.4个百分点，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: CMRF通过模块化设计和迭代优化增强了LVLMs的常识推理能力，各模块对实现一致性和精准推理起到了关键作用，其有效性已通过消融研究和人工评估得到了验证。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

Motivation: 生成式AI正改变艺术创作及人类表达方式，但艺术家对于这一变革的担忧和观点常被忽视。论文旨在直面这一问题。

Method: 采用BERTopic方法，分析了439份来自不同媒介的文本样本，挖掘艺术家与媒体叙述之间的异同，并设计了可重复的分析流程。

Result: 发现媒体中技术术语充当了一种潜在的门槛，将艺术家关注的紧迫问题边缘化，同时构建了一个用于未来研究的多模态基线。

Conclusion: 应推动透明且更深入的涉及艺术家视角的AI创意领域研究，改进主流话语与艺术家之间的对话机制。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

*Haoran Wang,Xiongxiao Xu,Baixiang Huang,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD)的防御方法，通过在生成过程中注入高斯噪声来保护敏感数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成（RAG）系统在涉及隐私或敏感数据时可能遭受的提取攻击问题。

Method: 提出了一个轻量级的推断时防御系统PAD，结合了置信度筛选、高效敏感度估算和上下文噪声校准，并通过Rényi差分隐私会计精确跟踪隐私损失。

Result: 实验表明，在三个真实数据集上，PAD能显著减少隐私信息泄露，同时保持响应的有用性，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAD提供了一种通用且可扩展的隐私解决方案，无需重新训练模型或对语料库进行过滤，是保护敏感领域隐私的关键一步。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

Conclusion: TPARAG揭示了RAG系统在安全性上的关键漏洞，并为提升其鲁棒性提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

Motivation: 理解跨语言在同一主题上的情感与情绪表达差异。

Method: 使用跨语言的方法为文档标注情感（主观/客观）和情绪类别（例如愤怒、快乐），并创建双语情绪词典用于标注可比语料库。

Result: 情感和情绪标注在同一新闻机构的文章中表现一致，在来自不同新闻机构的文章中存在差异。

Conclusion: 所提方法语言无关，具有可推广性，可用于理解不同语言对相同主题的情感和情绪表达。

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Conclusion: 多代理方法结合记忆存储和主题障碍框架显著提升了长文故事生成的逻辑性和吸引力，提供了一种适用于长文本生成的新方案。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Motivation: 在不增加大量计算和数据成本的前提下，创建具备长链推理能力和领域特定知识的双能力模型。

Method: 提出RCP-Merging框架，将推理模型权重视为基础，根据推理能力指标选择性整合领域特定模型的权重。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B、Llama3.1-8B和Qwen2.5-1.5B模型上进行实验，在BioMedicine和Finance领域任务表现分别提升了9.5%和9.2%，且未显著损害原始推理能力。

Conclusion: RCP-Merging能够有效整合长链推理能力与领域特定知识，为构建综合性能优异的LLM提供了一种高效的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强语言模型指令遵从性的框架，通过引入预览与自检等严格推理机制，显著提高了模型在复杂指令上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在解决数学问题、编程任务和一般性推理上已取得进展，但在复杂指令的遵从性方面表现仍不稳定。本文分析认为这是由于推理阶段的惰性推理造成的。

Method: 构建一个包括生成复杂指令、过滤无效提示、采样有效数据集的流程；并采用熵保留监督微调（Entropy-SFT）和基于规则的密集奖励强化学习（TEA-RL）相结合的策略，旨在通过调整推理机制来提升模型遵从复杂指令的能力。

Result: 实验表明，对比多种规模的模型，该方法在遵从复杂指令上的表现显著优于现有的开源和封闭源码模型。

Conclusion: 本文的方法在提升语言模型复杂指令上的推理力与遵从性方面具有重要意义，为未来的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Method: 利用手动标注的数据集开发和训练了两个机器学习模型（主题分类和情感分类），并应用于分析议会话语数据中的主题趋势和情感分布。

Result: 在主题分类上，模型的平均AUROC值为0.94；在情感分类上为0.89，显示了良好的性能。同时揭示了政党角色（政府或反对党）如何影响话语风格。

Conclusion: 政党话语风格不仅受到意识形态立场的影响，还受执政责任的塑造，提供了关于议题演变、情感动态和党派策略的新见解。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

Motivation: 探讨文本到图像模型中语法性别对视觉生成的影响，弥补以往仅关注人口统计和刻板印象的研究不足。

Method: 构建跨语言的数据集，包括五种性别化语言和两种性别中立语言，生成28,800张图像，分析三种主流T2I模型的性别表现差异。

Result: 语法性别对图像生成明显影响。例如，阳性语法标记平均使男性表征增加到73%，女性表征增加到38%，效果随语言资源和模型架构而异。

Conclusion: 语言结构本身会影响AI生成的视觉输出，为多语言、多模态系统的偏见和公平性研究提供了新维度。

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型依赖于大量数据以学习语言变化，而这些数据通常包含私人信息，存在被提取隐私数据的风险，因此研究如何保护隐私成为必要。

Method: 分析和探讨现有针对文本数据隐私保护的预处理方法，包括屏蔽和假名化手段，以实现数据匿名化。

Result: 提供了在领域无关的自然语言处理任务中，能够有效保护隐私的多种预处理方案。

Conclusion: 尽管无法实现完全匿名化，但通过一定技术可在保护隐私的同时支持大语言模型的整体功能。

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.
Providing a benchmark made of controlled stimuli to better evaluate their

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在心理健康中的文化敏感性及其局限性。

Method: 通过使用西方和东方人物设定提示LLM，实验中采用英语及东方主要语言（中文、日语、印地语）进行测试与比较。

Result: LLMs在以英语提示时未能充分反映文化差异，但使用东方语言的提示在某些设置中有所改善。研究发现模型对文化背景的敏感性较低，且存在一种强大的文化无关的症状层级结构，这限制了文化信息的影响。

Conclusion: 目前的通用LLMs缺乏足够的文化敏感性，无法满足文化相关的心理健康应用需求。

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

*Deborah Dore,Elena Cabrio,Serena Villata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门用于政治话语分析的预训练语言模型RooseBERT，并证明了其在政治辩论相关任务上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前政治语言及其辩论形式的复杂性使得自动分析变得极具挑战，需要基于政治话语特性开发专门的语言模型。

Method: 在大规模政治辩论和演讲语料库上预训练RooseBERT，并在命名实体识别、情感分析、辩论成分检测分类及辩论关系预测分类四个任务上进行微调评估。

Result: 与通用语言模型相比，RooseBERT在政治辩论分析的四个任务上表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 领域特定的预训练能够显著提高政治辩论分析的表现，并为研究社区公开了RooseBERT模型。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

*Duzhen Zhang,Chenxing Li,Jiahua Dong,Qi Liu,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了稳定性-可塑性权衡方法(SPT)来改进持续命名实体识别(CNER)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNER方法倾向于稳定性过高，缺乏对新知识的吸收能力，需平衡稳定性与可塑性。

Method: 从表示和权重角度提出SPT方法，引入池化操作与动态权重融合，同时设计权重选择机制和置信度伪标注方法。

Result: 在三个基准数据集的十个设置上，SPT方法表现优于现有CNER技术。

Conclusion: SPT通过平衡稳定性和可塑性有效提升了CNER性能。

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是弥补之前大部分研究依赖虚构用户数据的局限，验证LLMs在基于真实人类数据模拟经济行为的能力。

Method: 使用PWYW定价实验和522名韩国参与者的详细用户信息，对三种最先进的多模态LLMs进行了系统比较，并探讨不同的用户信息输入方法对预测性能的影响。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs在个体层级预测中存在困难，但在群体层面表现出合理的行为趋势。而常见的提示方法并不优于简单提示，个体叙述重建和检索增强生成也未带来显著收益。

Conclusion: 本文提供了LLMs在基于真实人类数据模拟经济行为方面的首次全面评估，为基于用户数据的计算社会科学应用提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的间隔重复算法难以处理语义干扰和个性化调整，论文旨在解决语言学习中的关键语义混淆问题，特别是在考试情境下的高成功率需求。

Method: 通过结合大语言模型(LLM)进行语义分析，采用基于语义相似性的评价机制，同时与传统间隔重复算法相结合。算法还整合了个性化学习档案以提高适应性。

Result: 在与六种基准算法对比的实验中，LECTOR展示了显著提升，成功率达到90.2%，比最佳基准算法高出2.0%。特别是在处理语义相似概念时表现出色，并减少了因混淆导致的错误。

Conclusion: LECTOR以其有效性和高计算效率证明了其在智能辅导系统和自适应学习平台中的应用前景。

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具有人类核心语言交流要素——语言收敛，并发现模型倾向于过度适应对话风格，且不同配置的语言收敛模式有所差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在语言生成中的表现是否与人类相似，特别是它们是否具备语言收敛这一人类核心语言交流特性。

Method: 通过比较16个语言模型在三个对话语料库中的输出与原始人类对话的差异，分析它们的语言风格变化和多个文体特征下的表现。

Result: 模型在对话风格上表现出强烈的适应性，但通常相较于人类基线存在显著过拟合现象。此外，较大的和经过指令调整的模型比其预训练版本在语言收敛上表现较弱。

Conclusion: 由于模型与人类在语言收敛模式上的显著差异，推测导致这些行为的底层机制可能非常不同。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成叙事中的性别偏见，提出并分析了一个新数据集StereoBias-Stories。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各种应用中的使用日益广泛，研究动机源于对其可能放大性别偏见的担忧，特别是在长文本生成中潜在的隐形偏见。

Method: 提出了StereoBias-Stories数据集，通过对随机心理刻板印象属性进行条件生成短故事，分析生成内容中性别偏见的表现与变化。

Result: 发现：（1）无性别刻板印象提示时，模型普遍偏向于男性；（2）性别独立属性条件可减轻偏见，多个男性刻板印象属性会放大偏见，女性属性则缓解偏见；（3）模型偏见与心理学分类的符合程度随模型大小增加而提高。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了以心理学为基础对LLMs进行评估的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Motivation: 希望通过更准确的方法帮助教授估测考试题目难度，从而提高教学评估质量。

Method: 将三位教授与多种基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法进行比较，包括直接询问Gemini 2.5的预测及利用LLM的不确定性进行监督学习，并使用42个训练样本训练模型。

Result: 教授难以区分易难题目，而直接询问Gemini 2.5效果较好，使用LLM不确定性进行监督学习效果更佳。

Conclusion: 监督学习结合LLM不确定性可显著帮助教授更准确地估测考试题目难度，从而改善评估质量。

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Motivation: 当前的内容审核系统过于依赖有噪声的标签驱动学习，难以与审核规则对齐且决策过程不透明。

Method: Hi-Guard采用分层模型管道进行审核，使用轻量化模型初步过滤内容，而后通过分层分类和路径式分类进一步处理。此外，融入规则定义到模型提示中，并通过多级软边际奖励和群组相对策略优化提升预测能力和解释质量。

Result: 实验证明Hi-Guard在分类精度、泛化能力和解释性方面均优于现有系统，并成功在实际部署中实现了内容安全的高效处理。

Conclusion: Hi-Guard为内容安全审核提供了可扩展、透明且值得信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了集体测试时扩展（CTTS）以提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，提出了一个新框架CTTS-MM，以多代理和多奖励模型的协作实现性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单一代理与奖励模型互动的测试时扩展方法（STTS）受到能力限制，本文旨在通过探索多代理协作打破这一瓶颈。

Method: 设计了三种CTTS的主要范式（SA-MR, MA-SR, MA-MR），并重点提出了CTTS-MM框架，其中包含代理协作搜索（ACS）和奖励模型混合（MoR）两大部分。

Result: 实验表明，CTTS-MM在七个主流基准测试中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多代理与多奖励模型协作的CTTS方法可以显著提升大语言模型的测试时推理能力，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自然语言处理方法不适用从小说中提取角色及其互动的任务，特别在缺乏标注数据的低资源语言中表现不佳。

Method: 设计了Taggus，一种结合POS标注和启发式的方法，用于破解角色识别与共指代问题，并检测角色互动关系。

Result: Taggus在角色识别任务中取得94.1%的F1分数，角色互动检测中取得75.9%，比现有技术分别提高50.7%和22.3%。

Conclusion: Taggus在葡文文学角色社交网络构建中表现出色，并且开源供进一步开发。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的ICL范式——JointThinking，通过结合Thinking和Nothinking两种推理模式来提高推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多关注训练和推理策略，而对RLLMs的ICL潜力探索较少，作者希望填补这一空白。

Method: 提出JointThinking方法：模型在Thinking和Nothinking模式下生成平行答案，如果结果不一致，则启动第二轮推理，减少不必要的计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，JointThinking在多个基准上表现优于Few-shot CoT和多数投票法，并在分布外任务上显著超越基于训练的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: JointThinking通过整合不同推理模式提升了推理鲁棒性，展现了多样化结构思维的价值，并展示了该方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的临床访问存在障碍及社交污名导致许多抑郁病例未被诊断，现有方法仅对帖子进行整体标签化，忽视了与DSM-5标准具体症状的关联，影响临床相关性和可解释性。

Method: 创建了一个包含1484篇长文本帖子的新数据集ReDSM5，每个句子由专业心理学家基于DSM-5抑郁症状标准注释，并提供简洁的临床合理性解释。还进行了词汇、句法和情感模式的探索性分析。

Result: 开发了ReDSM5数据集，为多标签症状分类和解释生成任务确定了基准标准，提供未来检测和可解释性研究的参考结果。

Conclusion: ReDSM5数据集结合症状特定的监督和专家解释，改进了抑郁症检测模型的解读能力，有助于诊断的临床相关性和可解释性研究进展。

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

Motivation: 社交媒体错误信息的传播对社会有严重影响，目前主流的静态学习方法无法应对新闻真实度因社会环境而动态改变的问题。

Method: 提出MISDER框架，通过LSTM模型、连续动力学方程和预训练动力学系统实现动态环境表示的学习和预测，并提出三种变体：MISDER-LSTM、MISDER-ODE和MISDER-PT。

Result: 实验在两个主流数据集上测试，表明MISDER在错误信息检测中的有效性优于主流隐含方法。

Conclusion: MISDER通过动态建模和环境表征预测，展示了在自动检测错误信息时的显著优越性，为实际社交媒体环境下的错误信息检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Result: 实验显示加入随机性的Gumbel-Softmax策略显著提升了8个推理基准的效果。

Conclusion: 增加合理随机性可充分释放Soft Thinking的潜力，同时保持推理的平滑性。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

*Rita González-Márquez,Philipp Berens,Dmitry Kobak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究对比学习中文本嵌入生成的两种主要数据增强策略，发现使用裁剪增强比使用dropout方法效果更佳。此外，提出在域内数据中，自监督微调可以快速生成高质量文本嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的顶尖文本嵌入模型需要大量有标注的文本对进行监督微调，而计算机视觉领域无需标签，仅基于数据增强的自监督学习已取得显著成功，因此本文希望探索自监督方法在文本嵌入中的应用。

Method: 本文对比了裁剪和dropout两种自监督数据增强策略，并通过在MTEB及特定域内数据评估嵌入质量，同时分析微调过程中的变换层对表示质量的影响，并验证微调仅最后几层的有效性。

Result: 在对比实验中，裁剪增强明显优于dropout增强；域外数据中，表示效果仍不及监督SOTA模型，而在域内数据中，自监督微调后的文本嵌入质量接近于监督模型。在最后转换层的微调对质量显著提升，仅微调这些层即可获得接近效果。

Conclusion: 裁剪增强是生成高质量文本嵌入的有效策略，自监督微调在短时间内可生成接近监督SOTA的嵌入质量，微调最后几层具有高效性。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出CarbonPDF，一种专注于回答PDF格式可持续性报告中的碳足迹问题的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过PDF发布的产品可持续性报告格式多样，信息提取困难，缺乏标准化。

Method: 引入开源数据集CarbonPDF-QA，通过对Llama 3进行微调来开发CarbonPDF技术。

Result: CarbonPDF在回答碳足迹问题上优于现有最先进方法，包括在表格与文本数据上进行微调的QA系统。

Conclusion: 提出的技术有效处理PDF文档中非结构化和不一致的数据问题，为解析产品报告中的碳足迹信息提供解决方案。

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

TL;DR: 提出UPLME，一个不确定性感知的概率语言建模框架，用于解决同情心检测中的回归问题并处理标签噪声，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前监督学习中的同情心回归面临自报告同情心评分的噪声问题，而回归的标签噪声研究尚不充分。

Method: 提出了UPLME框架，结合了概率语言模型、异方差不确定性预测、贝叶斯概念和变分模型集成，并引入两个新型损失组件以改善模型表现。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集上的皮尔逊相关系数提升和校准误差降低，验证了UPLME在标签噪声条件下的先进表现。

Conclusion: UPLME框架在处理带有噪声的同情心回归任务上表现卓越，能够有效分离噪声样本与干净样本，同时提升了模型的校准能力。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了FilBench，一个用于评估大语言模型在菲律宾语言任务表现的基准测试，并发现当前模型在阅读理解和翻译能力上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在英文任务上表现出色，但其在菲律宾等特定语言上的能力仍然未知。本研究旨在通过引入FilBench来填补这一研究空白，评估LLMs在菲律宾语言相关任务中的表现能力。

Method: 设计FilBench基准测试，涵盖文化知识、经典NLP、阅读理解和生成等任务，并使用27种最新的LLM对其进行评估。

Result: 研究发现，许多LLM在阅读理解和翻译能力上表现欠佳，性能最佳的GPT-4o得分为72.23%，而专为东南亚语言训练的模型最高得分仅为61.07%。

Conclusion: 语言特定的基准测试如FilBench对推动菲律宾NLP研究及促进菲律宾语言在LLM开发中的融入具有重要意义。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

Result: 实验表明，使用Marito改进了英语到Tshivenda的机器翻译准确性和领域一致性。

Conclusion: Marito是开发多语言NLP技术的可扩展基础，推动南非语言在数字时代中的代表性。

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's
official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence
of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets
remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them
unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Marito} addresses
this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these
scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the
foundational \emph{Marito} dataset, released under the equitable,
Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we
integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific
consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language
models. \emph{Marito} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and
equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity
is represented in the digital age.

TL;DR: EmbedGrad通过优化文本提示嵌入来提高基础模型在多任务下的部署效果，在多个任务中展现了显著提升的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的提示工程和参数调整方法在适应任务时存在精确度与复杂性之间的不足，提出EmbedGrad框架来平衡两者的问题。

Method: EmbedGrad通过梯度优化的方式，调整文本提示嵌入，分离训练与推理，实现更精细的提示校准。例如，在推理时仅使用优化后的嵌入与用户查询交互。

Result: 在数学推理、情感分析和因果判断任务中，EmbedGrad显著提高了准确性，例如数学推理任务中，Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B模型的准确率从14.74%提升到58.96%。

Conclusion: EmbedGrad结合提示工程与模型参数调节的优点，在无需改变模型结构的前提下，有效提升任务适应性，展现了嵌入优化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以在无需复杂提示或微调的情况下提升模型与人工喜好的一致性。

Method: 提出了LAGER框架，利用语言模型的中上层内部表示，通过跨层信息整合与软max分布计算，生成细粒度评分，同时保持语言模型主干不变。

Result: 在Flask、HelpSteer和BIGGen基准测试中，Spearman相关性提高了7.5%，且在数据选择与情感理解等下游任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: LAGER在无需推理步骤的情况下，匹配或超越了基于推理的方法，是一种轻量高效的评估优化框架。

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域迁移时因灾难性遗忘造成的性能下降问题。

Method: 通过结合动态知识图谱与指令调优，KILO利用域特定知识引导训练过程，以增强新领域适应能力和已学知识的保留。

Result: KILO在针对BioASQ、SciQ、TweetEval和MIND等四个领域的连续适应测试中，与多种基线相比表现更佳，指标包括向后迁移、向前迁移、F1评分、保留率和训练效率。

Conclusion: KILO通过结合结构化知识检索和指令提示，有效应对了连续学习场景中的领域迁移挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

Method: 提出Double-Bench，这是一个大型、多语言、多模态的评估系统，涵盖6种语言和4种文档类型，基于人工验证的高质量查询及多步查询，提供对文档RAG系统各组件的精细化评估。

Result: 实验表明，文本与视觉嵌入模型的绩效差距逐渐缩小，同时现有RAG框架存在过度自信的问题，常在无证据支持时给出答案。

Conclusion: Double-Bench为研究文档RAG系统提供了全面和开放的基础，作者计划每年发布新基准以保持数据的时效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

Conclusion: 研究指出LVLMs在使用中的局限性，并通过创新框架提升了模型在多模态讽刺分析任务上的表现。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is

Motivation: 现有方法借助语言模型处理CTR预测，但用户行为序列中的无语义分隔符导致语义片段化问题，限制了预测效果。

Method: 提出CTR-Sink框架，在用户行为之间插入sink tokens（例如时间距离等信号）；并采用两阶段训练策略，引导注意力聚焦于这些sink tokens，从而捕捉行为间的相关性。

Result: 在工业数据集和两个开源数据集上进行了实验，并通过可视化验证了该方法在不同场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: CTR-Sink有效解决了语言模型在CTR任务中的语义片段化问题，提高了模型的预测能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

Motivation: 调查LLMs在专业领域中欠佳表现的原因，分析是因为缺乏领域知识还是提示信息不足。

Method: 提出PartialOrderEval工具，将基准测试输入按从简到详的提示顺序重新排列，并在HumanEval和ParEval数据集上进行实验对比。

Result: 实验表明，各任务中提示敏感性不同，细化提示（包括明确I/O、处理边界条件和分步操作）显著改善性能。

Conclusion: 优化提示详细度可提升LLMs在某些领域代码生成的效果，提示内容的设计对性能至关重要。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise

TL;DR: CompassVerifier是一种轻量级的、多领域能力的高效验证模型，能够处理多种问题类型并识别异常响应，同时推出了VerifierBench基准测试以评估验证能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的答案验证方法在规则匹配和一般语言模型的验证中存在繁琐的定制工作，同时缺乏全面的基准和通用性验证方法。

Method: 开发了CompassVerifier模型，该模型具有多领域处理能力，可验证数学、知识和推理任务的回答，并通过引入VerifierBench基准，其中包括从多种数据源收集的模型输出及其元错误模式手动分析结果，来提升模型的可靠性和有效性。

Result: CompassVerifier展示了跨数学、知识和推理任务的验证能力，能够处理复杂答案格式，并识别异常或无效回答。

Conclusion: CompassVerifier与VerifierBench可用于改进答案验证、评估协议及强化学习研究，推动答案验证领域的发展。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code
and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier.

TL;DR: 本文分析了“XAI Challenge 2025”这一结合可解释性AI（XAI）与教育领域的黑客竞赛，探讨如何通过大型语言模型（LLMs）和符号推理提升问答系统的透明性与可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在教育领域的整合日益加深，确保技术的透明性和可解释性成为关键需求，但针对教育场景的XAI研究仍较少。本文旨在通过一次实际竞赛，探索将LLMs与符号推理相结合来优化学生问答系统的可解释性。

Method: 组织了一场名为“XAI Challenge 2025”的国际黑客竞赛，由胡志明市理工大学和TRNS-AI联合举办，提供高质量、基于逻辑模板和专家审阅的真实数据集，要求参赛者开发轻量级LLM或混合模型的问答系统，能够回答学生关于大学政策的查询并生成清晰的逻辑解释。

Result: 竞赛验证了LLMs与符号系统相结合对开发可解释性教育AI技术的潜力，同时提供了可扩展的数据与竞赛框架，推动了行业透明性和信任度的研究。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了结合LLMs和符号推理的方法可提升AI教育问答系统的可解释性，竞赛方式为教育领域的未来XAI系统开发和研究竞争提供了借鉴模板。

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何在AI代理系统中实现成本效益的平衡，并提出一种名为Efficient Agents的新框架，以降低成本且维持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在代理系统复杂性和成本效性之间实现平衡的需求，以应对日益高昂的运行成本和复杂性威胁到的可扩展性问题。

Method: 通过GAIA基准测试分析LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时的扩展策略，对比操作成本和性能之间的权衡，并开发Efficient Agents框架。

Result: Efficient Agents框架在性能上保留了96.7%的领先开源代理框架OWL表现，同时运行成本从0.398美元降至0.228美元，提升了28.4%的成本效率。

Conclusion: Efficient Agents框架优化了复杂性与任务需求的匹配，提升了AI代理系统的可达性与可持续性，为设计高效的代理系统提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 探讨解决不具备领域闭合假设(DCA)条件下的规划问题方法，包括对动态对象集变化的规划问题进行了形式化，提出了一种新规划搜索方法，并验证了其理论正确性及实际效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对经典规划和一致性规划中假设的领域闭合性，即固定有限对象的假设无法满足动态对象变化问题的情形，研究此类问题的解决方案。

Method: 使用一阶逻辑形式化动态对象问题，限制计划长度，并提出一种在规划时具体化动作序列搜索的方法，并从理论层面验证该方法的完备性和正确性。

Result: 证明了该方法的理论正确性和完备性，并通过概念验证实现展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的无领域闭合假设的规划方法适用于有限计划长度场景，并能解决某些序列化的通用化规划问题，在理论上和实践上均表现了良好效果。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法（VSNIT），用于恢复位置数据中的缺失活动序列，实现更高的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LBS数据的活动序列因稀疏性导致的信息丢失问题。

Method: 提出了一种融合可变选择网络（VSN）与插入变换器（Insertion Transformer）的模型——VSNIT，处理动态协变量的同时恢复缺失活动序列。

Result: 实验表明，VSNIT在恢复活动序列的准确性与多样性上显著优于基线模型，可更真实地模拟活动模式并修复活动过渡。

Conclusion: VSNIT展示了在活动序列恢复任务中的卓越性能，有助于增强LBS数据在移动性分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI在科学发现中的应用缺乏透明性、准确性和操控性，科学家难以充分发挥其潜力。

Method: 提出CLIO（认知循环原位优化）方法，通过开放设计，增强科学家对AI推理过程的观察、调整与控制能力。

Result: 在无需进一步训练的情况下，GPT-4.1结合CLIO在HLE测试上的准确率达22.37%，相较原始模型提升了161.64%。

Conclusion: CLIO通过开放设计提供透明性和操控性，显著改善了AI在科学发现中的效用，可帮助科学家更好地理解和指导AI的决策过程。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

TL;DR: 提出一种多代理系统（MAS）用于放射学视觉问答（RVQA），解决复杂推理和提升回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）的RVQA方法面临准确性不足、幻觉以及跨模态失配等挑战。

Method: 设计多代理系统（MAS），拥有专门的代理用于上下文理解、多模态推理及答案验证，同时引入通过模型分歧筛选获得的困难数据集进行评估。

Result: 在多个强基线模型上表现出优越性和有效性，同时通过案例研究展示了可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 多代理方法在需要复杂推理的临床人工智能应用中展现了解释性和可信性潜力。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

TL;DR: 当前的基础模型和代理在长期计划形成方面存在不足，但现有的评估基准无效。作者提出基于Countdown游戏的新规划基准，能更好地测试规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的规划基准测试无法充分测量基础模型和代理的长期规划能力，缺乏一个标准化的评估工具。

Method: 利用Countdown游戏设计一个新的规划基准，通过自然语言描述问题实例、生成计算难度高且多样性丰富的实例，评估现有规划方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，相较于24点游戏，新的动态基准对现有的LLM方法仍然极具挑战性，展现了更高的难度和广泛性。

Conclusion: 提议的Countdown规划基准更科学且难度更高，可更精准地评估规划能力的不足。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流的大型语言模型在后训练方法下性能和推理能力得到了增强，但日语LLM由于资源限制难以取得相同的提升，故提出改进方法。

Method: 借鉴任务向量理论，从推理能力强的LLM中提取推理向量并应用于日语LLM，以此增强其推理能力。

Result: 在资源受限的情况下，也能显著提升日语LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 方法简单有效，不仅提升了日语LLM性能，还为其他语言模型的改进提供了启示。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PentestJudge，一个用于评估渗透测试代理行动的系统。通过使用大语言模型（LLM）作为评估工具，PentestJudge可以基于特定环境的任务分解评价代理行为的质量，并与人类专家对比得分，表现出接近0.83的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个有效的评估系统，用于检测渗透测试代理是否符合操作标准，以解决传统方法无法程序化评估的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种层级树状结构的评分规则，将渗透测试任务分解为可管理的具体子任务，通过LLM进行二元分类评估，并以人类专家的评分作为参照进行对比。

Result: 最优模型的F1得分达到0.83，研究发现模型在工具使用能力较强时与人类专家表现更接近，且模型在评判一些任务时表现差异，这表明不同模型适合不同的评估任务。此外，弱模型能够评估强模型的渗透测试轨迹，证明验证难度低于生成任务。

Conclusion: 提出的评估方法为AI信息安全代理的全面和可扩展的质量评价提供了新路径，同时降低了在敏感环境中应用AI安全代理的风险。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

TL;DR: AQUAH提出了首个基于语言的水文建模端到端智能代理，能从自然语言提示生成仿真并制作报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统水文建模流程繁琐、门槛高的问题，简化数据获取和模型配置。

Method: 结合大语言模型和视觉技术，通过解释地图和栅格数据，自动完成数据检索、模型配置、仿真和报告生成。

Result: 在美国几个流域的初步测试中，AQUAH能在无需人工干预的情况下完成冷启动仿真并生成清晰透明的文档。

Conclusion: AQUAH展现了LLM与视觉结合在简化环境建模及数据与决策之间桥梁的重要潜力，但需进一步校准和验证以实际部署。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

Motivation: 多模态语言模型在自动医学影像解读中有潜力，但受限于其在基础感知任务上的错误表现，需要提高其视觉感知能力以促进临床应用。

Method: 设计了Medblink基准，包括8个临床相关任务（多种影像和解剖学区域），共包含1,429道多选题和1,605幅影像，评估了19种MLMs在这些任务中的表现。

Result: 人类注解者的准确率为96.4%，最佳模型仅达到65%，显示当前MLMs在例行感知检查中经常失败。

Conclusion: 现有多模态语言模型需要强化视觉基础能力，以推进其在临床环境中的接受与应用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖标注数据构建和优化工作流，在动态真实场景中不灵活和无效的问题。

Method: 提出一种动态分层工作流方案，结合任务流程图的灵活性和代码工作流的表达能力，使用多网格图优化和自反思指导的进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在编码、数学和多轮QA任务的六个基准数据集上，Polymath比现有最优方法平均提高8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath成功展示了无需标注数据优化工作流解决动态实际问题的能力，并在多领域基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统依赖外部分类器的方法的局限性，利用LLM自身推理能力进行自我保护。

Method: 引入Meta-Cognitive和Arbitration模块框架，使LLM能自主评估和调节输出。

Result: 在7种LLM上进行实验，使用AdvBench和Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024数据集，显著提高防御成功率，部分模型在增强模式下几乎达到完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅轻量化且成本效益高，还提升了LLM的伦理性，可用于多个GenAI平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs生态系统分散，工具集成复杂且开发工作量大。

Method: 采用协议无关的设计原则，包含自动化模式生成、双模并发执行、多源工具管理等。

Result: 在集成场景下减少60-80%的代码，优化并发性能提高至3.1倍，兼容现有标准。

Conclusion: 该方法减少开发开销，提升性能，理论与实践并重，适用于LLM应用开发。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的能力及自主性快速增长，评估这些模型输出质量的需求日益迫切。

Method: 通过综述方式，定义了'AI代理作为评估者'的概念，并探讨其演化、优势与不足。

Result: 提出了多种AI代理评估方法的比较和在实际领域中的应用案例，同时指出其局限性。

Conclusion: AI代理可作为人类评估的有益补充，但无法完全取代人类，在可靠性、偏见和评价机制上仍有挑战需解决。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出BPO框架，以解决大型语言模型在交互环境中的推理和计划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在静态任务表现优异，但在交互环境中的多回合规划面临稀疏奖励问题和历史记录计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出BPO框架，包括三个阶段：引导初步推理、通过复杂度分层课程学习拓展任务范围、通过奖励驱动采样进行模型自我优化。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop的实验中，新方法在效果和计算效率上均达到当前最佳。

Conclusion: BPO框架为稀疏奖励环境中的长期推理和计划提供了一种高效的新方案。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于多智能体的框架Collab-Solver，通过协同优化MILP多个模块的策略提升求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的MILP方法忽略了各模块之间的相互依赖性，从而影响了求解速度和质量。

Method: 引入Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习框架实现策略的协同优化：第一阶段完成数据沟通的策略预训练，第二阶段协调各模块策略学习。

Result: 提出的策略显著改进了在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上的求解性能，同时体现了跨实例集的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协同方法结合多个模块的策略学习，提高了MILP求解的效率和质量，展示其有效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT-2能高效学习元-ODE算法，其表现可与Euler方法相当，并随着示例数量的增加获得指数级精度提升，同时展现出对OOD问题的稳健性和外推能力。

Conclusion: 实验表明，ICL不仅可解释大语言模型在NLP任务中的行为，还展示了其解决非线性数值问题的潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在处理真实世界中复杂的医学诊断任务时表现不足，主要因为缺乏充分的推理深度，从而导致信息丢失或逻辑跳跃，造成诊断错误。

Method: 设计了Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR)多代理框架，引入树结构用于清晰记录推理路径及对应的临床证据，并通过交叉验证机制提升多代理决策的一致性和推理能力。

Result: 在真实的医学数据实验中，ToR框架表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR)框架能够有效提高大语言模型应对复杂医学诊断任务的能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）越狱攻击的防御框架，名为Cognitive-Driven Defense（CDD），展现了在已知和未知攻击中的突出防御表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法主要依赖浅层的模式匹配，难以应对新颖且未见过的攻击策略，迫切需要一种更鲁棒的防御机制。

Method: 提出CDD框架，通过模拟人类的认知推理链，结合全局感知与局部分析识别隐藏的攻击操作，同时引入基于熵的强化学习算法（EG-GRPO）探索未知威胁。

Result: 实验表明，CDD在已知与未知的越狱攻击防守中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CDD不仅能够有效防御已知的攻击模式，还具备对新型攻击的一定的泛化能力，提供了安全可靠的LLMs防御方案。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ContractEval，这是首个评估开源大型语言模型（LLM）在商业合同中识别法律风险能力的基准。测试了4个专有模型和15个开源模型，指出开源模型需进一步优化来接近专有模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开源LLM在法律风险分析领域的潜力，特别是在确保数据保密的本地部署背景下。

Method: 利用Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset（CUAD），评估了4个专有LLM和15个开源LLM在合同条款级别法律风险识别中的表现。

Result: 研究发现：1. 专有模型整体表现优于开源模型。2. 更大的开源模型通常表现更好，但成长逐渐放缓。3. 推理模式提高了效果性，但降低了准确性。4. 开源模型更倾向于生成“无相关条款”的回答。5. 模型量化提高推理速度，但降低准确性。

Conclusion: 尽管大部分LLM的表现相当于初级法律助理，开源模型需通过针对性微调来提高可靠性和效果性。ContractEval为未来法律领域LLM的发展提供了良好基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的自动启发式设计（AHD）方法通常设计单一启发式，导致在不同问题分布或设置下泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出了一种新的问题表述AHSD，并设计进化启发式集（EoH-S）方法，包括互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索机制，以生成高质量互补启发式集合。

Result: 实验表明，在三类不同AHD任务上，EoH-S显著优于现有最优方法，性能提升最高达60%。

Conclusion: EoH-S能够有效解决多样化问题实例的优化需求，为自动化启发式设计提供了一种更泛化和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Conclusion: MissDDIM通过改进的扩散模型克服了传统方法的缺陷，为表格数据插补提供了一种更快且稳定的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练框架依赖包含私人用户数据的网络抓取数据集，引发隐私和数据保护问题，并且现有不可学习例子的生成方法需要暴露数据，存在隐私矛盾。

Method: 本文提出T2UE框架，使用文本到图像（T2I）模型将文本描述映射到图像噪声空间，同时结合误差最小化框架生成有效的不可学习噪声，从而无需原始数据即可生成保护数据。

Result: 实验表明，T2UE保护的数据显著降低了最先进模型在下游任务（如跨模态检索）中的性能，且其保护效果在不同架构及有监督学习设置中具有普适性。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了基于文本描述的“零接触数据保护”，克服了隐私暴露的矛盾，为数据隐私保护提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Motivation: 教育环境复杂，传统模型在处理个性化教学和人类复杂认知行为方面存在不足，急需设计适用于智能教育的生成式代理模型。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的统一生成式代理架构AgentSME，具备Solo、Mono和Echo三种交互通信模式，并通过准确性和多样性指标进行模型评估。

Result: 六种LLM的测试表明，Echo通信模式的生成代理在准确性上表现最佳，DeepSeek模式在推理多样性上有最高得分。

Conclusion: AgentSME的研究为改进模型学习能力提供了重要参考，并为智能教育的发展提供了新启发。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Conclusion: 虽然AI可以在环境教育中提供支持，但其应用仍需与人类专家的洞察相结合。

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
models to bridge the knowledge gap in environmental education among university
students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,

Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在进行正式几何推理时存在困难，尤其是在动态构建和验证辅助几何元素方面。

Method: 提出Geoint-R1框架，结合了辅助元素构造、基于Lean4的正式推理和交互式可视化。此外，开发Geoint基准测试集，涵盖多种几何主题，并包含结构化文本标注及专家验证的解答步骤。

Conclusion: Geoint-R1显著提高了几何推理能力，并通过Geoint基准测试集推动了形式化几何推理的研究。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments

encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting

Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of
learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with
Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with

*Osama Mohammed,Jiaxin Pan,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Daniel Hernández,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的时间图方法，名为Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet)，利用完整历史图捕捉实体的时间动态交互关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统时间序列预测无法处理的实体间“谁与谁在何时交互”的问题，在轨迹预测和金融欺诈检测等任务中存在实际需求。

Method: 提出了一种完整历史图模型，将实体每个时间步视为单独节点，区分时间内和跨时间步的两类边，并设计ETDNet模型，分别通过图注意力模块、多头时间注意力模块和融合模块学习信息。

Result: ETDNet在驾驶意图预测和比特币欺诈检测任务中显著优于基线模型：Waymo数据集的联合准确率达到75.6%，Elliptic++数据集的非法类别F1分数提升至88.1%。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明，区分结构关系和时间变化的边表现形式可以提升时间图学习任务的性能。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ToolVQA，一个23K实例的大规模多模态数据集，专注于复杂工具使用和多步推理任务，显著提升了现实场景下LFMs的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方案在工具增强的视觉问答任务中表现实强，但在需要多步推理的真实场景中存在不足，亟需改进。

Method: 引入ToolVQA数据集，通过一种名为ToolEngine的数据生成管道，利用深度优先搜索（DFS）和动态语境示例匹配机制，模拟人类的工具使用逻辑。

Result: 通过ToolVQA微调的7B LFMs在测试数据集上表现优异，并在多个分布外（OOD）数据集上超越了GPT-3.5-turbo，显示出很强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToolVQA提高了LFMs在真实情境下的工具应用能力，填补了现存基准在多模态和多步推理方面的空白，对未来增强LFMs能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

TL;DR: Nemori是一种新颖的自组织记忆架构，灵感来自人类认知原则，解决了当前大语言模型在长时间交互中的记忆限制问题，在长时间上下文表现上显著优于前沿系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内存系统存在基本记忆单元粒度和基于规则提取知识的局限性，难以支持长时间的动态交互。

Method: Nemori架构包含两大创新：1. "两步对齐原则"，依据事件分段理论，自主组织会话为语义连贯的片段；2. "预测-校准原则"，根据自由能原则，通过预测差距实现主动学习。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准实验中，Nemori显著超越现有最佳系统，尤其在长上下文场景中优势突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长期动态工作流处理提供了有效的解决方案，有助于实现真正的知识进化和长期记忆保持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Motivation: 随着像ChatGPT和Claude这样的LLM的兴起，实时任务处理的AI代理需求增加，但传统云端部署引入了显著的延迟。边缘部署可以提高效率，但资源有限和异构环境带来了巨大挑战。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于边缘智能系统的AI代理部署和迁移自适应框架，结合蚁群算法和基于LLM的优化模型，以在资源限制和延迟/成本之间进行高效决策。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地解决了动态边缘环境中LLM驱动AI代理的部署和管理问题，提供了一种高效且轻量的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于步骤熵的新方法，用于压缩大语言模型中的链式逻辑推理 (CoT) 内容，以减少推理冗余并提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在复杂推理中表现强劲，但其冗长的推理过程导致推理效率较低，资源消耗增加，亟需一种方法来实现内容简化。

Method: 利用步骤熵作为衡量推理步骤信息量的指标，通过剪枝低熵步骤减少冗余，并进一步采用监督微调 (SFT) 与组相对策略优化 (GRPO) 的双阶段训练方法，引导模型在推理中生成压缩版的CoT。

Result: 实验表明，可剪枝约80%的低熵中间步骤而仅对答案准确性产生轻微影响。同时，与随机剪枝或高熵剪枝相比，低熵剪枝更能维护推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在显著提升推理效率的同时保持准确性，对于大语言模型实际部署和推理结构的理解具有重要的启发意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨语言和跨场景应用中缺乏通用性，限制了其实用价值，因此需要更通用的评估体系。

Method: 设计了一套统一的多模态评估流程，并使用LLMs进行链式提示和LoRA轻量级微调，测试其跨数据集和跨语言性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs通过适当微调和提示优化，可以成为跨语言和跨场景的高效认知障碍评估工具，推动临床应用。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Conclusion: 混合方法是发展通用逻辑推理的更优路径，并提出基于此方法的一种模块化、通用性强且无需大量人工输入的框架。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

TL;DR: 提出UML2Dep框架，从形式化规格出发生成复杂系统代码，解决语言描述中的歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成代码时受到模糊语言描述的限制，难以处理复杂系统需求如条件逻辑、结构关系和服务依赖性。

Method: 提出UML2Dep框架，包括增强UML序列图形式化复杂需求，定义数据依赖推导任务，将其形式化为数学推理任务，并引入静态解析和依赖修剪方法。

Result: 通过使用明确的复杂需求和减少推理复杂度，UML2Dep改进了LLMs在代码生成中的精度与效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep通过形式化规格和推导技术解决语言歧义问题，增强了生成代码的可靠性与性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

### [224] [Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis for Routing Problems Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03406)
*Kai Li,Ruihao Zheng,Xinye Hao,Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个多目标不可行性诊断方法（MOID），结合大语言模型和多目标优化，为自动路径求解器提供可行性修复建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在路径优化问题中，由于用户提出的条件矛盾或过于严格，导致模型难以求解。目前方法对调整不可行模型的响应不足。

Method: 方法结合多目标优化和大语言模型，生成包含约束修改的潜在解决方案，并通过分析函数为不可行问题提供多样化的诊断建议。

Result: 在50种不可行路径问题的实验中，MOID生成了多个诊断建议，相较其他方法，显著提升了可行性修复和决策效率。

Conclusion: MOID通过单次运行生成多样化诊断建议，为不可行模型的问题求解和决策过程提供了更实用的支持。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

*Taine J. Elliott,Stephen P. Levitt,Ken Nixon,Martin Bekker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于大语言模型（LLM）的信息提取与知识图谱生成方法，解决医学文献信息繁杂的问题，测试了从44篇PubMed摘要提取并验证知识的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医学数据和文献的迅速增长，研究人员和临床医生难以及时有效地跟踪和应用最新发现，需要一种自动化工具对信息进行提炼和关联。

Method: 建立了一条利用LLM代理的管道，将PubMed摘要分解为语义相关句子，提取知识图谱三元组并结合本体类别提升其语义信息，同时加入上下文变量拓展为‘四元组’，并通过句子相似性验证提取的准确性。

Result: 提取的四元组平均余弦相似度达0.874，与普通三元组相比，加入上下文变量后的相似性有所提高，同时验证了LLM在知识推理与连接方面的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时更新的医学知识中心提供了可能性，并为其他领域的类似深度知识整合开辟了新路径，具有广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用加权有向图表述信念系统的形式化方法，以更好地表示信念之间的内部结构和关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信念系统的表示方式经常忽视内部结构冲突、不一致状态，难以描述复杂的知识形态。

Method: 引入加权有向图形式化：节点代表单个信念，边表示信念间的支持或矛盾关系，并分别定义每个信念的可信度和信心度。方法不假设先验一致性，也不涉及推理或更新程序。

Result: 提供了一种静态框架，可以用于分析信念系统的组织方式，识别逻辑结构和存在的张力。

Conclusion: 相比现有方法，该形式化方法在不假设一致性的条件下，能够更细致地刻画信念系统的多种状态，具备更强的分类和分析能力。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: 通过提出SmartGen框架，解决了智能家居模型因行为漂移导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因行为漂移引起的模型性能下降问题，同时避免了因收集新的行为数据带来的高成本和隐私问题。

Method: 提出一种四部分组成的LLM框架：时间与语义感知分割模块、语义感知序列压缩、图引导的序列合成、两阶段异常值过滤，用于生成符合上下文变化的用户行为数据。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，SmartGen在行为漂移条件下显著提升了异常检测（平均提高85.43%）和行为预测（平均提高70.51%）的性能。

Conclusion: SmartGen有效解决了行为漂移问题，提升了智能家居模型的准确性，其生成的行为数据具备较高的语义一致性和行为真实性。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在推理过程中产生错误、幻觉和格式问题，特别是面对数学表达式生成的挑战。

Method: 提出了EDCIM方法，用LLM生成方程系统，通过符号化错误检测框架识别错误并提供修正反馈，同时平衡开源与专有模型以优化效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，EDCIM在正确配置权衡参数后，可显著降低计算和财务成本，同时维持甚至提高预测精度。

Conclusion: EDCIM成功在可解释性数学任务中显著改进了大语言模型的精度与效率，为相关领域提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer模型中出现的‘大激活’现象的动态演变过程，并建立了数学模型预测其模式与行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大激活被认为是Transformer模型功能运行的关键，但其训练过程中的动态演化规律仍然缺乏深入研究。

Method: 通过分析不同规模的Pythia模型的训练过程，作者提出用指数调制对数函数建模大激活的行为，并使用机器学习预测关键参数。

Result: 作者成功构建了高精度预测框架，能够较好地预测稳定状态下的大激活行为，以及中等精度预测其时间和幅度。

Conclusion: 大激活的出现可由模型设计决定，并在训练开始前进行预测和调整，从而对模型稳定性、训练周期、可解释性和优化产生显著影响。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在处理含错误前提的输入时，如何应对代码生成中的缺陷及相关问题。

Method: 提出FPBench评估框架，通过构建三种错误前提类别，融合多维评估指标，对15个代表性LLM进行深入分析。

Result: 研究发现：（1）大多数模型在错误前提下表现出推理能力差的现象；（2）资源投入的回报递减，提示增加输入长度未必提升生成质量；（3）三类错误前提激活不同缺陷模式，揭示代码生成的三重认知分离。

Conclusion: 强调LLMs需在代码生成中主动验证前提，并通过FPBench框架和多维评估建立可信赖的模型开发理论基础及实践路径。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Motivation: 现有方法如匹配滤波和深度神经网络由于各自的缺点，在引力波信号检测中存在局限性。

Method: 设计了Evo-MCTS框架，结合树状搜索、进化优化和大语言模型启发，生成可解释的算法解决方案。

Result: 在MLGWSC-1基准测试中，检测性能相比最先进算法提高20.2%，并发现了新的算法组合。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅改进了引力波信号识别，还展示了一种具备可迁移性的自动化算法发现方法。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Conclusion: Agent Lightning框架表明，基于RL的LLM训练可以通过有效解耦与规范化设计，无痛适配多种代理，从而提升现实AI代理的性能与部署能力。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

Motivation: 现有混合PEFT方法在微调大语言模型应用于专门化任务时，存在无法量化不确定性和难以动态适应新数据的主要挑战。

Method: 提出BH-PEFT方法，将Adapter、LoRA与prefix-tuning相结合，通过对可学习参数进行分布建模实现贝叶斯学习并支持动态数据适应。

Result: 在情感分析、新闻分类和常识推理等业务任务上，BH-PEFT优于现有PEFT基线模型，能够量化不确定性，提高动态场景中的适应性。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT方法在业务分析和数据科学领域具有重大贡献，可用于支持不确定性感知和动态适应的决策任务，尤其适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究基于深度学习技术预测2025 NCAA一级篮球锦标赛结果，重点对比了LSTM与Transformer模型，发现前者在概率校准上表现更佳，而后者在分类性能上更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过深度学习改进体育预测模型的准确性与可靠性，特别是在篮球比赛领域中的实践应用，为未来相关领域提供参考框架。

Method: 基于历史比赛数据，通过LSTM和Transformer两种模型进行预测，同时引入综合特征工程，包括GLM、Elo评分、种子差异和统计汇总数据，模型训练采用BCE和Brier损失函数以评估分类性能与概率校准。

Result: Transformer模型在BCE优化下获得了最高AUC（0.8473），而LSTM模型在Brier损失优化下获得最低Brier分数（0.1589）。

Conclusion: 不同模型架构和损失函数的选择应针对预测任务具体需求进行权衡，该分析流程为体育数据分析提供了可重复的框架。

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics
and beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强的概率建模框架，用于准确模拟FeFETs的随机性及变异性，基于混合密度网络(MDN)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFETs在存储和逻辑技术方面具有潜力，但其操作周期和制造随机性带来的变异性给建模带来了挑战。

Method: 提出一个基于混合密度网络(MDN)的框架，结合C无穷连续激活函数和设备特定嵌入层，用于捕获设备固有的物理变异性。

Result: 模型在捕获FeFETs电流行为的变异性上表现出很高的准确性，R2达到0.92。

Conclusion: 该框架为全面建模FeFETs的随机行为及未来紧凑模型开发与电路仿真集成提供了基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的时空模型MinConvLSTM和MinConvGRU，结合了卷积递归网络的空间归纳偏和高效训练的RNN特点，显著提高了性能并减少了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ConvRNN模型在训练时需要顺序更新隐藏状态，导致训练效率受限。该研究旨在通过提出新的模型架构，实现并行化训练并保留空间建模能力。

Method: 研究利用MinLSTM和MinGRU的对数域前缀和公式，将其扩展到卷积架构中，结合并行化训练，并引入了一种基于xLSTM的指数门控机制以简化计算。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes动力学和真实世界的地势数据的两个时空预测任务中，新模型不仅显著提升了训练速度，还在闭环自回归模式下表现出了更低的预测误差。

Conclusion: 通过将简化的递归结构与卷积输入聚合相结合，所提出的模型在时空序列建模中提供了一种高效而结构简单的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB
control.

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich
structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering
spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance
of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large
pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken
from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas
Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that
pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly
sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural
network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms.
We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an

traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

*Yi Zhao,Yajuan Peng,Cam-Tu Nguyen,Zuchao Li,Xiaoliang Wang,Hai Zhao,Xiaoming Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SmallKV通过设计两个对比机制来解决现有KV缓存逐出方法中的问题，显著提升了性能并提高了LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存逐出方法无法适应解码过程中动态的注意力模式，且无法合理区分边际重要的token和真正不重要的token，限制了性能表现。

Method: 通过利用不同规模LLM之间注意力矩阵的高相似性，设计了SmallKV方法，借助小模型辅助实现KV缓存压缩补偿机制。

Result: 实验表明，SmallKV在GSM8K、BBH、MT-Bench和LongBench等基准上都表现出色，并且效率提高了1.75至2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境中提供了一种高效且性能优越的LLM推理方法，具有很大的应用潜力。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了动态多尺度协调框架（DMSC），解决时间序列预测中的复杂依赖建模问题，并取得了优异结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法在静态分解策略、分散的依赖建模和不灵活的融合机制上存在问题，限制了对复杂时间依赖关系的有效建模。

Method: 提出一种Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework（DMSC），包括三个核心模块：动态多尺度分解块（EMPD），用于调整输入序列分层分块；三元交互块（TIB），建模多种依赖关系；以及自适应尺度路由MoE块（ASR-MoE），实现动态融合多个尺度的预测。

Result: 在十三个真实数据基准上的实验表明，DMSC在时间序列预测任务中达到了最新的技术水平（SOTA），并具有卓越的计算效率。

Conclusion: DMSC框架通过动态分解、联合依赖建模和灵活融合，提高了时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型使用单一的文本嵌入，不能充分捕捉输入文本的多样语义特性。

Method: 引入多种结构化提示，每种提示包含一个独特的自适应标记，通过单次前向传播产生丰富的文本表示，并结合多样性正则损失和否定感知损失来提高表示的语义多样性和对比区分能力。

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索基准测试中取得了一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过多提示嵌入和多样性损失方法，可实现更加丰富语义的视觉与文本对齐。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Result: SEM方法在处理大范围分布偏移时，比传统方法更准确，评估更精确且学习到较低方差的策略。

Conclusion: 如果模型足够精确，SEM方法可以学得最优策略，解决当前方法的保守性不足。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

Result: TIC GRPO具备无偏策略梯度估计，并保留了GRPO的无价值函数结构；性能与标准GRPO相当。

Conclusion: 提出的TIC GRPO算法解决了GRPO中的偏差问题，提高了策略梯度估计的准确性，并显示出良好的实用价值和理论支持。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种将生物学启发与物理学结合，适应性强、高效的抗体优化新范式，适合多种医疗应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法切实提升了 RAG 系统的安全性，在保证生成效果的情况下有效防御了攻击。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效地在资源受限情况下实现高效、准确的漏洞评估，优于最先进方法。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of

### [253] [Comparative Evaluation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Autoencoders and Orthogonal Autoencoders for Fault Detection with Varying Training Set Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02860)
*Enrique Luna Villagómez,Vladimir Mahalec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)的四种变体在无监督故障检测中的应用，并将其与正交自编码器(OAE)进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索KANs在无监督化学过程故障检测中的应用潜力，尤其是在数据有限的情况下推动高效故障检测的能力。

Method: 采用KAN-AE（基于EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, WavKAN的实现）进行故障检测，并以FDR为指标在Tennessee Eastman Process上与OAE基线比较。

Result: WavKAN-AE表现最佳，使用4000样本即可达到≥92%的FDR；EfficientKAN-AE在仅500样本下达≥90%的FDR；FastKAN-AE在样本多时表现竞争性；FourierKAN-AE表现欠佳；OAE需要更多数据才能接近KAN-AE性能。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs在数据效率和故障检测性能方面展现了优异表现，同时基础函数的结构化设计提高了模型透明性，适合部署在数据有限的工业环境中。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新型混合神经符号架构，能较传统回归方法更有效处理非对称结构噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稳健回归方法在处理非对称结构噪声时表现较差，需要新的技术解决此问题。

Method: 利用混合神经符号架构，其中transformer编码器处理数据序列，一个压缩神经网络预测符号参数，通过固定符号方程重建原始序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，其模型的回归MSE达到6e-6至3.5e-5，比传统方法提升10至300倍。

Conclusion: 提出方法能有效处理非对称结构噪声，在稳健回归任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Motivation: 为了减少大规模真实序列数据收集的成本，作者希望通过生成合成数据来提高TSFM的预训练效率。

Method: CauKer结合了高斯过程(GP)核以及结构因果模型(SCM)，生成具有现实性趋势、季节性和非线性互动的合成时间序列，用于支持不同架构和预训练方式的TSFM预训练。

Result: 实验表明，与真实数据相比，CauKer生成的数据展现了更明确的扩展规律，无论是在数据集规模（10K到10M样本）还是模型容量（1M到783M参数）方面都有显著优势。

Conclusion: CauKer为TSFM的高效预训练提供了新方法，展现了优于真实世界数据的扩展特性，为模型训练带来了新的可能性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Conclusion: 正交雅可比矩阵方法显著提升了稳定性和深度网络可训练性，且可以扩展到广泛的网络类别中。

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了物理可解释性、边缘部署效率以及实时控制能力，验证了其优势。

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Conclusion: 该研究通过利用集群结构优化了多臂老虎机问题，提出的Clus-UCB算法在理论和模拟中表现优异，但也存在部分局限性，为未来工作提供了研究方向。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

Conclusion: PLoRA显著提升了LoRA微调过程中的资源利用效率和性能，为大语言模型的高效微调提供了新方案。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新的实践路径，并为DRMGs的在线学习设立了重要的理论基石。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 新方法兼顾快速性和内存效率，提高了反问题求解的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Conclusion: 本文提出的单阶段框架，通过新的预训练与推理方式显著提升了城市特征预测的效果，证明了自监督学习在城市数据建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合MRI图像、认知评估和生物标记的多模态框架，用于早期检测阿尔茨海默症（AD），结果显示更高的诊断准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前诊断方法多依赖单一数据模式，难以全面捕捉AD的复杂特性，导致早期检测困难，治疗延迟，效果不佳。

Method: 整合MRI成像、认知评估和生物标记数据，利用CNN分析MRI图像，使用LSTM处理认知和生物标记数据，并通过加权平均等技术实现多模态结果的聚合，增强诊断准确性。

Result: 框架通过多模态方式显著提高检测过程的鲁棒性，尤其通过整合认知测试和生物标记实现更早期的AD识别。

Conclusion: 研究表明，所提出的框架能革新AD的早期检测，助力更及时和更有效的治疗干预。

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VRPO的强化学习框架，通过增强价值模型来处理噪声问题，提升了策略优化的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对RLHF在噪声或不完善奖励监督下政策不稳定性和泛化能力差的问题，探讨了价值模型在减少噪声中的重要性。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，包括基于冻结语言模型的熵与困惑度指导的辅助损失和变分信息瓶颈两部分设计，用以增强价值模型对噪声的过滤能力及关键上下文词的捕捉能力。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和多轮对话等任务中，无论是基于规则的还是基于模型的噪声奖励，VRPO都显著优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 价值模型在RLHF中的作用被低估，该工作提供了一种理论和实践结合的方法，能在噪声环境下实现稳健的政策优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Motivation: 多项逻辑带有多个输出结果的决策问题在实际中非常常见，但现有算法对有限适应性条件支持不足，限制了其可行性。

Method: 提出了两种算法：B-MNL-CB用于批量更新的场景，RS-MNL用于少次策略切换的场景；分别实现分布最优设计和适应性策略更新。

Result: 在实验中，两种算法在只进行固定数量的策略更新下表现出对比最优状态下同等甚至更优的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在保留理论最优遗憾界的同时，大幅降低了策略更新次数，在实际场景中具有良好的适用性。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的对比学习方法无法有效处理文本属性超图中的三大局限，包括图无关文本编码器未能捕捉图拓扑信息、随机数据增强引入噪声以及当前方法难以捕捉长距离依赖关系。

Method: HiTeC采用两阶段设计，包括图结构感知的文本编码器预训练和语义感知的增强策略（如提示增强文本增广和语义感知超边删除），结合多尺度对比损失以捕捉长距离依赖。

Result: 实验表明，HiTeC在可扩展性和表现力方面优于现有的CL方法，有效解决了文本属性超图的处理问题。

Conclusion: HiTeC框架通过解耦文本编码器与超图对比学习流程，在提升可扩展性的同时保持了良好的表示学习效果，对未来文本属性图的研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

TL;DR: 分析了SGDM在动态学习率和批量大小调度下的收敛行为，提出了一种新的Lyapunov函数，并验证了动态调度的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更全面地理解带动量的随机梯度下降算法（SGDM）在不同调度策略下的行为，提供理论基础以优化深度学习训练过程。

Method: 通过引入一种新型Lyapunov函数，分析了SGDM在三种常用动态调度策略（学习率和批量大小）的收敛性，并通过实验验证了理论。

Result: 揭示了不同调度策略下的收敛行为差异，动态调度（特别是批量大小和学习率同时增加的策略）在收敛速度和稳定性上有明显优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为现代深度学习中的高效稳定训练提供了统一的理论基础和实用指导，动态调整超参数优于固定超参数。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Motivation: 现有方法对特征空间假设严格，限制了ID与OOD样本的可分性，因此需要更自然的框架改进。

Method: 利用伪标签诱导子空间表示，结合交叉熵分类损失和子空间距离正则化损失，构建新的OOD检测框架。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了该框架的OOD检测效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架放宽了以往方法的假设条件，提高了ID与OOD样本的分离能力，推动了稳健人工智能领域的发展。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算图编辑距离是NP难问题，而现有基于神经网络的方法通常简化问题假设单一成本操作，这在实际中不现实，因此需要开发更灵活可解释的方法。

Method: 该方法结合监督和无监督训练，在无监督情况下引入梯度仅自组织机制优化。在模型架构中，整合了广义加性模型，能够上下文感知地灵活学习编辑成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法能够达到与当前顶尖参考方法相似的性能，但显著提升了适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅在性能上与现有方法匹敌，还因灵活的成本函数学习提供了对复杂图结构的洞察，特别适用于分子分析和结构模式发现等领域。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种被称为RegMean++的新方法，改进了现有的模型融合方法RegMean，通过显式引入层内和层间依赖来优化融合表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RegMean方法虽然高效，但忽略了模型层间信息的相关性，导致融合精度有限。为了弥补这一缺陷，本文提出改进方法。

Method: RegMean++在RegMean的基础上，通过引入显式的层内及跨层依赖，优化预测误差目标，从而更准确地捕捉融合模型的行为特性。

Result: 实验证明，RegMean++在域内、跨域泛化、顺序融合、大规模任务及分布转变下的鲁棒性等方面都优于RegMean。此外，其性能达到了当前模型融合领域的领先水平。

Conclusion: RegMean++不仅改进了模型融合的精度和稳定性，还在多个场景下展现了较强的通用性，验证了其在实际应用中的价值。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Frontier是一个适用于新兴复杂语言模型推理场景的高保真模拟器，提升了模拟准确性与实用性，为社区优化大型模型推理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers
the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

Motivation: 探讨gpt-oss开放模型在极端情况下的潜在风险，以及评估其释放是否合理。

Method: 采用恶意微调（MFT），通过训练gpt-oss在生物学领域的威胁创造任务和网络安全领域的攻防任务（例如CTF），以激发模型的最大能力。同时，与其他开放和闭源语言模型进行了对比分析。

Result: 在生物和网络安全领域的评估中，MFT调优后的gpt-oss性能低于某些顶级闭源模型（如OpenAI o3），并且能力提升在现有开放模型中并无显著前进。

Conclusion: 综合这些研究结果，作者决定释放该模型，并期望MFT方法能为未来评估开放模型的潜在风险提供指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable
property valuations.

Motivation: 现有的状态空间模型过于依赖启发式选择机制，缺乏严谨的理论基础，且可能不够稳健。

Method: 基于“预测充分性原理”，设计了一个目标函数，用于指导模型选择机制，优化信息压缩和预测性能。

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上的长期预测和噪声场景下表现优于现有模型。同时，其原则能拓展为提升其他架构的正则化方法。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优异且更加稳健，所提出的理论框架展现出广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Conclusion: CoTox展示了LLM框架在药物毒性早期评估中的潜力，提供了更高的解释性和实际应用前景。

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the

TL;DR: 允许用户调整机器学习模型预测可以减少对算法决策的排斥感，但透明性的影响并不显著，两者的作用是独立的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在引入可解释机器学习模型的情况下，预测可调整性和透明性如何影响用户对算法决策的接受度。

Method: 开展了一项有280名参与者的预注册用户研究，测试可调整性和透明性对算法排斥的综合影响。

Result: 结果表明，可调整性仍有助于减少算法排斥感，但透明性影响较小且在样本中不显著，两者的作用之间相对独立。

Conclusion: 提供调整选项可有效缓解算法排斥感，而透明性虽然重要，但其实际影响可能有限，需进一步研究两者的交互作用。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在克服传统神经网络对数据密集和“黑箱”模型的依赖，提供一种基于物理意义的透明替代方案。

Method: 通过Pade近似和Lanczos算法，在无需反向传播和高维嵌入的情况下，将时间域信号转化为稀疏的、物理意义明确的频谱表示。随后利用核投影函数将其映射为符号谓词，通过规则引擎实现逻辑推理。

Result: 在时间序列异常检测、符号分类和混合推理任务中，该架构提供了具有竞争力的精度，同时保持了解释性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该架构展示了一种结合数学物理、稀疏近似理论和符号AI的机器学习新方向，具备物理驱动和推理能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

### [284] [Adaptive Sparse Softmax: An Effective and Efficient Softmax Variant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03175)
*Qi Lv,Lei Geng,Ziqiang Cao,Min Cao,Sujian Li,Wenjie Li,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Adaptive Sparse Softmax (AS-Softmax)的方法，以解决传统Softmax存在的训练过度和测试目标匹配问题，并通过适应性梯度累积策略显著加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax由于目标分数无法达到1，训练过程可能无限延续且易导致过拟合，同时当前训练目标过于耗费时间在已正确分类的样本上，与实际测试需求不符。

Method: 通过AS-Softmax设计出与测试目标匹配的合理变换，忽略分数较低的类别，聚焦目标类与主要竞争对手之间的学习；同时根据被屏蔽样本比例开发了一种自适应梯度累积策略。

Result: AS-Softmax在文本分类、图像分类、音频分类等任务中均表现优于Softmax及其变种，并且实现了1.2倍的训练加速，同时保持了分类的有效性。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax不仅在性能上表现出色，还通过自适应梯度累积策略提升了训练效率，是对传统Softmax的重要改进。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文综述了深度强化学习领域中Scaling Laws的应用，系统分析了数据、网络和训练预算三方面的扩展策略及其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Scaling Laws在计算机视觉和自然语言处理中展现了显著效果，但在深度强化学习中却未被充分探索，其潜力值得研究。

Method: 本文从数据、网络和训练预算三方面分析Scaling Laws在深度强化学习中的应用：数据扩展借助并行采样和生成，网络扩展涉及结构增强及多代理方法，训练预算扩展则关注分布式训练和辅助学习等策略。

Result: 本文阐明了数据、网络和训练预算扩展策略在提升学习表现中的协同作用，并明确了其在深度强化学习决策优化中的具体优势。

Conclusion: 本文为未来的深度强化学习研究提供了路线图，强调在提升扩展性的同时需兼顾计算效率，并指出其在机器人控制、自动驾驶及大模型训练等领域的潜在应用方向。

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Method: 提出一个简单的分析框架，研究采样过程中的离散化、初始化和评分估计误差，首次推导出Heun采样器的Wasserstein收敛界，并改进了Euler采样器的相关结果。

Result: 强调了学习到的评分函数的空间正则性的重要性，并引入了平滑化Wasserstein距离的最新结果来优化初始化误差界。

Conclusion: 通过所提出的框架，进一步看到了控制评分误差与真实逆过程一致可以提升模型的性能，并支持降噪评分匹配方法的合理性。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Conclusion: 研究表明，神经网络的有限深度对平衡分离性和鲁棒性至关重要，并揭示了神经网络动态的复杂性。

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器忘记方法缺乏统计保证，依赖启发式指标，并且计算成本高。因此，需要引入新的方法解决这些问题。

Method: 通过基于保形预测的框架引入新的忘记定义，提出了统计可靠的、面向不确定性的保障，设计了新的经验度量指标（ECF和EuCF）以及优化算法来评估和优化忘记效果。

Result: 实验表明，在多个遗忘场景、数据集和模型中，所提出的方法有效地去除了目标数据影响。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提高了忘记效果，还能以较低成本提供统计可靠性，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告竞价环境复杂，因不同广告主的预算及ROI目标差异大，现有的自动竞价解决方案在样本效率和约束泛化性上都有局限性。

Method: 提出HALO方法，通过引入理论支持的Hindsight机制，将探索数据重新定向为任意约束配置的训练数据；利用B样条函数实现可导的竞价映射，提高连续调整能力。

Result: 在工业数据集上的实验结果显示，HALO在处理多尺度约束方面具有明显优势，在减少约束违规的同时提升了GMV。

Conclusion: HALO为在线自动竞价提供了更高效的解决方案，具备强适应性，适用于多变的预算和ROI要求。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Motivation: 目前时间序列分类主要依赖深度学习模型，其输出难以解释，因此需要一种既能保证准确性又易于理解的解决方案。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法性能具有竞争力，同时提供了高质量的逻辑解释。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合分类性能与可解释性，为安全相关领域时间序列分类提供了解决新思路。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Result: 提出了一种包含Euclidean和Mahalanobis距离的通用框架，并为复杂随机向量的最优质心提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的alpha-beta散度新形式，为复杂数据的信号处理提供了理论支持，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

Motivation: 为了解决传统知识图谱嵌入模型（KGE）在迁移到超关系知识图谱（HKGs）时未知的性能来源问题，并克服当前HKG嵌入模型中的长距离依赖和信息压缩问题。

Method: 提出通过三种分解方法将HKGs的数据转化为传统KG形式，评估经典KGE模型在HKGs上的性能，然后设计FormerGNN框架，包括一个用于保留HKG拓扑结构的限定符整合方法，以及一个基于GNN的图编码器来捕捉长距离依赖，同时改进主三元组和限定符信息的整合方法。

Result: 实验表明，不同分解方法对HKG结构信息的保留能力有限，且理论和实验验证了FormerGNN在多个任务上都优于现有的HKG嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种新的FormerGNN架构，证明了其在捕捉HKG内长距离依赖和限定符整合方面的优势，为未来HKG研究提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Conclusion: 此研究为假设检验中的策略性互动提供了新视角，并在技术和监管方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

Conclusion: PINO框架能够实现广泛波浪条件下的鲁棒泛化，有望在实际海洋环境中推广用于操作性的数据驱动波浪重建和预测。

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

*He Xiao,Qingyao Yang,Dirui Xie,Wendong Xu,Wenyong Zhou,Haobo Liu,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LieQ量化框架，在低比特量化条件下保持小模型高精度并提升压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型的参数冗余严重，推理时无效贡献显著且资源消耗高，急需精确量化方案支撑边缘设备部署。

Method: 引入3种层级诊断指标用于量化调整：困惑度下降（Perplexity Drop）、表征紧凑性（Representational Compactness）和前k能量增益（Top-k Energy Gain），并实现自动比特分配无需梯度更新。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B上，LieQ在2.05-bit量化下恢复95.9%的FP16性能，比现有方法精度提升18%以上；在LLaMA3.2-3B上以2.07-bit量化实现4x内存节约，同时保持98.2%精度。

Conclusion: LieQ在极限内存条件下显著提升小型语言模型性能，为资源受限设备的高效部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法来从热脱附光谱（TDS）中直接预测氢捕获参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过TDS分析金属合金的氢捕获行为，但提取关键参数存在很大的挑战性。

Method: 建立了由两个多层全连接神经网络组成的模型，第一个网络进行分类以预测捕获类型数量，第二个网络进行回归以预测捕获密度和结合能。

Result: 模型在三种不同成分的回火马氏体钢上表现出强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: 通过优化神经网络结构和超参数，该模型实现了高效的训练数据使用和准确的参数预测。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

TL;DR: AI on the Pulse 是一套基于先进 AI 模型的实时健康异常检测系统，通过多种智能设备的融合，提升健康管理的效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗场景中难以实时监测和持续标注数据的问题，为家庭健康护理提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用 UniTS 通用时间序列模型，结合多种非侵入式传感器进行数据融合，基于异常检测而非分类的方式提供实时预测。

Result: 系统在高精度医疗设备（如 ECG）和消费级可穿戴设备中表现优异，在 F1 指标上比 12 种最新技术提高了约 22%。

Conclusion: 通过在家庭场景中成功部署，证明非临床设备也能实现高质量健康监测，并通过 LLM 转化异常评分为有意义的临床洞察，助力医疗决策。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体框架，结合AI生成、分子编辑和评分工具，优化药物分子设计，实现更快的循环周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前药物发现周期缓慢，主要因数据、专业知识和工具分散。本研究旨在通过自动化框架缩短分子优化周期。

Method: 建立一个多层级智能体框架，包括目标定义、数据库检索、深度学习生成结构、化学修饰工具使用与评分，以及逻辑评估等，同时记录工具调用的详细路径信息。

Result: 在针对AKT1蛋白的实验中，多智能体架构在结合位点优化方面表现出色，平均结合亲和力提高31%，而单一智能体方法在药物性能上有所提升但结合能力下降。

Conclusion: 证明一般用途的LLM可以通过多智能体结构和详细记录机制转化为可审计的分子设计系统，并指出扩展工具集（如ADMET预测器）可能进一步提升药物发现效率。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

TL;DR: 该研究将强化学习（RL）成功应用于复杂语言模型（LLMs）的多回合任务中，并改进了其在实际软件工程任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型研究大多集中在单回合任务中，而实际应用如软件工程需要多回合的动态交互环境。

Method: 研究通过修改的分离优势策略优化（DAPO）算法，基于Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct模型训练了一个代理模型来处理现实中的软件工程任务。

Result: 研究发现，其方法在SWE-bench基准测试中将成功率从20%提升到39%，并且在SWE-rebench基准中表现优于其它领先开源模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开源模型构建能够处理复杂实际问题的自主智能体提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

*Seraj Al Mahmud Mostafa,Aravind Mohan,Jianwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SLA-MORL，一个自适应多目标强化学习框架，用于云环境中的资源分配，有效减少训练时间、成本，并提高SLA合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在云计算环境中，同时满足减少训练时间、降低运营成本和遵守SLA约束的需求存在挑战。传统静态或单一目标优化方法效率不足，可能造成SLA违规或资源浪费。

Method: 提出的SLA-MORL框架通过两个关键创新解决问题：1. 利用历史学习或基线运行进行智能初始化，减少初始开销达60%；2. 动态权重调整根据SLA违规严重度实时优化优先级。框架设计包括一个21维状态表示和基于actor-critic的决策网络。

Result: 在13种机器学习工作负载上的测试显示：SLA-MORL对时间敏感任务减少67.2%训练时间，对预算限制任务减少68.8%成本，总体SLA合规性提高73.4%。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL有效解决了冷启动和动态调整问题，在现代ML环境中提供了一种满足性能、成本及可靠性的资源管理实际方案。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的参数高效微调方法（MoKA），通过克罗内克组合和门控机制提高了低秩适配器的表现力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩适配器在参数控制上高效，但由于秩约束在处理复杂任务时往往表现有限，亟需提升其适应性和效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于克罗内克积的混合模型（MoKA），结合门控机制衡量各克罗内克因子的权重，以实现灵活适配；通过标准矩阵操作优化硬件效率。

Result: 在以低位量化版本的LLaMA2-7B和LLaMA3-8B模型进行的指令调优和常识推理任务实验中，MoKA表现超过了现有方法，参数效率提高至27倍。

Conclusion: MoKA实现了性能与参数效率的最佳权衡，展现出成为新一代参数高效微调方法的潜力。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VRPRM（通过视觉推理的过程奖励模型）的新方法，并设计了高效的两阶段训练策略，比传统方法在数据利用效率和推理能力上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRM在长远推理和深层思考能力上存在不足，而引入链式思考（CoT）能力的PRM数据标注成本过高，难以适应广泛任务。

Method: 提出VRPRM模型，并采用两阶段训练策略：使用少量的CoT-PRM微调数据和非CoT PRM强化学习数据来提升推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，仅用3.6K的CoT-PRM数据和50K的非CoT PRM数据，VRPRM即超越使用40万数据的传统模型，在BoN实验中性能提升高达118%。

Conclusion: VRPRM通过高效的数据使用，为PRM训练提供了更优质推理能力的新范式，显著降低了数据标注成本。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: 本论文研究人类标注分歧对机器学习评估的影响，并提出在固定预算下(N x K)优化收集评估数据的配置方式，以提高评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习研究中忽视了人类标注分歧的影响，而探究这一问题因预算限制和评估数据成本的增加受到阻碍。

Method: 分析多种类别数据集，研究在固定预算下(N x K)，如何优化N（项目数量）和K（每个项目的响应数量）的分配，确保评估可靠性，同时模拟不同分布以探索影响各评价指标表现的因素。

Result: 发现在人类分歧考虑的情况下，$N x K$在1000或更小值即可取得良好评估效果，并且大多数情况下$K >10$更具优势。评估指标对分布响应的敏感性也影响了最佳K和N之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 方法有助于机器学习领域找到最佳的评估指标与数据收集配置，以达到在预算内获得最高评估可靠性的目标。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Horus的联邦学习框架，通过低秩适配（LoRA）策略应对高维模型在异构性环境下的中毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在应对不同数据分布、通信能力和模型架构下的异构性时易受中毒攻击，亟需开发更鲁棒的防御框架。

Method: Horus在稳定层中插入LoRAs，仅聚合LoRA以减少攻击面，并利用输入投影LoRA-A的稳定性设计异构性无感知中毒分数过滤中毒客户端，随后通过一致性重加权完成聚合。

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和攻击场景中，Horus在鲁棒性和准确性上均优于最新方法。

Conclusion: Horus通过独特的低秩适配机制显著提升了联邦学习在异构环境中的抗攻击能力，同时保持良好的学习性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的XAI方法缺乏统一优化解释的标准及客观的评价依据。

Method: 通过统一常用忠实性评价指标的公式，设计了一个基于忠实度的目标函数，并结合多种现有解释方法优化解释器。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集的测试中，DeepFaith在忠实性指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: DeepFaith展示了在跨领域中生成高忠实度解释的潜力，为XAI提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Silent Gradients的新方法，它通过特定解码器架构来计算零方差的期望梯度，从而解决了变分自编码器训练中潜变量梯度传播引入的估计方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型在训练时需要处理潜变量的随机采样，会引入梯度估计的方差，导致性能下降和收敛缓慢。该研究旨在提出一种无需提升随机梯度估计器的新方法，以改善生成模型的训练过程。

Method: 通过特定的解码器架构，直接计算无方差的期望ELBO梯度。为了应用到复杂解码器中，引入了一种动态训练方法，在训练前期使用无方差的梯度指导编码器训练，后期逐渐切换为标准随机估计器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集对现有方法（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax、REINFORCE）表现出了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合解析性计算的稳定性与深度非线性架构的表达能力，开启了一种新的训练生成模型的方向。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

TL;DR: 引入了一种新的预训练框架VITA，有效提高了作物产量预测准确性，尤其是在极端天气条件下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型在产量偏离历史趋势时表现不佳，因而需要解决预训练与微调数据不对称的问题。

Method: 提出一种名为VITA的变分推断预训练框架，通过以天气变量为代理目标的自监督特征遮掩技术，使模型能够在有限的基本天气统计数据下进行高效微调。

Result: VITA在美国玉米带的763个县预测了玉米和大豆产量，表现优于现有框架，尤其在极端天气年份取得显著改进（t检验，p≈0.01），且使用更少的数据。

Conclusion: VITA展示了领域感知AI设计如何克服数据局限性，从而支持在气候变化下的农业预测。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SolarSeer，一种用于全美太阳辐照度预测的人工智能模型，能够大幅提高预测精度并显著加快速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数值天气预报模型尽管性能先进，但计算复杂且成本高昂，难以满足快速且精准的太阳辐照度预测需求。

Method: 开发了一个名为SolarSeer的端到端人工智能模型，直接使用历史卫星观测数据进行预测，避免了传统模型中复杂的计算过程。

Result: SolarSeer比传统数值天气预报模型（如HRRR）快1500多倍，预测精度提高了15.35%至27.28%，并在捕捉辐照度波动及一阶变化上表现优异。

Conclusion: SolarSeer以其快速高效的预测能力为实现可持续净零能源系统提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

*Bhavesh Neekhra,Debayan Gupta,Partha Pratim Chakravarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在高维数据集上的特征选择（FS）算法，发现相较于随机选择的特征，FS算法的性能并无明显提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高维数据中FS算法的实际效用，并验证其是否比随机选择特征更有优势。

Method: 通过随机选择特征与FS算法选择特征的分类模型性能进行对比实验。

Result: 训练在随机小子集（0.02%-1%特征）上的模型表现与使用所有特征的模型相当，随机子集的性能甚至优于一些已发表研究中的FS算法。

Conclusion: 作者质疑FS算法在高维数据集尤其是计算基因组学上的有效性，并呼吁在使用计算选择基因设计药物时进行实验室验证。

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

TL;DR: Goedel-Prover-V2是一系列开源语言模型，在自动定理证明领域创造了新的技术标杆，显著超越了现有的开源和封闭源解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动定理证明技术的性能有限，存在效率和可扩展性的问题，开发更强大的工具以提升该领域的能力变得尤为重要。

Method: 1) 通过复杂性递增的合成任务逐步训练模型；2) 向模型引入基于编译器反馈的自我修正机制；3) 通过模型检查点的平均化提升输出多样性。

Result: Goedel-Prover-V2-8B在MiniF2F数据集上的pass@32达84.6%，显著优于DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B；旗舰模型Goedel-Prover-V2-32B在不同模式中也超越其他技术，解决了PutnamBench的86个问题，远超对比模型表现。

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2在开源自动定理证明系统中表现最优，并在有限计算预算内与封闭源模型竞争，推动了领域内模型性能的显著进展。

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高斯混合模型（GMM）样本复杂性的结构性因素，此前的研究集中在最小组件间隔，但这并不完整。

Method: 引入了配对相关因子（PCF），作为组件均值聚类的几何量，并分析其对参数恢复难度的影响；在均匀球面案例中提出具有改进样本复杂性界限的算法。

Result: 展示了样本复杂性与PCF相关联的改进，当需要超过通常的$\epsilon^{-2}$样本时，提供了更好的算法表现。

Conclusion: PCF 是比传统最小间隔更准确衡量GMM学习难度的重要几何量。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

TL;DR: 提出一种个性化微调预训练模型的方法，用于改善跨病人发作起始区(SOZ)诊断表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在处理跨病人问题时表现不稳定的难题，以提高焦点性癫痫患者SOZ诊断的准确性。

Method: 训练一个监督学习模型，通过计算测试患者数据与训练患者数据的相似性，分配加权值，然后用患者权重和相关训练数据对预训练模型进行微调。

Result: 采用留一病人验证法，取得每位测试患者分类精度平均提高超过10%的结果。

Conclusion: 个性化微调方法能够显著提升SOZ诊断的准确性，为解决跨病人问题提供了一种新颖且有效的方案。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Motivation: 探讨深度学习中架构特定选择对内在表示稳定性、对齐性和可转移性的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验探测和转移实验，评估不同架构约束下的内部表示对齐性，开发用于衡量和分析表示对齐的框架。

Result: 结构规则提高了表示在架构变化下的稳定性，且改进了模型间特征的互操作性。

Conclusion: 特定归纳偏差不仅支持模型内的泛化，也有助于增强模型间的表示转移能力，对模型蒸馏、模块化学习等有重要意义。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人等实际应用中，端到端微调需要大量数据，成本高昂，因此希望通过改进方法减少训练和微调所需的样本数量。

Method: 采用形态感知预训练与三种参数高效微调技术（调整权重子集、插入可学习适配器和前缀微调）相结合的方法进行策略训练对比。

Result: 实验表明，将参数高效微调技术应用于预训练策略能够显著减少必要样本数量，同时调节不到1%的总参数即可超过零样本基准性能。

Conclusion: 结合形态感知预训练和参数高效微调技术有助于在不显著增加参数数量的前提下降低训练成本，提升策略性能。

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Method: 采用设计契约（DbC）结合类型理论，在每次调用LLM时引入一个契约层，通过语义和类型检查，确保输入输出符合指定条件。

Result: 通过契约层，LLM的生成过程具备了语义和类型上的合规约束，增强了模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于契约的验证方法证明了其在增强LLM生成内容可信度的潜力，同时提出满足相同契约的任何两个代理即是功能等价的观点。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

Result: 通过基准测试和实时控制实验验证了SkyGP在性能和效率上的优势。

Conclusion: SkyGP框架在保持GP学习性能的同时，显著降低了计算和存储复杂度，适于实时动态系统的应用。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 自我生成问题并解答的框架能够有效改进语言模型的能力，适用于无需额外人工数据集的场景。

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

Conclusion: PAC-EIG方法首次为主动逆强化学习提供了理论可靠性保证，并在实验中展示了其性能优越性。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Conclusion: 将神经科学原理整合到网络设计中可显著提升模型的效率和鲁棒性，并为解决机器学习中的长期挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在音频驱动下交谈人头生成过程中推理速度缓慢的问题。

Method: 通过时间VAE学习视频潜在空间并结合Speech Autoencoder生成音频潜在编码，同时设计Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer进行高效生成，并引入异步噪声调度器（ANS）提升时序一致性和推理速度。

Result: READ的实验结果表明其生成视频质量与速度优于现有方法，同时在长时间生成任务中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: READ在生成质量和速度之间实现了平衡，为音频驱动的交谈人头生成提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.
