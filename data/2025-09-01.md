Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过深度学习实现全景牙科X光片的自动分类，提出混合模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能自动分类牙科状态的系统，提升诊断效率和精度。

Method: 构建自定义CNN、混合模型与预训练模型，使用5折交叉验证，评估多项模型性能。

Result: 混合CNN-随机森林模型表现最佳，取得85.4%的准确率，高于自定义CNN（74.3%）。

Conclusion: 混合模型增强对相似形态条件的区分能力，结合CNN特征提取与分类器为实现自动牙科诊断提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Q-Align方法解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，提高语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中的语义对齐挑战，即注意力泄漏问题。

Method: 提出Q-Align，包括：(1) Query-Query对齐；(2) Key-Value重新排列；(3) 使用重新排列的键和值进行注意力优化。

Result: 通过实验验证，Q-Align在外观真实性上优于现有方法，并保持较好的结构保留能力。

Conclusion: Q-Align能够有效缓解注意力泄漏问题，提升零样本外观迁移中的语义对齐和外观真实性。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ERTACache框架，通过分析特征缓存中的错误来源，并从缓存步骤、动态调整积分间隔等方面进行改进，实现扩散模型推理阶段的显著加速，同时保证生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散模型的迭代推理特性，其计算开销大大增加。使用特征缓存虽然可以加速推理，但存在明显的质量退化问题，因此需要优化缓存策略。

Method: 通过形式化分析缓存误差，将其分解为特征偏移误差和步放大误差两部分；提出ERTACache框架，包括离线残差分析、动态调整积分间隔以及基于封闭形式的残差线性近似模型，从而提升缓存重用的准确性和效率。

Result: 在对标准图像和视频生成基准的实验中，ERTACache实现了高达2倍的推理加速，同时保持甚至改善了生成质量。在最新的Wan2.1视频扩散模型中，ERTACache以最小的指标退化实现2倍加速，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: ERTACache显著提升了扩散模型推理效率，同时保证了生成质量的稳定性，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种名为TVS（Temporal Visual Screening）的方法，通过选取关键视频片段、调整查询并保持答案一致性，从而提升视频问答和指令调优过程中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频大语言模型在捕捉细粒度的时间语义上表现不佳，原因在于稀疏的帧采样和缺乏帧间推理监督。作者希望帮助模型更好地处理视频内的时间信息并优化推理效果。

Method: 提出了一种名为TVS的任务作为预处理手段，通过（1）保留关键视频片段、（2）对查询进行同步重构使其更直接并保持答案一致性，以及（3）保持答案的恒定性和一致性。此外，该方法设计为一个模块化的前端适配器，可无缝集成到训练（Video Instruction Tuning）和推理（Video Question Answering）流程中。

Result: 实验表明，使用TVS在训练中取得了7.33%的相对增益，在推理中实现了34.6%的相对增益。其基准测试方法ReSimplifyIt在视频剪辑任务上超越了先前方法，F-1得分提高了0.47，同时在查询重写性能上也具备竞争力。

Conclusion: TVS方法通过优化推理负担分配和调整认知负载，显著提升了视频语言理解，证明了时间信息筛选的有效性及其重要性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的骨架姿态标注方法，用于外科手术工具定位，并开发了一个综合数据集和基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量多样化的标注数据，而提出的骨架姿态标注兼顾语义信息丰富性和易标注性。

Method: 利用现有ROBUST-MIS数据集，创建了一个结合工具姿态和工具实例分割的ROBUST-MIPS数据集，并设立基准测试。

Result: 在基准中，基于姿态估计方法的测试展示了高质量的定位效果。

Conclusion: 姿态标注是一种高效的数据标注方法，适合外科工具定位，相关数据集和工具有助于推动其采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Safe-Control的插件式安全机制，通过注入安全控制信号降低文本生成图像模型(T2I模型)中的不安全内容生成概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I生成模型取得了显著进展，但其潜在的滥用风险引发了严重的安全问题，现有机制在应对分布偏移或适配特定模型时存在局限。

Method: 引入Safe-Control，一种基于数据和安全感知条件的插件式安全更新，通过注入安全信号减少不安全内容生成，支持不同安全补丁的灵活组合。

Result: 在六个T2I模型上评估发现，Safe-Control显著降低了不安全内容生成概率，同时保持高质量和文本对齐。相比七种现有机制，Safe-Control在不安全提示和对抗攻击下表现更优，生成不安全内容的概率从约20%降至7%。

Conclusion: Safe-Control提供了一种高效且适应性强的T2I模型安全解决方案，能够应对多种安全需求并大幅提升内容安全性。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GENNAV模型，用于根据自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像识别目标区域的位置，并在GRiN-Drive基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法不能有效处理边界模糊的stuff型目标区域以及多目标场景，亟需提出能够应对这些挑战的方法。

Method: 提出GENNAV模型，该方法通过预测目标存在性，并为stuff型目标区域生成分割掩膜。为评估其性能，还构建了GRiN-Drive数据集，包含无目标、单目标与多目标三种场景。

Result: GENNAV在基准测试中优于现有方法，并在四辆汽车通过五个城市地区的真实环境测试中展示了其零样本迁移能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV有效解决了stuff型目标区域定位问题，并在标准数据集和真实世界场景中表现优异，具有良好的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B 是一种拥有自适应思考能力的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），可在面临复杂问题时进行深度推理，而在简单问题前避免冗余思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时，由于冗余的逐步推理过程，导致效率较低，因此需要设计能够自适应简化推理过程的模型。

Method: 通过“双模态退火”（Bi-mode Annealing）赋予模型思考和不思考的能力，并使用双模态策略优化（BPO）来提升模型判断是否激活推理过程的准确性。训练分两步：第一步在整合了思考与非思考模式的数据集上训练；第二步在改进的GRPO框架下训练策略模型，使其根据输入生成两种模式的响应。

Result: R-4B 在25个挑战性基准上取得了最先进的性能，在大多数任务上优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，同时以更低计算成本实现了与体量更大的模型（如Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506）在推理密集型基准上的相当表现。

Conclusion: R-4B 通过适应性启用或跳过推理过程，平衡了效率与性能，为高效智能推理提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

### [10] [HiddenObject: Modality-Agnostic Fusion for Multimodal Hidden Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21135)
*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiddenObject框架，利用融合RGB、热成像和深度数据的方法，改进在视线障碍和复杂视觉环境下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RGB的方法在被遮挡、伪装和光照变化等复杂环境中表现较差，需要一种更稳健的、与模态无关的检测方法。

Method: 设计了一个基于Mamba的融合框架“HiddenObject”，融合了RGB、热成像和深度数据，通过提取独特的模态特征并转化为统一的表示形式实现目标检测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了方法性能，表现出优于或与当前方法相当的结果，并揭示了现有单模态和简单融合方法的局限性。

Conclusion: Mamba融合架构可以显著推动多模态目标检测领域的发展，特别是在视线受干扰或复杂条件下。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg 是一种新型框架，结合了 3D Radiative Gaussians（RadGS）重建和 3D/3D 配准，用于椎骨级别的 CT/X-ray 配准，解决了传统方法的空间信息丢失和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统 CT/X-ray 注册方法中由于空间信息丢失和噪声影响而导致的准确性和实时性问题，以及现有 3D 重建方法对于高密度视角需求的局限性。

Method: 提出 RadGS-Reg 框架，通过学习驱动的 RadGS 重建和对噪声 X-ray 采用反事实注意力学习（CAL）机制，专注于椎骨区域。同时引入病人特异性预训练策略，从模拟数据到真实数据渐进适应，并学习椎骨形状先验知识。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验证明了 RadGS-Reg 在椎骨级别的 CT/X-ray 注册任务中的最先进性能，超越了现有的方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg 提供了一种高效且准确的 CT/X-ray 注册解决方案，尤其在处理噪声图像时效果显著，推动了图像引导导航技术的发展。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 数据集及代码已公开发布，可为建筑建模等领域的研究提供基础支持，推动相关技术发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at
https://github.com/kdmayer/SYNBUILD-3D.

*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种创新的方法，同时解决了径向畸变下三种不同配置下的单应性估计问题，并提供了更快、更稳定且准确的解算器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在几何计算机视觉任务中，单应性估计是一个重要步骤，而真实图像中常伴有镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变），需要同时估计单应性和径向畸变。

Method: 提出了一个统一的方法来同时解决三种径向畸变配置（仅一幅图像具有畸变，两幅图像具有相同畸变，两幅图像具有独立畸变）。

Result: 所提出的解算器在三种配置下比现有最先进的解算器更快，同时保持相似的精度，并在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的知名基准测试中进行了验证。

Conclusion: 新方法为径向畸变单应性问题提供了速度更快、稳定性更高、精度更优的解决方案，且为进一步研究提供了代码支持。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Motivation: 现有的CAV在不同层计算时常表现出不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一个统一且语义一致的表示来解决这个问题。

Method: 利用对比学习对概念表示进行跨层对齐，并通过基于注意力的融合机制构建出一个全局一体化的CAV，称为GCAV。同时，提出TGCAV方法，将TCAV应用于GCAV表示进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，GCAV有效地减少了TCAV得分的方差，提升了概念定位能力并增强了对抗扰动下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过将跨层信息整合到一致框架中，GCAV提供了一种更全面且可解释的方式来理解深度学习模型对人类定义概念的编码方式。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入了一种名为Visual In-Context Prompting (VICP)的新框架，通过视觉提示和语义规则实现跨类别的广义目标重识别(ReID)，无需对模型参数进行适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前目标ReID方法依赖领域特异性模型，但缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。现有的无监督学习方法虽能减少标注需求，但无法有效捕捉ReID关键的身份敏感特征。

Method: 提出了VICP框架，结合了大语言模型(LLM)和视觉基础模型(VFM)。LLM通过少样本正负对推导语义身份规则，指导VFM使用动态视觉提示提取身份区分特征，从而在看不到类别上实现泛化。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准上，VICP相较于基线在看不到类别上表现出了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: VICP克服了现有方法的泛化和数据需求限制，通过结合LLM和VFM成功在新类别上实现高效的ReID，同时无需数据集特定的再训练。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于 MRI 的胰腺肿瘤分割，采用 SegResNet 模型，通过 Auto3DSeg 架构的算法对两项任务进行训练和评估。虽然性能存在局限，结果表明自动分割的潜力以及对更大标准化数据集的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于解剖变异性和数据集限制导致的胰腺肿瘤自动分割难题，提升诊断和治疗的准确性。

Method: 利用 SegResNet 模型及 Auto3DSeg 架构，进行 5 折交叉验证并结合 STAPLE 集成，重点分割解剖相关的感兴趣区域，并评估其在 MRI 数据上的分割性能。

Result: 任务 1 的分割性能较好，DSC 达到 0.56，但任务 2 的性能较低，DSC 仅为 0.33，整体结果表明不同 MRI 序列带来的变量性和数据集规模的限制。

Conclusion: 小型 MRI 数据集的限制和序列变异性对胰腺肿瘤分割性能有显著影响。尽管结果一般，但证明自动分割技术有前景，需更大、更标准化的数据集提高模型可靠性及实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Result: 实验表明，“逆成像”方法在跨各种图像对比度和不同成像协议下，实现了高精度的心脏MRI分割。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理驱动的数据增强和域自适应解决了心脏MRI图像分割的泛化问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

*Hsuan-I Ho,Chen Guo,Po-Chen Wu,Ivan Shugurov,Chengcheng Tang,Abhay Mittal,Sizhe An,Manuel Kaufmann,Linguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PHD，一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复和身体拟合方法，通过利用用户特定的身体形态信息提升视频中的姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMR的传统方法是用户无关的，优化目标是通用性，忽略了个体形状信息对3D姿态精度的贡献。

Method: 提出一个新的方法，通过先校准用户的身体形状，然后使用个性化的基于形状的姿态拟合流程。此外，开发了一个基于形状的3D姿态先验（Point Diffusion Transformer），结合点蒸馏采样损失进行优化。

Result: 该方法显著减少了对2D约束的过度依赖带来的误差，并提升了骨盆对齐的姿态精度和绝对姿态精度，同时具备较高的数据效率，仅需合成数据进行训练。

Conclusion: PHD方法不仅提高了姿态估计精度，还可作为现有3D姿态估计器的插入模块，扩展其性能。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计方法，通过层次化时间剪枝策略显著减少计算成本，并保持运动动态的关键信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型尽管能够生成高质量的3D人体姿态，但其迭代性质和多假设需求导致计算成本高昂。

Method: 该方法引入了分层时间剪枝（HTP）策略，包括：(1)通过自适应时间图构建分析帧间运动相关性的时间增强剪枝（TCEP）；(2)利用帧级稀疏分析减少注意力计算的稀疏聚焦时间多头自注意力（SFT MHSA）；(3)通过聚类保留关键姿态标记的掩码引导姿态标记剪枝（MGPTP）。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有扩散模型相比，HTP在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，训练和推理的计算量分别减少了38.5%和56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: 提出的HTP策略有效平衡了计算效率和精度，展示了基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为Print2Volume的框架，从2D指纹图像生成逼真的OCT 3D合成指纹，并显著提高识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于OCT数据采集成本高且时间耗费，缺乏大型公开数据集，阻碍了高级算法，特别是深度学习模型的开发。

Method: 框架分为三个阶段：(1) 使用2D样式迁移模块将二值指纹转换为Z方向OCT扫描样式灰度图；(2) 利用3D结构扩展网络将2D图像扩展为3D体积；(3) 基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器渲染体积，加入纹理和噪声特性。

Result: 生成了42万样本的大规模合成数据集，实验表明其高质量性能显著提升了识别效果，EER从15.62%降至2.50%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，利用合成数据预训练与小规模真实数据微调显著提高了指纹识别的性能。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 解决手术录像分析费时费力的问题，同时克服医学领域数据稀缺的障碍。

Method: 开发了一个名为GLENDA的图像数据集，包含子宫内膜异位症的区域标注，并与医学专家合作创建。

Result: 提供了首个专注于子宫内膜异位症图像标注的数据集，为计算机视觉和机器学习研究提供重要资源。

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集是推进妇科内镜检查自动化分析的重要工具，有助于医学计划、教学和文档记录。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Method: 采用区域卷积网络，对外科器械进行分割和识别，分别探讨二分类分割（工具或背景）和多分类识别（工具类型）。

Result: 在数据集较小的情况下，能够以较高精度完成工具的定位和分割，但工具类型的识别依然困难。

Conclusion: 尽管可实现工具区域的高效分割，但由于工具内在的高相似性，进一步的识别面临挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Motivation: 当前WSI的元数据标准缺失，使得训练和验证AI算法需人工检查，不适用于大规模数据集。

Method: 研究提出一个通用框架，通过生成三层组织图(来源层、组织类型层、病理变化层)和通用语法语义，实现WSI内容的精细化分析与跨目录互操作性。

Conclusion: 新框架为WSI的标注与AI训练提供可靠支持，展示了在临床病理和机器学习应用中的显著优势。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的增量学习方法通常假设增量数据集是完全标注的，但这一假设在现实中并不现实，因此需开发无监督的增量学习方法。

Method: 提出一种基于置信度的伪标签生成方法（ICPL），通过选择高置信度伪标签替代人工标注，并将其与多种增量学习方法集成。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上进行评估，ICPL相比现有的无监督方法性能提升超5%，并在细粒度数据集上验证其实用性和适用于资源受限环境的能力。

Conclusion: ICPL方法在无监督增量数据场景中表现优异，实现与监督方法相当的性能，并超越现有的最新无监督方法，在实际应用中具有高度潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Motivation: 合成医学数据有助于模型训练，但其与真实数据存在显著域差异，限制了其实际应用。本研究旨在解决这种合成与真实X光头部图像之间的跨域翻译问题。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges设计，采用无配对图像翻译的方式，学习共享的无域依赖潜在空间，并创建了新的X-DigiSkull数据集进行模型评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift在保持较小模型规模的同时表现优异，并且推理时可灵活在感知质量与结构一致性之间调整优先级。

Conclusion: MedShift是一种可扩展且通用的医学影像域适应解决方案，能够填补合成与真实数据之间的差距，为医疗应用提供重要的技术支撑。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 为了解决多模态大型语言模型(MLLMs)在设备端运行的计算需求问题，作者开发了一个基于125M参数语言模型的轻量级图像描述模型，并提出新的“Sharp-Eyed Refinement”框架来提升视觉基础和描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用现有大型多模态语言模型进行图像描述的高计算需求，使得其在本地设备上的部署困难，激发了开发轻量级、高效模型的需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于较小参数量模型（125M参数）实现图像描述的办法，并通过“Sharp-Eyed Refinement”框架引入了改进的视觉关注机制和区域重点提取策略。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在单句和详细描述任务中表现优异，性能接近大型多模态模型；新框架显著改善了视觉盲点问题，并提高了描述质量。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了小参数模型在图像描述任务中的潜力，并提出了能有效提升描述质量的创新框架，这为实现设备上的多模态应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MME的分数机制，将多种现有最优分数技术结合，用于优化OOD样本检测，显著提高了开放世界情景下神经网络的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测方法多关注单一技术或特定类型的OOD数据，忽略了多技术组合所可能带来的优势，因此试图探讨并结合多种现有算法以改进性能。

Method: 理论上和实验上验证并结合现有的特征截断和评分方法，同时通过多种评分函数的聚合提升了对各种OOD样本的鲁棒性。最终提出MME分数机制，将多种现有OOD检测方法整合为一个统一的、更有效的评分函数。

Result: 在大规模和小规模基准测试，包括近OOD和远OOD场景中，实验结果表明MME方法在所有基准上显著优于最新技术方法。在ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用BiT模型时平均FPR95为27.57%，比现有最佳基线提高了6%。

Conclusion: 结合多种最优特征和评分方法的MME技术显著增强了神经网络面向OOD样本的检测准确性，特别是在高挑战性的基准测试中展示了其卓越性能。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 局部增强方法在避免背景干扰的同时，能够有效地提升对抗性攻击效果及其迁移能力，在遥感图像目标检测中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 基础模型的特征图对下游任务有用，但因分辨率限制，无法细致表征微观图像特征和应对大面积图像处理的需求。

Method: 设计卷积神经网络，将基础模型的低分辨率特征进行上采样，以原始图像作为参考。

Result: 该方法高效描述并分割包括植物细胞、电池阴极有机晶体在内的显微图像，可解析难以分割的微观特征如发际裂纹。

Conclusion: 无需进一步训练，仅利用这些深度特征进行交互式分割，可显著提升分割质量并减少标注数量与时间。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Motivation: 主流的视觉-语言模型在无人机场景中由于视角广阔与复杂的组合语义而表现受限，且现有方法依赖于精确分割和刚性约束，难以应对动态环境。

Method: 提出了HCCM框架，该框架包括两个组件：区域-全局图文对比学习（RG-ITC）和区域-全局图文匹配（RG-ITM），并引入了动量对比与蒸馏机制（MCD）以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，HCCM在GeoText-1652数据集上的Recall@1达到了图像检索的28.8%和文本检索的14.7%，在ERA数据集上也展现了出色的零样本泛化能力，mR值达到39.93%。

Conclusion: HCCM框架成功应对了无人机场景中复杂语义和广阔视角带来的挑战，以优越的性能表现提升了相关任务的效果。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Motivation: 传统方法对被遮挡和未观测区域的3D重建存在模糊和不逼真等缺陷，亟需生成更完整场景的方法。

Method: 提出一个生成式框架，通过变分自编码器和扩散模型训练，从2D图像中自监督学习，生成高斯点阵的3D场景表示。

Result: 新方法能够生成逼真、高质量的完整3D场景重建，特别是在遮挡区域的推断具有多样性。

Conclusion: 新方法在3D场景重建中效果显著，为单一图像条件下生成完整3D视图提供了一种有效途径。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP的先验知识和不确定性意识的采样方法，可提供高效、可扩展的配对排序解决方案，显著优化标注效率。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,

fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct

street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

### [41] [Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580)
*Nico Albert Disch,Yannick Kirchhoff,Robin Peretzke,Maximilian Rokuss,Saikat Roy,Constantin Ulrich,David Zimmerer,Klaus Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)的新方法，用于处理医学影像中的时间动态问题，该方法支持3D体积、多次扫描和不规则采样，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法对医学图像的时间动态问题处理有限，缺乏对多时间点、多疾病和精细空间预测的支持。

Method: 引入Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)作为一种统一的生成轨迹方法，旨在学习底层时间分布，同时支持W3D体积和多个时间点扫描，并能够在特殊情况下回退到最近图像预测。

Result: 实验表明，TFM在三个公开纵向数据集上的表现超越了现有的时空方法，成为新的最佳基线。

Conclusion: TFM为4D医学图像预测建立了一个稳健的基线，为时间动态分析提供了卓越的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的多模态方法，通过整合术前CT和术后全切片组织图像(WSIs)，预测肾透明细胞癌(ccRCC)的复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Leibovich评分在病人分层和整合影像信息方面存在局限，亟需更精确的病人个体化风险预测方法。

Method: 采用预训练编码器和基于Cox模型的生存分析框架，测试单模态、晚期融合和中期融合模型的性能，并进行实验对比分析。

Result: 发现基于WSI的单模态模型优于单纯CT模型；通过简单的特征拼接，中期融合模型性能更优，且部分中期融合模型性能接近Leibovich评分标准。

Conclusion: 研究验证了深度学习基础模型整合多模态数据预测ccRCC复发风险的可行性，未来研究应重点探索更大规模数据集、更广泛的融合策略，以及适用于CT的模型改进。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的CGH方法存在非线性和病态问题，并且深度学习算法中普遍存在黑箱模型、局部感受野限制和有限近场的缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度展开网络的模型，包含自适应带宽保留模型(ABPM)和相位域复数值去噪器(PCD)。ABPM克服了ASM基方法的有限近场限制，而PCD通过复数值自适应注意力模块捕获全局特征。

Result: 所提方法在PSNR指标上超过35 dB，在模拟和真实数据上均取得了目前最优的结果。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了CGH中非线性和局部依赖性问题，具有更好的灵活性和全局性能，适合更广范围的应用场景。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 由于示踪剂的异质性、生理性摄取及多中心数据的差异，全身PET/CT病灶分割存在挑战性，临床需要能够结合人工交互的高效分割方法。

Method: 基于nnU-Net模型，加入用户点击提示作为额外输入通道，采用欧几里得距离变换(EDT)进行空间提示表示，并通过自定义点采样策略和在线用户交互模拟提升模型稳健性。

Result: 模型在交叉验证中表现出更低的假阳性和假阴性率，相较基线模型有明显提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型展示了交互式分割方法在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中的高效性和潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种新的概率投影机制，通过几何转化和自适应机制改进摄像头图像到HD地图生成的投影精度，提高了对长距离感知的表现并改进了时间信息处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HD地图生成方法在从图像空间到俯视图（BEV）空间的映射中精度有限，易产生虚假的道路元素，研究动机是改进这种在投影精度方面的不足。

Method: 该方法使用基于几何的投影技术，结合摄像机参数和新的概率投影机制，并引入信心评分来过滤和选择有效信息。同时，通过信心评分改进了时间维度的处理。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上验证了其优越性，特别是在nuScenes和长距离感知任务上表现出明显的性能改进。

Conclusion: 方法在数据集上实现了对最新技术的性能超越，验证了其改进摄像头图像到BEV地图生成精度和泛化能力的有效性。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前扩散模型在目标检测领域生成合成数据所需计算资源与数据量过高的问题。

Method: 利用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，采用Low-Rank Adaptation（LoRA）技术进行微调，在低计算资源的情况下生成高质量的合成数据。

Result: 在七个多样的目标检测数据集上实验表明，使用仅500张合成图像训练的目标检测模型，相较于ODGEN基线的5000张合成图像，mAP@.50:.95性能提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA通过提高数据生成质量与生成效率，使合成数据制作更加实用且易于实际应用，仅需较少计算资源即可实现超越现有性能的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了利用CNN激活中的熵特征来检测对抗性扰动的无损检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对抗性扰动检测方法需要高昂代价或对网络架构改动的问题。

Method: 通过监测VGG-16早期卷积层的激活熵变化检测对抗性输入，无需修改模型或降低正常输入性能。

Result: 对抗性输入引起的激活熵变化约为7%，实现了90%的检测准确率，误报率和漏报率均低于20%。

Conclusion: CNN激活模式中固有的熵分布变化可用于实时检测对抗性输入，保障模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CAD2DMD-SET，一种用于生成DMD合成数据集的工具，以改进LVLMs在复杂条件下的表现。此外，还引入了DMDBench作为现实世界场景中的验证集，并在性能测试中获得显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在读取DMD信息时表现不佳，尤其是在遮挡、复杂视角和运动模糊等现实场景中。为解决此问题，作者提出了一个工具来生成高质量的标注数据集。

Method: 通过3D CAD模型、高级渲染和图像合成，生成多样化的DMD合成数据集（CAD2DMD-SET），并验证其在DMDBench上的效果。此外，改进了LVLMs的训练过程。

Result: 在实验中，经过CAD2DMD-SET微调的LVLM性能显著提高，例如InternVL的ANLS分数提升了200%，且对其他任务的表现无影响。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET显著提升了LVLM在复杂DMD任务中的鲁棒性和性能，工具将开源以供社区扩展及应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Motivation: 当前方法在面对诸如静音、噪音、离屏声音等负音频场景表现较差，评估方法也主要集中于单一音源场景，无法全面衡量模型能力。

Method: 提出了一种新训练策略，融入静音和噪音情况，增强了模型在正负音频场景下的鲁棒性；设计了一个新的评价指标，衡量音视特征在对齐性与可分性之间的权衡；改进了IS3数据集，加入负音频场景（IS3+）。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了模型在混合音频场景下的鲁棒性，新的度量指标和改进的数据集有效推动了领域的发展，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基于大规模网页预训练的基础模型（如CLIP）在域泛化任务中的表现存在难点，因为预训练数据可能涵盖了大多数现有基准数据集，使得现有评估方法难以测试真正未见数据场景。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法，通过对CLIP的编码器加入独立领域识别模块及使用合成多样化领域数据，增强领域意识，同时通过与领域特征的解耦来提升领域不变分类性能。

Result: CLIP-DCA在具有挑战性的评估任务中表现显著优于现有方法，特别是在更偏离分布（OOD）的数据集上。

Conclusion: CLIP的性能在面对挑战性未见数据时有所下降，但通过增强领域感知和优化领域不变分类性能的CLIP-DCA方法，可以大幅改善其表现。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要在封闭集上的典型数据中进行，而对开放世界中的非典型视频数据的潜力探讨不足。本文旨在研究将在学习过程中引入非典型视频数据对开放世界学习的帮助。

Method: 收集了包含多种非典型数据的视频数据集，并在模型训练中引入这些数据用于表示学习，着重研究在OOD检测、NCD和ZSAR任务上的表现。

Result: 结果表明，非典型数据可以显著提高上述任务的性能；更高的语义多样性进一步提升OOD检测性能，而更小但语义多样性的非典型数据集对NCD更有利；在ZSAR任务中，非典型数据的语义多样性帮助模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频数据在开放世界视觉表示学习中具有显著益处，新数据集的提出为该研究方向提供了支持，鼓励其他研究进一步探索。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 本研究聚焦胰腺导管癌（PDAC）的自动分割，基于nnU-Net框架开发，通过多阶段迁移学习策略与专家模型集成，实现了较高的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服胰腺癌MRI分割中肿瘤组织对比度差及标注数据稀缺的问题，提高诊断与治疗的准确性。

Method: 利用多阶段迁移学习和nnU-Net框架，结合5折交叉验证策略优化数据增强方法和训练计划，最终设计多模型集合提升分割性能。

Result: 任务1最高肿瘤Dice分数为0.661，任务2为0.523，边界精度MASD为5.46mm，HD95为17.33mm，展现了顶尖的分割效果。

Conclusion: 本文方法在有限数据及复杂医学影像任务中展现了强大的建模能力，为PDAC分割问题提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5显著提升了辐射肿瘤学领域的表现，在多项测试中表现出色，但仍需专业审查以确保临床实施的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-5在肿瘤学中的潜力，尤其是在辐射肿瘤学诊断支持和治疗方面的能力。

Method: 使用两个基准测试评估GPT-5：一个是2021年ACR辐射肿瘤学内部考试（TXIT），另一个是60个辐射肿瘤学案例的治疗方案生成任务。四位放射肿瘤学认证专家对结果进行评估。

Result: 在TXIT评估中，GPT-5准确率达92.8%，明显优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5；在案例生成上，其治疗建议在正确性（3.24/4）和全面性（3.59/4）方面表现理想，产生幻觉情况较少。

Conclusion: GPT-5在辐射肿瘤学中的表现显著优于前代模型，但复杂场景中的错误仍需克服，其生成的建议仍需专业人员严格监督以实现临床应用。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用三种存储库进行统一结构与逻辑异常检测的框架TMUAD，有效提升异常检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法多依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器与存储库来捕捉对象之间的逻辑关系，但仍在逻辑异常检测方面存在不足。

Method: 设计了一个三重存储框架，包括基于逻辑的文本存储库、基于物体轮廓的图像存储库以及用于结构异常检测的图像特征存储库，融合多层次的异常评分实现统一检测。

Result: 在七个工业与医疗领域公开数据集上实现了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过协作存储库融合逻辑与结构异常检测，有效提高了模型的检测精度与实用性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现对视频中目标的精细定位及语义描述，同时通过三种模态提示探索视频理解的更多可能性。

Method: 提出VoCap模型，通过对现有大规模分割数据集(SAV)注释伪对象描述，并结合其他数据集训练，进行多任务学习。

Result: 在指称表达视频目标分割任务中达到最先进效果，在半监督视频目标分割具备竞争力，并建立了视频目标描述基准。

Conclusion: VoCap在视频理解中实现了多模态提示的视频目标分割和描述，为未来视频理解研究提供了新方向及高质量数据集。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Motivation: 现有动词分类方法将其作为单标签问题处理，但存在不可避免的语义模糊性问题，即同一图像可能对应多个合理的动词类别。

Method: 研究将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习问题（SPMLL），并设计了名为GE-VerbMLP的模型，通过图神经网络捕获标签间关联，结合对抗训练优化决策边界，同时构建多标签评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据集上实现了超过3%的MAP提升，同时在传统Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究证明将动词分类视为多标签问题的合理性，提出的模型与评估框架能够显著提升语义角色识别任务的表现，为该领域开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否能通过驾驶知识测试，检验其对交通规则、标志和复杂驾驶场景的理解能力。

Method: 设计并提出一个名为DriveQA的基准，包含文本和视觉任务，覆盖全面的驾驶场景和交通规则。通过实验测试模型的性能，并在DriveQA基础上进行微调和训练，以提升其驾驶任务表现。

Result: 当前模型在基础交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景和环境敏感性上有明显不足。DriveQA微调和预训练提升了模型的表现，模型也展现了从文本和合成交通知识中进行有效泛化的能力。

Conclusion: DriveQA可以提升语言模型在复杂驾驶任务中的表现，并为研究大语言模型在驾驶场景下的应用提供了良好的工具。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为CoBA的统一框架，通过分解文本的语义层级并对其关键部分进行修改，生成能减弱偏差的数据，从而提高模型应对非平稳数据的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度学习模型在训练数据中常会学习非目标相关特性（例如性别偏差），这些特性会影响预测并致使在未知数据上的泛化能力下降，因此研究旨在解决此问题。

Method: 作者提出了一种称为CounterBias Augmentation（CoBA）的框架。该框架通过对文本分解为语义三元组（主体-谓语-客体）并选择性修改其中的三元组，以破坏偏差性关联并重建文本生成数据。

Result: 实验证明，CoBA框架不仅改善了任务性能，还有效减少了偏差并增强了对非分布数据的适应能力。

Conclusion: CoBA作为一种统一方法，提出了应对深度学习模型中因偏差关联引发的泛化问题的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景信息，限制了我们对不同年龄群体在线交流方式的理解。

Method: 收集了来自Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的匿名评论，通过毒性关键词筛选和人工与先进语言模型注释，构建了一个包含3024条人工注释和30024条机器注释的德语数据集。

Result: 发现了年龄相关的毒性言论模式差异：年轻人偏好表达性语言，而年长者更倾向于传播虚假信息和贬低性语言。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究人口统计学语言差异提供了新资源，并支持创建更公平、年龄感知的内容审核系统。

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Motivation: 探讨认知偏差如何影响LLMs的可靠性及其在真实世界中的应用，尤其是在价格谈判中的锚定效应。

Method: 让卖方LLM代理施加锚定效应，并通过客观和主观指标对谈判结果进行评估；还研究了锚定效应与推理和个性等因素的关系。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs像人类一样受锚定效应影响；推理模型对锚定效应的敏感性更低，但个性特征与该效应并无显著相关性。

Conclusion: 深入理解LLMs的认知偏差特性，有助于实现其在社会中的安全与负责任的应用。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

Motivation: 探讨多模态大语言模型在基础感知任务上的能力，弥补现有研究的不足。

Method: 设计并引入了Percept-V数据集，其中包含7200张程序生成的图像，测试30种感知技能，并使用一系列先进的模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等）进行评估。

Result: 与以往认知MLLMs擅长复杂任务的结论相反，实验显示模型在复杂任务中的表现显著下降，不同技能测试的准确率呈现类似趋势，有些技能更具挑战性。

Conclusion: MLLMs在处理基础感知任务时表现不如复杂任务，数据揭示了特定感知技能的挑战性，表明需要进一步提升模型的基础认知能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨大语言模型在自我与跨模型评价中的偏见及其对评价结果的影响，发现标签偏见显著影响了模型的评分，提出了使用盲评或多模型评估协议的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决当前大语言模型在输出评价中的潜在偏见问题，研究考察了模型身份对评分的影响机制及其深远影响。

Method: 通过分析ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude模型在无标签、真实标签与两种错误标签条件下评估彼此生成的博客文章的结果，从偏好投票和质量评分角度进行比较。

Result: 发现偏见显著的评估不对称现象，如标签‘Claude’会提升评分，而‘Gemini’标签则使评分降低，不同标签条件下偏好和评分变化幅度高达50个百分点和12个百分点。

Conclusion: 模型身份对高层次判断和质量评分产生了显著影响，建议采用盲评或多模型评估协议以确保语言模型基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于序列贝叶斯实验设计的方法（称为BED-LLM），旨在增强大语言模型（LLMs）获取信息的能力，从而提高其交互性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多轮对话和与外界环境交互中表现有限，需要更高效的方法帮助其主动获取关键信息。

Method: 利用贝叶斯实验设计原则，在多轮交互中基于信息增益最大化，迭代选择问题进行信息获取，同时采用定制的信息增益估计器和候选查询生成策略增强模型能力。

Result: 在基于20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断的广泛测试中，BED-LLM相较于直接提示和其他设计策略表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: BED-LLM方法有效增强了大语言模型的交互智能能力，为信息获取和用户交互提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于强化学习的自动化HFACS分类框架，提高航空安全分析的效率与准确性，优化了Llama-3.1 8B模型，性能超越现有LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS方法因拓展性和一致性受限，难以满足现代航空安全分析需求。

Method: 通过使用强化学习中的GRPO方法对Llama-3.1 8B语言模型进行微调，并结合多组件奖励系统与合成数据生成以平衡数据集中的类别不平衡。

Result: 改进后的模型在精确匹配准确率上提升了350%（从0.0400到0.1800），部分匹配准确率达到0.8800，显著超越现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 优化的小型专业领域模型在航空安全分析中能够实现高效及低延迟部署，为资源受限的边缘设备运行提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的自回归语言模型容易受到正字法攻击，即通过改变输入文本字符使其显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是解决子词分词器及其嵌入方法在处理多语言输入中固有的 out-of-vocabulary 问题，提升对多语言文本的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种基于像素的生成语言模型，用像素表示替代文本嵌入，将单词渲染为独立图像进行处理。

Result: 实验在多个数据集（LAMBADA、WMT24 和 SST-2）上验证方法的鲁棒性和其在多语言场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过像素表示方式，可有效解决正字法噪音问题，同时在多语言环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了自监督语音模型中是否存在类似于人类语言习得过程中关键期效应的现象，发现自监督语音模型未表现出明显的关键期效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否自监督语音模型表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，扩展对语音语言模型的理解。

Method: 通过控制第二语言暴露时间和第一语言暴露终止时间，训练自监督语音模型，并评估其音素辨别能力。

Result: 未观察到明确的关键期效应，延迟接触第二语言的模型反而表现更好，延迟接触结束第一语言导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在语音习得方面并未表现出明确的关键期相关特性，这与人类语言习得略有不同。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM表现优异但仍存在幻觉问题，现有方法对句子级生成效果不佳或依赖领域知识，自一致性方法虽有效但计算代价高。本研究关注自一致性方法中的冗余问题。

Method: 提出Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP)，基于共享前缀令牌冗余分析，通过选择性推断与退火解码加速多响应生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，DMP可以在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下将生成速度提高至3倍。

Conclusion: DMP是一种独立于模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线的高效生成方法，具有扩展对齐和推理任务的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Conclusion: 验证了自回归预训练与最后一词池化相结合的代码嵌入模型在检索和跨语言应用中具有很高的效率和准确性。

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical

non-English contexts. We present an updated version of the BLUEX dataset, now
including 2024-2025 exams and automatically generated image captions using
state-of-the-art models, enhancing its relevance for data contamination studies
in LLM pretraining. Captioning strategies increase accessibility to text-only

the number in the original BLUEX. We evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs
and their ability to leverage visual context through captions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's

showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and

TL;DR: 本文重新审视图灵测试，通过统计学上对“正常性”的理解，提出图灵测试更适合测试普通/平均人类智能而非卓越智能，并探讨其限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图灵测试的本质及其与“正常性”概念的关联，强调智能的常态定义对人工智能评估的意义。

Method: 通过理论分析，重新诠释图灵测试的目标与判定标准，结合“正常性”和统计学的视角，提出AI设计与人类认知研究的新见解。

Result: 图灵测试关注普通人类智能，现有的大型语言模型如ChatGPT更倾向于模仿卓越智能，反而难以通过图灵测试。同时，探讨图灵测试在认知研究中的适用性。

Conclusion: 图灵测试是评估普通人类智能的工具，但是否能够揭示人类认知本质需要更深入的讨论，大型语言模型更符合“人工智慧”而非“人工智能”的定义。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本摘要评估方法在可重复性和与人类判断的一致性上存在问题，需要开发更透明和可靠的方法。

Method: 对六种典型的评估方法（如ROUGE及基于LLM的新方法G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行实验，在SummEval数据集上比较其性能，并开发一个开源框架以支持公平评估。

Result: 发现评价指标中，那些与人类判断一致性较高的往往在计算上更耗时且运行稳定性较差，同时基于LLM的方法存在随机性和重复性差的问题。

Conclusion: 提出需采用更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽的文档记录和方法的标准化，以提高自动文本摘要评估的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Result: 测试结果表明，研究逻辑中的缺陷对ARGs输出的审稿意见没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 作者基于研究结果提出三项可操作建议，同时公开了数据集和评估框架供后续研究使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有方法使用预定义的语义维度，难以捕获细致的概念区分，因此需要更细粒度的语义表示和分析框架。

Method: 提出了一个解缠连续语义表示模型（DCSRM），将大型语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个语义子嵌入，这些子嵌入编码具体语义信息。随后通过体素编码模型评估这些子维度与大脑活动的对应关系。

Result: 该模型成功识别了一组可解释的语义子维度，并发现极性是驱动语义维度分解的关键因素，这些子维度与大脑活动具有一致的神经相关性。

Conclusion: 本研究为语义概念的更细粒度表示提供了新方式，并验证这些表示在认知和神经科学上的可行性，揭示了语义维度的内在结构规律。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

*Xiaolong Wei,Bo Lu,Xingyu Zhang,Zhejun Zhao,Dongdong Shen,Long Xia,Dawei Yin*

TL;DR: 针对小型语言模型（SLM），本文提出了两种强化学习方法，以提高其中文问候生成的创造性写作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在创造性写作方面表现优异，但其高计算需求限制了应用范围，因此需要探索优化小型语言模型（SLMs）以实现更易于使用和成本较低的创造性输出。

Method: 提出了基于强化学习从 AI 反馈（RLAIF）的两种奖励策略：一是通过新颖的多代理拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型（RM），二是使用原则指导的大语言模型即法官（LLM-as-a-Judge）结合反射机制优化奖励函数。

Result: 研究发现，两种方法均能够显著提升SLM的创造性输出，其中LLM-as-a-Judge策略在生成质量、训练效率及对人工标注数据的依赖方面表现更为优越。

Conclusion: 原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法是提升小型语言模型创造力的更高效、可拓展的途径，并且与人工评估高度一致，实现路径具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心理偏差人们容易相信和传播社交媒体上的假新闻，现有的基于机器学习的事实核查系统在应对此问题时面临如何选取多样性模型的挑战。

Method: 提出一种新的自动分类器选择方法，利用层次聚类评估分类器之间的多样性，分组后通过多样性和性能评估指标筛选最优分类器池进行集成构建。

Result: 在六个不同领域的数据集上的实验中，与最优和基准方法相比，新方法在两个数据集上取得了最高准确率。

Conclusion: 方法有效集成了多元分类器，提升了假新闻检测系统的性能，同时验证了多样性在构建鲁棒模型中的重要性。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

TL;DR: 引入了一种名为Middo的新框架，通过模型感知的数据选择和上下文保持的数据优化，提高了大语言模型的训练效果和其对数据的利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大语言模型(SFT LLM)对高质量数据需求的逐步提高，当前数据选择与合成方法存在的限制未能动态更新以适应模型能力，提出了新的解决方法。

Method: 设计了一个自我进化框架Middo，该框架建立了闭环优化系统，通过三轴模型信号识别次优样本并进行语义保持优化，然后动态调整以配合模型能力的变化。

Result: 实验表明Middo能在多个基准数据集上平均提高模型准确性7.15%，且不扩大数据集规模。

Conclusion: Middo框架为可持续的大语言模型训练提供了一种动态且协同进化的数据和模型优化新模式。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs融入日常工作流程，研究不同人格类型用户的偏好可帮助更好地优化模型和用户体验。

Method: 对32名参与者根据Keirsey人格类型分组，测试他们与GPT-4和Claude 3.5在四种协同任务中的交互表现，结合情感分析和反馈。

Result: 发现具有不同人格特质的用户对LLMs的偏好差异显著：Rationals倾向于选择GPT-4，而Idealists更偏好Claude 3.5。

Conclusion: 人格特质影响了用户对LLMs的偏好，为更个性化的模型设计提供了重要依据，同时传统评价方法可能无法揭示这种差异性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Method: 提出了统一的多任务框架，包括数据转化方案（扩大训练数据多样性）和两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。同时，基于LLM的合成数据管道引入了转述、增强及反例生成技术。

Result: 模型在MTEB、CMTEB基准上排名第一（截至2025年8月27日），并在reranking、聚类等任务上达成SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 高质量、更多样化的数据对于提升检索模型性能至关重要，而利用大语言模型生成能力能够进一步优化嵌入模型效果。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

Motivation: 误导性可视化违背了图表设计原则，导致读者得出错误结论。当前缺乏用于训练和评估AI模型的多样化、开放数据集。

Method: 提出了Misviz数据集（包含2,604个真实世界可视化，标注有12种误导类型）以及Misviz-synth（基于真实数据表生成的81,814个合成可视化）。对多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统和细调分类器进行了综合评估。

Result: 现有最先进模型在此任务上表现仍具有较大挑战。

Conclusion: 论文通过发布Misviz、Misviz-synth数据集和相关代码，为误导性可视化检测任务提供了重要资源，但性能仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于超级语言模型（LLMs）监督微调的新方法，称为核心参数隔离微调（CPI-FT），以缓解任务间的干扰和遗忘问题，从而提升多任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法存在“跷跷板现象”，即在更新参数时，某些任务的性能提升会以其他任务性能下降为代价。

Method: 提出了CPI-FT框架，先通过独立微调确定各任务的核心参数区域，再通过这些参数区域的重叠将任务分组并联合建模。采用参数融合技术，核心参数直接移植，非核心参数通过球面线性插值（SLERP）平滑整合，并通过轻量化流水线式训练阶段处理混合任务数据，同时冻结核心区域防止遗忘。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个公共基准上显著减轻了任务间的干扰和遗忘问题，性能优于传统的多任务和多阶段微调方法。

Conclusion: CPI-FT是一种有效的框架，通过核心参数区域的隔离和融合，成功解决了多任务微调中的干扰和遗忘问题，提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

Motivation: 研究者希望探索大型语言模型在推理密集型回归任务中的表现，以及开发针对性方法以弥补它们在这些任务中的不足。

Method: 通过对三个实际问题的转化，建立RiR任务的基准；验证以提示优化和Transformer微调为代表的现有方法的局限性，提出了一种结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习的MENTAT方法。

Result: MENTAT在基准任务中相比现有方法取得了高达65%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MENTAT为解决数据有限的推理密集型回归任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，但该领域仍有广泛的发展潜力。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Method: 通过使用联合推理和答案对数似然的PiCSAR评分，并自然分解为推理信心和答案信心，无需额外的训练。

Result: PiCSAR在多个基准测试中实现了显著的性能提升，例如在MATH500和AIME2025基准上分别提升了10.18和9.81分，在20次比较中有16次表现优于基线，且实现了至少2倍的高效抽样。

Conclusion: PiCSAR有效利用推理和答案信心的高关联性，提供了一种简单、无需训练的方法来增强推理任务的准确性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个框架LINKO，运用大语言模型（LLM）结合多种医学本体图进行知识传播，提升医学概念表示的学习能力，并在有限数据和罕见疾病预测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于单一或孤立的多本体系统的知识整合，忽略了本体间的交互关系，导致医学概念表示学习的局限性。

Method: LINKO框架通过两步提升医学概念学习：1）用LLM初始化嵌入，并结合本体上下文；2）在本体图中沿垂直和水平两个轴进行知识传播，以同时整合单一本体层级关系和多本体之间的交互。

Result: 通过两个公开数据集验证，LINKO在现有基线模型上表现领先，尤其在数据不足及罕见疾病预测场景中提升明显。

Conclusion: LINKO作为可插入的编码器框架，与现有EHR预测模型兼容，能有效利用跨本体知识，增强医学概念的表示能力及预测性能。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

*Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Yuan Sui,Zining Zhu,Yifan Lu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法TiG，通过与游戏环境的直接交互，帮助大型语言模型(LLMs)从声明性知识转化为程序性知识，显著优化其在交互任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但在简单交互任务中表现不佳，这反映了其声明性知识与程序性知识之间的差距，而传统的强化学习方法难以妥善弥补这一差距。

Method: TiG将基于强化学习的决策制定重新表述为语言建模任务：由LLMs生成语言指导的策略，并通过环境反馈进行在线迭代优化。

Result: TiG在保持LLMs推理能力的同时，使其在程序性任务中取得了可竞争的表现，同时减少了数据和计算需求。

Conclusion: TiG不仅弥合了声明性与程序性知识之间的鸿沟，还通过提供自然语言解释提高了决策的透明性与可解释性，对复杂交互任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AHELM基准测试，以综合评估音频-语言模型（ALMs）的性能，并提供标准化的评估方法和统一的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ALMs缺乏标准化的基准测试，难以全面评估模型性能和比较模型之间的差异。

Method: 引入AHELM基准测试，整合多种数据集，包括新的音频文本数据集（PARADE和CoRe-Bench），评估ALMs在10个重要方面的表现，同时标准化提示词、推理参数和评估指标。

Result: 测试了14种ALMs以及3种基线系统，表明某些模型在多个方面表现优异，但存在偏见和安全性问题。基线系统性能也较为优秀。

Conclusion: AHELM为评估和比较ALMs提供了一个全面和可扩展的基准，有助于推动此类模型的公平性和安全性改进。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了不同的遗忘操作，从语法遗忘到信念集收缩，再到更复杂的语义遗忘，并综合比较了遗忘操作在不同语境的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类或机器智能中，有时需要选择性遗忘知识，例如简化问题或确保隐私。

Method: 以Spohn的排名函数为基础，提出五种遗忘模式和七种具体操作，并基于逻辑编程和AGM理论的遗忘公理对这些操作进行评估。

Result: 提出一套全面的遗忘操作框架，并根据遗忘公理对遗忘操作进行详细比较，阐明不同操作的异同。

Conclusion: 本文为知识遗忘操作提供了更丰富的语义视角，在清晰理论框架下推动了遗忘研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从状态-动作轨迹中学习改进后的STRIPS+模型的方法，解决了状态和动作信息不完整性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的模型学习方法多假设轨迹中的动作具有完整的STRIPS信息或领域谓词全部可观测。提出更“真实”的设置，状态信息和动作信息均存在不完全性。

Method: 引入STRIPS+模型，允许隐式参数和有限形式的存在量词，提出SYNTH算法生成一系列前提表达式，完成STRIPS+模型学习。

Result: 证明了SYNTH算法在STRIPS+学习问题上的正确性和完备性，并测试了其在改造的STRIPS+模型上的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 研究拓展了STRIPS模型学习的范围，使得方法适用于更真实的场景，提供了一种处理不完整信息状态和动作的有效框架。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Motivation: 设计一个基准（MMSearch-Plus）来弥补现有多模态网页浏览基准的不足，解决精细视觉推理、信息溯源验证和长时间工具使用中的挑战。

Method: 提出了一个包含311个任务的基准，基于时空外推结构，并提供了模型无关的代理框架及评估工具，以测试不同模型的多模态理解性能。

Result: 最强模型在引入搜索后准确率提升至36.0%，开源模型在20轮搜索后的准确率为6.9%，揭示了解决多模态任务中的多重问题。

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus揭示了当前多模态语言模型在复杂任务中的局限性，并提供了更高难度的测试环境和多维度评估方式。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: 研究将智慧形式化为多维和意识到不确定性的构造，通过Z数字进行操作化，不仅推进心理学测量，还为AI系统提供可解释且具备信心敏感性的智慧推理能力。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Conclusion: 提出的反事实场景解释方法实用且高效，可扩展反事实解释在自动规划中的作用，具有实际算法设计的价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 通用地标框架能发现领域信息，适用于不同规模的实例，减少数据需求，并具有可解释性，对自动规划有重要意义。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将许多高水平的多智能体规划问题（例如多机器人导航和路径规划）建模为确定性动作和观测问题。

Method: 定义了Det-Dec-POMDPs，并提出基于Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies框架的迭代算法(IDPP)。

Result: IDPP能够有效解决现有Dec-POMDP求解器难以处理的大规模Det-Dec-POMDP问题。

Conclusion: 这项研究为大规模确定性多智能体规划问题提供了新的解决方法。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂优化输出难以被商业利益相关者理解的问题，同时提供交互性和可解释性。

Method: 使用混合整数公式进行战术库存再分配的优化，通过AI代理、RESTful API和动态用户界面实现实时交互和配置更新。

Result: 在案例研究中，该系统有效防止了缺货，降低了成本，并保持了服务水平。

Conclusion: 该方法桥接了运筹优化与商业需求之间的鸿沟，且未来可以通过集成私有LLMs等提高系统性能。

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了A-MHA*算法，将MHA*扩展为可以快速找到次优解并持续改进的实时版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多启发式搜索算法MHA*无法改进初始单次解的问题，意图通过引入实时特性提高算法性能。

Method: 借鉴Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*)算法的概念，对MHA*进行扩展，使其具备在时间限制下不断提高解质量的能力。

Result: 在三维路径规划和滑动拼图问题中测试了A-MHA*的性能，与MHA*及其他实时算法相比表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩展后的A-MHA*算法不仅保持了原有子最优性和完整性的保证，同时显著提升了算法的实时表现。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MEDLEY的框架，旨在通过利用多样性的AI模型促进医学诊断，并把AI系统的偏差当作一种资源而非缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为AI中的偏差是需要消除的，但作者强调这些偏差可能是不可避免且有价值的，模仿了人类推理中偏差的特性。

Method: 提出了MEDLEY框架，通过整合多个AI模型的输出，但保留其多样性，记录模型特定的偏差，并将生成的可能错误（幻觉）视为需要医生验证的暂定假设。还通过超过30种大型语言模型开发了概念验证演示。

Result: 框架在合成病例中成功保留了共识和少数意见，使诊断的不确定性和潜在偏差更加透明，为临床监督提供了便利。

Conclusion: MEDLEY重新定义了AI的“不完美”，将其视为一种资源，并提出了在监管、伦理与创新方面的新的发展方向。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了科学文档的层级结构，以及文本和视觉元素的语义结合，作者旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入了Poster Tree作为层级中间表示，采用具有内容总结与布局规划的多代理协作策略，通过多轮反馈优化逻辑一致性、内容保真度和视觉连贯性。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验中，该方法在定性和定量评价中均优于现有基线方法，生成的海报接近专家水准，信息保留度高，结构清晰，用户偏好度高。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架展示了无需训练的科学海报生成的潜力，在逻辑一致性和视觉呈现质量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种用于解决旅行商问题的变分算法，表现出对中等规模问题的出色泛化能力，但在规模扩展性上存在限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用变分量子算法优化旅行商问题的解决方案，同时降低硬件需求和计算成本。

Method: 利用紧凑排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略，通过模拟退火优化电路拓扑，并以冻结后的拓扑快速重新优化电路参数。

Result: 对于4至7城市的对称问题实例，获取最优路径的成功率分别为100%、90%、80%和约20%。结果表明在中等问题规模上有较好泛化能力，但在扩展性方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 变分算法在旅行商问题中表现出显著的计算效率和解决质量，并通过冻结电路结构大幅减少了时间消耗，但需关注其扩展性和复杂问题适应性。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨如何利用专家知识中的总结因果图(SCG)，在存在因果未知结构时，对时间序列的因果关系进行推断和边缘定向。


<details>

Motivation: 时间序列分析的核心挑战是理解时间变量之间的因果关系，特别是在完全因果结构未知的情况下。专家虽无法提供完整的因果图，但通过总结因果图能够抓住主要因果关系，抽象掉微观的细节。

Method: 提出一系列条件，在拥有总结因果图和忠实、因果充分的分布知识前提下，阐明如何保证时间变量在微观层面的边缘可定向性。结果特别讨论了宏观层面的循环或双向边影响下的微观层面理论保证。

Result: 实现了微观层次上边缘方向的理论保证，即使在宏观层次存在循环或双向边时也适用。这种方法赋予结合总结因果图以提升观测型时间序列数据因果推断的实践指导价值。

Conclusion: 综上，结合总结因果图和专家知识，可以提高复杂时间系统中因果发现的效果，并提供重要的实用指导。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种叫Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)的新方法，用于零样本测试时的规划，在三种任务中表现优于当前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统规划中梯度指引在非凸、不连续、多目标问题中的局限性，以及当前监督式规划需要任务特定训练或估值器的问题。

Method: 提出一种基于树搜索的双层采样方法：第一层通过无训练的粒子引导生成多样化轨迹；第二层通过条件去噪快速优化轨迹。

Result: TDP在迷宫寻金、机械臂操作、及AntMaze多目标探索三类任务中均显著超过现有技术。

Conclusion: TDP能在非凸和复杂场景中更好地探索解空间，仅利用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，展示出强大的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 本研究引入了一种模拟临床团队诊断的多代理系统，通过模拟SOAP笔记的主观和客观部分来识别临床问题，系统表现优于单代理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对单一模型在高风险临床任务中的鲁棒性不足问题，作者提出了一种协作多代理系统，模拟临床团队的推理过程以提高诊断分析的准确性和解释性。

Method: 构建一个以Manager代理为核心，动态分配多个专家代理的多代理系统。这些代理通过分层和迭代的辩论机制对信息进行综合分析，模拟临床诊断过程。系统在MIMIC-III数据集中对比单代理模型进行性能评估。

Result: 多代理系统在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症等问题上性能优于单代理基线模型；定性分析显示该结构能有效平衡和分析冲突证据但存在一定的集体思维风险。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队推理，多代理系统为开发更准确、鲁棒和易解释的临床决策支持工具提供了一条新路径。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

<details>

Motivation: 传统人工智能在医疗中主要用于结果预测，无法满足医疗干预的决策需求；RL通过长期回报优化，有潜力实现真正的临床智能化。

Method: 以RL为核心，通过整合多源医疗数据（如生命体征、化验结果、临床笔记等），分析RL技术的不同方法（如基于模型和无模型的方法）、适配医疗约束的策略设计和部署机制。

Result: 总结当前RL在医疗中的应用，包括危重病管理、慢性病、心理健康诊断和机器人辅助等领域，并指出现存的趋势、鸿沟及瓶颈问题。

Conclusion: RL在医疗领域不仅是工具的进化，更是实现临床人机交互智能的关键，未来需要关注伦理问题和安全性设计，以及如何更好适配人类需求的智能决策系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关注EEG情感识别领域中现有研究局限于二元情感分类与特定个体分类，缺乏广泛适用性和实际部署能力，因此提出了一个统一的多粒度EEG情感分类框架。

Method: 通过预处理策略（包括时间窗口分割、统计与频域特征提取及z-score标准化）对EEG信号进行转换，提出了三种分类方法：二元情感分类、多分类以及细粒度多标签分类，测试了多种传统与深度学习模型。

Result: 实验结果显示LSTM-GRU模型在所有任务中表现优异，其二元情感分类的F1评分为0.932，多分类准确率为94.5%，多标签分类准确率为90.6%。

Conclusion: LSTM-GRU模型在EEG情感识别的多任务上具有显著优势，所提出框架增强了实用性与普适性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Conclusion: PVPO有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过技术改进提升了效率与性能，适合广泛应用。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: 提出AdaGram优化器，通过快速对称分解和矩阵积分方法实现了高效的全矩阵自适应梯度更新，且在标准任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法受限于对角预条件矩阵，无法充分捕捉参数间的相关性，而全矩阵方法尽管有效，但计算和内存成本过高。

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，结合快速对称分解和低秩结构矩阵积分的方法，降低内存和计算开销，实现全矩阵自适应梯度更新。

Result: 实验表明，AdaGram在使用低秩（如秩为5）近似时，可以比对角线优化器更快收敛或取得相当性能。

Conclusion: AdaGram提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，为大型模型中的自适应优化提供更高效和关联建模能力。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

TL;DR: 研究旨在使用机器学习和强化学习技术对NASA深空网络（DSN）设施中的多变量时间序列数据进行异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升NASA深空网络的维护效率及设备健康监控，降低因设备退化带来的数据中断风险。

Method: 采用预测分析的机器学习模型识别异常数据，使用强化学习对异常分类，并利用大语言模型提供解释；此外，设计了DSN数据管道系统以连接数据提取、解析及处理流程。

Result: 构建了一个完整的数据工作流，能对DSN天线和发射器数据实现异常检测，并为未来流程改进奠定基础。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种AI技术，显著改善了DSN设备检测的自动化和决策支持能力，可进一步服务于未来空间任务。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出将大语言模型（LLMs）路由问题建模为上下文 bandit问题，通过动态选择适合的模型优化查询处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的能力和成本差异对应用程序路径选择造成挑战，传统的监督学习方法难以处理真实场景中用户不断变化的查询和不完整的查询-模型映射问题。

Method: 研究提出了一种名为PILOT的方法，将查询和LLM嵌入对齐到共享空间，通过离线人类偏好数据预先训练，再使用Bandit反馈进行在线调整; 并引入适应用户预算的在线成本策略。

Result: PILOT在优化资源的同时实现了适应性的路由决策，解决了不完整查询-模型信息带来的难题。

Conclusion: 通过结合 Bandit建模与成本控制，PILOT有效提升了LLM路由的灵活性与效率，适应了动态用户需求及成本限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析合成数据公开后训练数据隐私可能泄露的问题，同时克服以往方法的假设局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Gen-LRA的No-Box Membership Inference Attack方法，无需模型知识或访问权限，通过评估局部似然比的影响来检测隐私泄露。

Result: 在多样的数据集、模型和攻击参数的基准测试中，Gen-LRA方法在多个性能指标上都优于其他攻击方法。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA是一种高效的隐私审计工具，能够揭示生成模型因过拟合导致的隐私风险，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs方法能有效提升ESNs的长时信息处理能力，提供更强的时间建模与记忆能力，是对传统ESNs的显著改进。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的树集成遗忘算法局限性较大，难以广泛适应复杂模型和大规模数据集。

Method: 将遗忘问题表述为基于梯度的优化任务，通过概率模型近似克服树集成的不可导性，实现端到端的高效遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，FUTURE在真实数据集上的遗忘性能显著且成功。

Conclusion: FUTURE为树集成的有效遗忘提供了一种通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

TL;DR: 本文分析大语言模型中的解码步骤，总结为概率单纯形上的受约束变分原理，并揭示了相关的动力学特性及其实践意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为正式描述大语言模型解码中的“概率分布流形遍历”直觉，并探讨与软性归一化和多种采样方法相关的动态属性。

Method: 通过将解码步骤表述为概率单纯形上的受约束变分原理，使用经典的乘法权重更新和其连续时间极限（复制器流）进行分析，并结合温度、top-k与核采样等因素讨论其影响。

Result: 发现了解码步骤下一次预测分布遵循平滑轨迹，并收敛于softmax平衡；温度对轨迹起线性重新定标作用，top-k和核采样限定轨迹但保持平衡特性。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型输出分布的动力学分析提供了严谨基础，并对模型解码行为及采样策略的影响进行了细致刻画，未来工作将探讨训练动态和内部表示。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

TL;DR: 对大语言模型(LLMs)应用强化学习(RL)的一些反直觉现象存在于预训练模型任务对齐度较高的情况下，而在更加挑战的设置中这些技术无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中的一些反直觉现象（如单一数据可等效整个数据集、负样本训练优于奖励方法等）的适用条件。

Method: 通过系统性实验评估不同模型架构和任务领域下的大量反直觉现象，并探讨模型任务对齐度（以pass@k准确率衡量）对结果的影响。

Result: 发现许多反直觉结果仅在LLMs与任务具有强任务对齐度时出现，而在更具挑战性状况中，传统的RL方法依然更为有效。

Conclusion: 模型任务对齐度是影响RL技术表现的重要因素；标准的RL方法在更复杂场景下具有持续稳定的表现优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于自组织映射（SOM）和变分自编码器（VAE）的生成型持续学习框架，用于实现内存高效复现，消除存储原始数据样本或任务标签的需求，并在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上显著超过现有方法约10%和7%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对传统持续学习方法在处理高维度数据输入时对内存和计算资源的高需求以及对存储原始数据和任务标签的依赖。

Method: 框架结合SOM和VAE，设计两种方法：高维输入时SOM操作在VAE的潜在空间上，低维数据时SOM独立运行。通过存储SOM单元的均值、方差和协方差进行合成样本生成，并用于后续学习迭代。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100的基准测试上，方法性能与当前高水平记忆基方法持平，并显著优于无记忆方法，在单类别增量学习中表现提升了近10%（CIFAR-10）和7%（CIFAR-100）。

Conclusion: 本方法具备可扩展性、无任务标签、内存高效的特点，同时支持学习过程可视化及生成模型应用，适合作为生成型持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为Mixture of Experts (MoE) 的混合专家元学习框架，结合三种异质的最先进代理模型以提高CFD模拟精度并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD（计算流体动力学）模拟的计算成本严重限制了汽车设计和优化的效率，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出一种MoE架构，通过引入专门的门控网络动态地将三种先进代理模型（DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet和FigConvNet）的预测进行优化组合，同时加入熵正则化项提高模型平衡性。

Result: 实验证明，MoE模型在DrivAerML数据集上的L-2预测误差显著降低，优于单一专家模型和简单平均组合。

Conclusion: MoE框架通过整合多架构长处，大幅提升了复杂代理模型的可靠性和预测精度，为流体力学模拟问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了名为RelP的新方法，通过结合激活补丁技术与基于LRP的传播系数，提高了局部相关性分析结果的可靠性与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活补丁法用于定位模型中特定行为的关键组件，但计算成本高；归因补丁法较快但在深度非线性网络中不够可靠，因此需要更准确高效的方案。

Method: 提出RelP方法，用LRP生成的传播系数代替归因补丁中的局部梯度，从而在两次前向和一次后向传播内实现高效改进。

Result: RelP方法显著提高了近似激活补丁的准确性（如用于GPT-2 Large时，与归因补丁的相关性提升至0.956）；还与综合梯度法（IG）达到相似的可靠性，无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: RelP方法兼顾高效性与可靠性，改进了激活补丁分析精度，并在复杂任务和模型中验证了其实用价值。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

TL;DR: 提出FedOwen框架，通过Owen采样有效地近似Shapley值，同时采用自适应客户端选择策略提升联邦学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估每个客户端的贡献对于确保公平奖励和优化客户端选择以加速全局模型收敛至关重要，而计算Shapley值的高成本是需要解决的挑战。

Method: 设计FedOwen框架，结合Owen采样近似计算Shapley值，同时采用自适应客户端选择策略，平衡高价值客户端的利用和低数据采样客户端的探索。

Result: 在固定的评估成本下，与现有先进方法相比，FedOwen在非均匀数据(NIID)基准测试中实现最高23%的最终精度提升，同时在相同通信轮数内表现更优。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效和准确地估计客户端价值，并改善了客户端选择策略，有效地提升了联邦学习模型的收敛速度和性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

TL;DR: G&L方法测量机器学习模型从头学习过程中的冷启动适应能力，通过累计计算初期标签预测错误数量，揭示模型的适应速度和选择质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习评估更侧重于最终精度，忽略了初次适应过程中产生的累计错误。这个研究旨在揭示并量化这种冷启动阶段的适应性差距。

Method: 提出Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0方法，定义了Scratch/Pretrained与Online/Batch组合模式，通过MNIST与AG News上的一系列基线实验对冷启动阶段的错误成本进行量化分析。

Result: 从实验中发现，小模型在冷启动阶段的初始错误较少，而预训练的表现因领域而异。但所有当前模型在适应性上均优于估计的理论基准“oracle band”。

Conclusion: 这种方法为现有评估工具提供补充，强调了模型在学习初期的可靠性和适应能力，为构建更全面的机器学习评估框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效应对了动态环境中异常检测的挑战，展示了持续微调与LLM的结合在提升检测性能上的潜力。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MyGO的新型终身学习框架，无需存储真实数据，通过生物启发的唤醒-睡眠机制显著缓解灾难性遗忘，并在多个任务中保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的终身学习方法面临着数据隐私、存储限制以及处理不相似任务时的性能下降问题，需要新的方法解决这些挑战。

Method: 设计了一种名为MyGO的框架，包括“唤醒”和“睡眠”两阶段。在唤醒阶段学习新任务并训练生成模型G-mem捕捉数据分布；在睡眠阶段，通过知识提炼利用G-mem生成伪数据进行知识整合，避免存储原始数据。

Result: 在计算机视觉（Split-MNIST）和自然语言处理（Split-AG News）基准测试中，MyGO表现出显著的抗遗忘能力和高平均准确性。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，兼顾隐私与存储效率，具有良好的跨领域通用性。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为VILA的新框架，改进了FILA存在的问题，提升了参数效率和训练速度，同时在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM由于敏感信息生成问题导致的高昂重新训练成本，探索更高效的机器遗忘方法。

Method: 基于FILA的方法，提出改进的VILA框架，通过优化Fisher信息假设进行更准确的参数识别，同时减少模型访问需求和计算成本。

Result: 相比FILA，VILA参数效率提高至100倍，训练速度提高至40倍，并在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试上实现了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VILA提供了一种更高效、精准的敏感信息移除方式，为机器遗忘领域带来了显著提升。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出对Q学习强化学习算法的收敛进行理论分析，并定义了一种名为RASQL的变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前Q学习算法的实际收敛性，特别是涉及递归式更新和策略正则化两大特点的场景。

Method: 提出RASQL算法，并从理论上分析其收敛性，同时提供数值实验验证。

Result: RASQL在温和的技术条件下能收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，实验表现验证与理论一致。

Conclusion: 理论和实验表明RASQL在策略正则化和递归更新情况下具有收敛性，并扩展到周期性策略的学习场景中。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Sampled-SAE的方法，通过在批次激活的特征选择上引入可调参数来改进现有的BatchTopK方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TopK SAE和BatchTopK在处理稀疏编码时存在效率限制和信息丢失问题，需要更好地平衡全局一致性和细粒度重建之间的权衡。

Method: 通过引入Sampled-SAE方法，在批次激活矩阵中，通过对特征列评分并形成候选池，再在候选池中选择Top-K特征，调整l参数以控制全局与局部特性的平衡。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型实验中，不同的l值可以调节全局结构、一致性重建与下游性能之间的平衡，有效提升方法的灵活性与适应性。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新定义为一个可调节的、分布感知的特征选择家族，提供更好的性能权衡与方法适配。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

Motivation: 本文旨在应对长时间序列生成中的挑战，特别是对长时序依赖与数据分布漂移之间的平衡以及特征序列间复杂关系的建模。这些问题对准确高效的长时间序列建模至关重要。

Method: 提出了Stage-Diff，基于扩散模型，采用阶段化生成与跨阶段信息传递保持时序依赖，同时通过序列分解实现通道独立建模，并结合多通道融合以平衡复杂的序列依赖关系。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，Stage-Diff能够有效生成长时间序列，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过分阶段生成和多通道融合建模成功解决了长时间序列生成的关键问题，是一种高效的生成方法。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列生成方法难以保证生成序列的时间依赖性，且直接基于随机序列建模难以准确捕获原始时间序列的特征信息。

Method: 通过双层生成对抗网络（DLGAN）分解时间序列生成过程为序列特征提取和序列重建两个阶段，同时结合自动编码器和GAN实现特征监督学习和特征对齐。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验证明，该模型在多个评估指标上具有优越性。

Conclusion: DLGAN通过创新性地分解生成过程和结合监督与对抗学习，有效提升了时间序列数据生成的质量和时间依赖性保障。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化算法AHTSGD，该算法通过动态调节注入优化器中的噪声，更好地处理神经网络训练中的锐点现象和宽谷问题，从而加速收敛和改进泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化算法在神经网络训练中往往过于依赖训练损失，导致泛化能力较差。通过引入更宽的损失谷底可以更稳定响应输入数据或模型参数的小变化，从而改进泛化能力。

Method: 基于梯度噪声的重尾分布和神经网络训练中的稳定性边缘现象，提出了AHTSGD算法。在训练初期注入更重尾的噪声以增强探索能力，随着训练收敛逐步调整为更轻尾的噪声。

Result: AHTSGD在MNIST和CIFAR-10等基准测试上优于SGD及其他噪声注入方法，尤其在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现出显著提升，同时对学习率设置具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AHTSGD首次根据稳定性边缘现象调整优化器噪声的特性，加速早期训练并改进泛化，在噪声和干净环境下均表现出色。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Result: 发现棋力和解谜能力随层次增长，但策略轨迹不平滑，存在早发现后丢弃的解和输出策略排名差异。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示在政策网络上的演化非平滑，与语言模型的分布收敛形成对比。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: CoM在标准基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CoM通过有效缓解协变量偏移，成功地解决了无需重训练情况下的模型合并问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Result: 算法在具有挑战性的模拟环境下表现优异，优于传统的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 提出的新算法能够兼顾集合期望和时间平均增长率，为优化个体轨迹的长期表现提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: CByG框架在实际药物发现中更为高效且实用，表明其在综合评估和引导分子生成方面具有巨大的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大语言模型(LLMs)在处理不同地区的贷款审批数据集时的性能和公平性，以及数据序列化格式对结果的影响，其中某些格式如GReat和LIFT表现较优但加剧了不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险决策场景（如贷款审批）中的应用越来越广泛，但在处理表格数据、确保公平性和提供可靠预测方面存在难题。

Method: 通过测试LLMs在三个地理区域（加纳、德国和美国）的贷款审批数据集上的零样本学习和上下文内学习（ICL）能力，并分析序列化格式对性能和公平性的影响。

Result: ICL相较于零样本学习提升了模型性能（高达59.6%），但序列化格式（如GReat和LIFT）虽提高F1分数，却可能加剧公平性问题。

Conclusion: 改进表格数据表示方法和开发关注公平性的模型对于提升LLMs在金融决策中的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Motivation: 旨在探讨贝叶斯无模型强化学习中后验估计的假设准确性问题，并指出当前研究多集中于增强后验近似精度而非假设本身的准确性。

Method: 研究了贝叶斯强化学习的冷后验效应，分析了先验分布和似然假设，并通过统计测试检验常见假设（如高斯似然）的有效性，提出了适配性更好的改进方案。

Result: 发现高斯似然假设经常被违反，证明改良的先验和似然假设能提升贝叶斯算法性能。

Conclusion: 未来贝叶斯强化学习应着重研究更适合的先验和似然假设机制，改进方案已在深度Q学习中证明有效。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Motivation: 传统早退出模型基于置信度的退出策略，存在低效之处，本文试图通过新的性能预测方式优化此问题。

Method: 将失败预测作为预测早退出模型效率的关键指标，进行多次实验验证并对比校准性指标与失败预测的效果。

Result: 实验表明，以失败预测为依据能够更好地提升早退出模型的效率，并可弥补校准性方法的不足。

Conclusion: 失败预测比传统校准性指标更适合作为早退出模型的设计与评估基础，提升了效率与性能关联的可靠性。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Motivation: 提高Transformer在能量受限设备上的适用性，同时探索SNN在顺序决策中的潜力。

Method: 结合漏积分神经元至自注意力模块，使用代理梯度训练，并加入三因素可塑性、基于脉冲的编码和轻量化的路由模块。

Result: 在经典控制任务中性能优于或匹配传统决策变换器，且每次推断能耗降至四个数量级以下。

Conclusion: 通过结合序列建模和神经形态高效性，SNN-DT为实时低能耗控制提供了一种新方式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了图神经网络（GNN）在解决布尔可满足性问题（SAT）时的局限性，通过图Ricci曲率解释了这些性能瓶颈的几何原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GNN在SAT求解中显示出潜力，但其性能在较难的实例上快速下降，作者试图揭示这是否是由于架构的固有限制。

Method: 作者证明随机k-SAT公式的二分图天然具有负曲率，并随着问题难度的增加而减小。此外，作者将这种现象与GNN中的“过度压缩”联系起来，并通过经验验证了曲率与问题复杂度以及模型性能之间的关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，图Ricci曲率不仅是问题复杂度的强指标，还可以用来预测GNN SAT求解器的性能。

Conclusion: 研究发现了GNN在SAT求解中的几何限制，并提出了未来设计更强GNN模型的方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Method: 提出了一个新的问题表述，分析了多种数据最小化技术，并调查了影响其效果的关键因素。

Result: 验证了在不显著损害推荐系统性能的前提下，数据最小化在技术上是可行的。

Conclusion: 虽然技术上可行，但实践中仍存挑战，因为数据最小化受到技术设置和用户特征的显著影响，使得统一的数据“必要性”标准难以实现。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Method: 通过三个实验（插值分析、交叉验证及轨迹预测），对比了PINNs与XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归。PINNs通过基于物理的损失函数进行训练，确保功率平衡、操作约束及电网稳定性。

Result: PINNs在动态电网操作中的平均绝对误差（MAE）较低，表现出优越的泛化能力，且物理一致性优于传统模型，即便在极端条件下亦相对稳定。

Conclusion: PINNs为智能电网代理提供了新的范式，结合数据驱动的灵活性与从物理原理出发的严谨性，其在实时电网控制和可扩展数字孪生等领域具备广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote

limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Motivation: 希望通过机器学习方法预测社交媒体内容的未来参与度（评论、点赞），探索影响这些社交媒体互动的情感和时间因素。

Method: 使用包含600首歌曲的情感和相关指标的数据，通过HistGradientBoostingRegressor算法对对数变换的参与比率进行多目标回归建模，并采用R^2等标准回归指标评估效果。

Result: 模型对点赞的预测结果为R^2=0.98，而评论的预测结果仅为R^2=0.41，表明点赞与情感和曝光信号高度相关，而评论则受其他额外因素的影响。

Conclusion: 情感、时间元数据与现有的观看计数能有效预测点赞，但评论的预测仍需引入其他特征进一步改进。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

Motivation: 在实际应用中，需确保深度模型的可靠性，因此需要能在训练分布(ID)和分布偏离(OOD)数据间进行区分的方法。

Conclusion: 对分类任务激活空间的不同子空间加以区分利用，并结合成综合法，能显著提升OOD检测性能。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种将纵向回归不连续性设计（LRDD）方法扩展至统计学习框架的新方法，用于预测未来特定时间的精神健康变化，并在美国县级COVID-19事件上验证了该方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公共卫生政策领域需要找到更有效的方法评估局部事件对社区心理健康的影响，但预测心理健康分数本身提供的见解有限，LRDD方法因其对因果效应的洞察提供了新的可能性。

Method: 此研究将传统经济学中的LRDD方法适配到统计学习框架中，利用历史分数、动态协变量和外生变量预测未来的心理健康变化和线性趋势的变化。

Result: 在COVID-19对美国县级焦虑的影响中，结合动态协变量和外生变量的模型表现最佳，相较于传统社区静态表示，方法的预测能力显著提升（不连续性预测：r=+0.46；斜率预测：r=+0.65）。

Conclusion: 本研究证明，将LRDD与统计学习相结合能够用于更准确地预测局部事件对特定社区的潜在心理健康影响，为未来政策制定提供了依据，同时拓展了心理健康研究的新可能性。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: SLAC研究团队开发了SLAC神经网络库（SNL）以及其Python扩展（Auto-SNL），旨在通过在FPGA上部署实时机器学习模型解决1 TB/s数据流实时处理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LCLS-II自由电子激光器所产生的X射线脉冲会导致每秒1TB以上的数据吞吐量，因此需要一种高效的实时数据管理和压缩方法。传统机器学习方法因延迟过高无法满足高速实验需求。

Method: 设计并开发了SLAC神经网络库（SNL），支持动态更新FPGA上的模型权重，无需重新合成。同时推出Auto-SNL工具，用于将Python构建的神经网络模型自动转换为兼容的高层次综合代码。

Result: 在与当前最先进工具hls4ml的基准测试中，SNL在多种神经网络架构和合成配置下表现出竞争力，部分情况下还节约了FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL展现出其在高能物理、医学成像和机器人等领域的多样性潜力，为实时高性能数据处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签排序方法未充分利用正标签排名信息，需创新方法来统一分类和排序任务并适应数据稀缺及标注偏差问题。

Method: 引入UniMLR框架，基于正标签排名建模类别相关性为概率分布，提供8个合成数据集以模拟不同排名因素，并采用统计分析和实验验证方法的效果。

Conclusion: UniMLR成功结合了多标签排序的排名和分类功能，提供了一种有效方法来应对数据不足和标注偏差挑战，显示出实用价值。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效应对了设备和用户异质性问题，改进了心率预测表现，并具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要完整的模态数据或依赖手动选择策略，难以适应真实临床设置中跨患者和机构的数据可用性差异。

Method: 提出MoE-Health架构，使用专家网络和动态门控机制，根据数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现灵活适应不同的数据可用性场景。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三项关键任务（院内死亡预测、长期住院时间预测及再次入院预测）中，MoE-Health显示出优越的性能，并对不同模态可用性模式具有较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoE-Health能有效整合多模态信息，提供更好的预测性能与鲁棒性，特别适合异质数据可用性的多样化医疗环境中应用。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的扩展，调参效率问题变得愈发重要，LoRA通过低秩更新减少可调参数量，但存在现有技术初始化成本高的问题。

Method: 提出QR-LoRA方法，以QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，将LoRA更新表达为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA提供了一种高效且结构清晰的低秩适配技术，大幅减少参数数量同时保持甚至提升性能。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI伦理框架的普及，应对隐私和公平问题成为关键，而合成数据生成是一个有效应对方式。

Method: 提出FLIP方法，利用基于Transformer的变分自编码器，结合隐私保护中的RDP约束和公平性输入空间中基于采样的约束，同时在隐空间使用CKA对比保护组神经元激活模式。

Result: FLIP在多样化下游任务中能在差分隐私约束下显著提高公平性表现。

Conclusion: FLIP为任务无关的公平性与差分隐私下异构表格数据生成提供了重要解决方案，具有较广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.
