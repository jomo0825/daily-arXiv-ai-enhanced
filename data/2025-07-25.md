### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Lumina-mGPT 2.0，这是一种完全从零训练的自回归生成模型，能够在生成质量上与当前扩散模型(DALL-E 3, SANA)媲美，并支持多任务和多模态生成功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成领域主要依赖于预训练组件或混合架构，而本文旨在开发一种自零训练、无需预训练限制的技术，重新激活自回归生成的潜力，同时提供架构自由和许可灵活性。

Method: 采用了从零开始训练的自回归模型架构，引入统一的令牌化策略，并结合了高效解码方法（如推理时缩放和雅可比采样）来提高质量和速度。

Result: 在GenEval和DPG等标准基准测试中，生成质量与扩散模型相当甚至超越，同时在Graph200K等多任务评估中表现优秀。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0被证明是一种强大的灵活基础模型，不仅赋能图像生成，还展现出在多模态生成中的高潜力。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文解决了自动化体育视频分析的挑战，通过提出一个名为SV3.3B的轻量级视频理解模型，实现设备端的高效处理，同时超越了当前大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前体育视频分析对运动细节捕捉不足，且依赖计算密集型的服务器处理模型，难以精准描述运动阶段的细微过渡。

Method: 提出了SV3.3B模型，结合了时间运动差采样与自监督学习，通过DWT-VGG16-LDA机制提取关键帧，并使用预训练的V-DWT-JEPA2编码器和针对体育动作描述生成优化的LLM解码器。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集子集上，SV3.3B在生成技术细节丰富的体育描述能力指标上较GPT-4o取得29.2%的显著提升，同时具备更低的计算资源需求。

Conclusion: SV3.3B在精确分析运动动作、提高信息密度和精细化测量上表现优异，为自动化体育视频分析提供了极具前景的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++是一种无训练框架，通过逐步引入细节（PDI）策略生成更精确、多样的图像，尤其适用于复杂提示的文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成技术面对处理复杂、具有多个主题和不同属性的提示时仍存在困难。

Method: 提出了逐步注入细节（PDI）策略，将复杂提示分解为多个简化子提示分阶段生成，并利用自注意力的布局控制与交叉注意力机制的属性绑定能力。

Result: Detail++在T2I-CompBench和一个新的风格组合基准上表现优越，优于现有方法，尤其在多对象和复杂风格条件下展现卓越效果。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成与属性对齐策略显著提高了复杂提示下文本到图像生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FishDet-M，作为目前最大的鱼类检测基准数据集，整合了13个具有多样化水域环境的数据集并统一内容格式；系统评估了28种现代目标检测模型并提出了一种基于CLIP的模型选择框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决水下鱼类检测数据集零碎、图像条件异质及评估协议不统一的问题，促进生态监测、养殖自动化及机器人视觉的发展。

Method: 构建FishDet-M数据集，包含13个具有多样性的数据来源，采用COCO格式统一标注；评估多种目标检测模型；引入基于CLIP的视觉-语言对齐模型选择框架，以实现动态和高效的模型选择。

Result: FishDet-M上的评测揭示了不同模型在精准度与效率之间的权衡；提出的CLIP框架实现了零样本情况下的高性能动态选择。

Conclusion: FishDet-M数据集和框架为复杂水下场景中物体检测的标准化和可重复性研究提供了新平台，同时提供了支持实时应用的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究使用生成式AI模型LightningDiT评估公开的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性，发现合成数据是一种有前景的方法，但需要保证训练数据的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习技术在皮肤癌筛查中的应用可能引发偏差问题，因此研究如何评估和改善其公平性非常重要。

Method: 利用生成式AI模型LightningDiT生成高质量的合成数据，并进行公平性评估实验。

Result: 结果表明，合成数据评估方法前景可观，但模型训练数据与合成数据的差异会影响评估的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出合成数据作为评估和提升医疗成像系统公平性的潜在方法，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于图像恢复的Transformer架构——DiNAT-IR，通过改进自注意力机制在保持高质量的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer在图像恢复中虽然有效，但计算量大，在高分辨率图像上表现有限，且可能忽略局部细节。研究旨在提出一种兼顾效率与质量的解决方案。

Method: 引入膨胀邻域注意力（DiNA），结合滑窗机制与混合膨胀因子，并加入一个基于通道注意的模块以补充全局上下文与局部像素级精确度。

Result: 所提出的DiNAT-IR在多个基准测试中取得竞争性结果，兼顾了效率和高质量表现。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR能够有效地用于多种低级视觉任务，展示了将全局上下文与局部精确度相结合的潜力。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了自适应特征精炼（AFR）模块，改善UDA-SS任务的分割准确性，通过减少复杂区域的误分类，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法难以在局部细节和全局上下文之间取得平衡，导致复杂区域分割错误，亟需一种新方法解决该问题。

Method: 提出了自适应特征精炼（AFR）模块，通过语义先验精炼高分辨率特征，同时引入高频分量捕获边界信息，并通过不确定性驱动的注意机制自适应平衡局部和全局信息。

Result: 方法在GTA V到Cityscapes任务上提升1.05%mIoU，在Synthia到Cityscapes任务上提升1.04%mIoU。

Conclusion: AFR模块设计轻量化，可无缝集成到HRDA方法中，显著提升UDA-SS性能，达成最新的分割表现。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍一项称为OPEN的数据集，用于老年人在虚拟课程中的参与度识别，这是目前最大的此类数据集，涵盖超35小时的数据，并使用AI方法达到高达81%的参与度识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线教育和虚拟康复领域，参与度对参与者的满意度、表现和坚持性至关重要。然而，现有研究缺乏针对老年群体的虚拟学习参与度研究，特别是在保留隐私数据的情况下进行自动化识别。

Method: 开发了一个名为OPEN的数据集，包含老年人参与虚拟集体学习的行为和情感特征。数据来源于11位老年人的心脏康复课程，结合机器学习和深度学习方法，进行参与度识别研究。

Result: 数据集涵盖超过35小时的虚拟学习数据，标注了参与状态、情感行为以及上下文信息。训练的模型最高实现了81%的参与度识别精度。

Conclusion: OPEN数据集为老年群体的个性化参与度建模提供了基础，推动了更广泛的参与度研究，同时为隐私保护下的AI应用探索了新路径。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用YOLO模型的实时视频分析系统，可自动检测鬃狮蜥的晒太阳和捕猎行为，有效提升研究效率和数据质量，但捕猎行为检测需通过改进来提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的鬃狮蜥行为监测方式费时且易出错，研究欲通过自动化技术提升效率与准确性。

Method: 使用YOLO模型（v5, v7, v8, v11, v12）及自定义的1200张公开数据集来训练，系统通过帧对象坐标提取、时间插值和规则逻辑实现行为分类。

Result: YOLOv8s因其在准确度(mAP@0.5:0.95=0.855)和速度的平衡表现最好。日常晒太阳检测可靠，但弱的蟋蟀检测(mAP@0.5=0.392)限制了捕猎行为的准确性。

Conclusion: 系统提供了一种可扩展的爬行动物行为监测解决方案，对提升数据质量和研究效率具有重要意义，但需优化小物体检测以改进捕猎行为检测的表现。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入了首个空地跨模态视频行人再识别数据集（AG-VPReID.VIR），并提出了一种新颖的三流架构（TCC-VPReID），以解决跨平台和跨模态Re-ID的挑战，显著提升了性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行人再识别数据集主要聚焦于地面视角，缺乏考虑空地间的跨模态Re-ID，而空中视角有效解决了地面系统的视野受限、遮挡等问题。

Method: 提出AG-VPReID.VIR数据集，结合无人机和CCTV的RGB与红外模式，还设计了一个三流网络TCC-VPReID，通过风格鲁棒特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适配和中间引导的时间建模来解决空地间及模态之间的域间差异。

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR数据集的测试展示了其特殊挑战性，TCC-VPReID框架在多种评估协议下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为空地跨模态行人再识别提供了一个全新数据集和有效的解决方案，表现出卓越的性能，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/agvpreid25/AG-VPReID.VIR.

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了标签偏差如何影响医学影像AI中的子群分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨医学影像数据集中标签偏差对AI系统公平性的影响，尤其针对不同比例和可分离性的子群。

Method: 利用深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类实验，实验中模拟了基于成像制造商的可分离子群和伪子群的标签偏差情况。

Result: 发现标签偏差会导致模型特征表示的显著偏移，这种偏移依赖子群大小与可分离性。此外，验证集标签的纯净性对分类性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了标签偏差对医学影像AI子群公平性的潜在影响，为实现公平的医疗AI提供了依据。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章通过严谨数学证明首次明确推导了两Grassmannian特征之间相对于刚体变换(R和t)的可优化代价函数，并提出了基于高维线性子空间基底的可优化距离函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法提供与刚体变换明确函数关系的距离，使得Grassmannian在配准问题中的应用受限。

Method: 提出一种优化代价函数，利用高维线性子空间基底表示，并通过几何测地距离优化以解决表示歧义。

Result: 所提代价函数及其扩展在实现现有方案收敛性改进或超越任务表现上表现出色。

Conclusion: 文中方法在解决表示歧义的同时，通过精确优化地测距离实现了对现有方法的改进，支持多计算机视觉任务中的应用。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

TL;DR: GRR-CoCa通过改进架构显著提升了CoCa模型在视觉与文本任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到当前多模态模型架构落后于LLMs的复杂性，作者旨在提升CoCa在视觉-语言任务中的性能。

Method: 在CoCa模型中加入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根正则化和旋转位置嵌入，并在文本解码器与视觉Transformer编码器中进行集成。

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练数据集和三种微调数据集上全面优于Baseline CoCa，在预训练中对比损失降低27.25%，困惑度改善3.71%，CoCa损失减少7.15%。微调中对比损失、困惑度和CoCa损失分别改善13.66%、5.18%和5.55%。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的架构改进验证了其在视觉-语言领域的性能及泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model

contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的视频DeepFake基准数据集Celeb-DF++，用于检测广泛的未见DeepFake类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DeepFake类型多样化，对未见DeepFake类型的检测提出了巨大挑战，因此需要一个包含多样性伪造类型的大规模数据集。

Method: 基于之前的Celeb-DF数据集，开发了Celeb-DF++，覆盖Face-swap, Face-reenactment和Talking-face三种伪造场景，共包含22种最新DeepFake方法生成的大量高质量伪造视频。

Result: 展示了现有的24种检测方法在新数据集上的泛化能力评测，揭示了现有方法的局限性以及新数据集的挑战性。

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++提供了一个高质量且多样化的视频基准，为DeepFake检测的泛化性研究提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

Method: 提出一个新的3D高斯修复框架，结合自动掩膜优化和区域不确定性导向优化，针对遮挡区域定位和边界修复，以及细节的一致性进行改进。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，本文方法在可视化质量和多视图一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架在3D场景修复领域不仅提高了修复的保真度，也显著改善了多视角的一致性问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViGText，这是一种结合视觉大语言模型文本解释与图神经网络框架的新方法，用于提高深度伪造检测的准确性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术发展迅猛，威胁媒体真实性，而现有的检测方法在处理复杂定制化深伪时缺乏泛化能力和抗攻击能力。

Method: ViGText通过将图像分割为多个patch，构建图像和文本图，并利用图神经网络整合分析。这种方法结合了细致的视觉和文本解释，进行多层次特征提取，捕捉空间和频域细节，以增强检测性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViGText具有显著的泛化性和鲁棒性：F1分数从72.45%提升至98.32%；对特定攻击分类性能下降控制在4%以内。

Conclusion: ViGText通过结合视觉与文本分析，引入图神经网络框架，显著提升深伪检测能力，为维护媒体真实性提供了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

### [18] [Enhancing Scene Transition Awareness in Video Generation via Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18046)
*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于TAV数据集的新方法以提升多场景视频生成中的场景转换理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的生成模型在多场景转换视频生成方面存在不足，源于模型难以从提示中推断何时需要场景转换。

Method: 提出并使用Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，对现有模型进行后期训练以增强其对场景转换的理解能力。

Result: 训练结果表明，TAV数据集提高了模型对提示式场景转换的理解，同时保持了图像质量并缩小了生成场景与所需场景的差距。

Conclusion: TAV数据集有效改善了生成多场景连续视频的能力，特别是场景过渡的理解和生成一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Method: 提出基于物理启发的自注意模块，适配图像形成过程，同时结合深度相关的模糊约束和自遮挡效应，并对扩散模型进行改进以支持一步推理。

Result: 结果显示，方法在质量和保真度上均达到了极高水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在解决配对数据不足问题方面也表现出色，通过合成具有透明特性的真实感前景，实现了真实性与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法依赖预训练模型或低光输入，忽略正常光图像的语义指导，导致在复杂光照环境中的效果受限。

Method: 利用大规模视觉语言模型并结合迭代和手动指令，提出指令先验融合模块动态对齐并融合图像与文本特征，同时改进指令策略以逐步提高增强效果。

Result: 实验显示VLM-IMI在定量指标和感知质量上超越了现有方法，即便在极端低光条件下也能恢复结构细节和语义对齐内容。

Conclusion: 通过引入语义信息和文本指导，该方法显著提升了低光图像增强性能，验证了多模态特征融合对复杂场景恢复的重要性。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌的预后较差，精准诊断依赖于EUS，而现有方法存在噪声、高要求标注及性能瓶颈。需要提出有效的自动分割方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于文本提示学习和LoRA方法的SAM变体，并结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器，表现为高效、轻量级的自动分割方法，优化了原始模型的0.86%参数。

Result: 在公开的胰腺EUS数据库上，TextSAM-EUS在自动提示下获得82.69% Dice和85.28% NSD，手动提示下分别为83.10% Dice和85.70% NSD，优于现有SOTA和基础模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS开创性地在医疗图像分割中引入了基于提示学习的SAM变体，提供了一个高效、鲁棒的胰腺EUS自动分割解决方案，具有实践意义。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有动态面部表情识别方法中因多源数据和个体差异导致的表现下降。

Method: 设计了HDF框架，其中包括两个模块：时间-频率分布注意模块（DAM）提升一致性和风格鲁棒性，分布感知缩放模块（DSM）动态平衡分类与对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上，该方法显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HDF框架在不同场景中表现出色，展示了其强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised

further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Motivation: 为了应对Algonauts 2025挑战，开发高效的全脑fMRI响应预测模型，探索视觉、听觉和语言输入与大脑活动的关联。

Method: 使用VideoMAE、HuBERT、Qwen和BridgeTower等预训练模型提取刺激特征，通过自动回归的方式结合双重交叉注意机制，建模多模态上下文的时空结构。同时采用共享编码器和部分个体化解码器，平衡跨主体通用性和个体差异。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如MC Dropout往往只关注模型或数据不确定性，难以有效实现分布外样本的语义检测。作者希望通过一种新的方法全面估计分布不确定性并处理歧义或未知区域。

Method: 引入基于自由能量的Beta分布密度估计器以及嵌入后验网络的损失函数，实现无需随机采样的直接不确定性估计，并结合RPL框架识别OoD区域。

Result: 方法在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly和Segment-Me-If-You-Can等实际基准上验证了其有效性，显著提升了不确定性感知分割的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提高了语义解释能力，还兼具计算效率，为OoD识别和不确定性估计提供了先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: 通过双向扩散建模和创新模块，所提出的方法显著提高了低光图像增强的质量，并对多种退化场景具有有效适应性。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Result: 实验表明，WaveMamba在四个基准数据集上的平均mAP提升了4.5%，超过了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过综合频率特征融合和改进检测机制，显著提高了目标检测精度，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督域自适应（UDA）方法，用于解决3D LiDAR语义分割中因领域迁移导致的性能下降问题，且无需目标域标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的3D LiDAR语义分割面临性能因领域迁移（如传感器类型、地理位置）而下降的问题，而手动标注目标数据代价极高。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段框架：阶段一，通过无监督对比学习在分段级别预训练骨干网络，学习域不变特征；阶段二，利用包括投影、体素、混合及圆柱等多种方法的多模型伪标注策略，通过硬投票生成具有高质量的目标域伪标签，然后用这些伪标签对预训练网络进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，从SemanticKITTI领域适配到未标注数据集（SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic）时，与直接迁移和单模型UDA方法相比，分割精度显著提高。

Conclusion: 结合对比预训练和精炼的集成伪标注是有效解决领域间复杂差异且无需目标域标注的关键方法。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba通过结合UNet框架与mamba机制以及引入噪声消减模块（NRM），在低数据量的医学图像分割中实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习在数据不足的情况下容易过拟合噪声和无关模式，导致泛化能力受限，特别是在医学图像分割领域存在该问题。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，结合UNet框架与mamba机制，并在编码器中引入噪声消减模块（NRM），通过信号差分策略减少噪声和无关激活，增强对任务相关特征的表征能力。

Result: 在MSD（肺、胰腺）、AIIB23等公开数据集上，Diff-UMamba实现了1-3%的性能提升。在BraTS-21数据集进行小样本实验，并在内部NSCLC CBCT数据集上进行验证，显示出4-5%的改进。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在医学图像分割中表现出色，特别是在数据匮乏的情况下，其噪声抑制能力显著增强了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MatSSL，一种通过Gated Feature Fusion在每个主干阶段整合多级表示的精简自监督学习架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的金属材料显微图分析依赖于需要大量标注数据的监督学习方法，且在数据不足时表现不佳。而现有的许多自监督方法依赖于大规模数据，限制了其应用。

Method: MatSSL通过对小规模未标注数据集进行自监督预训练，然后在多个基准数据集上微调模型，使用Gated Feature Fusion提升多级特征融合能力。

Result: 在MetalDAM数据集上，MatSSL分割模型实现了69.13%的mIoU，超越了依赖ImageNet预训练模型的66.73%。此外，在EBC基准数据集上，mIoU的平均改进高达近40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL在仅使用少量未标注数据的情况下，能够在金相学领域实现有效的适应，同时保持从大规模自然图像预训练中获得的丰富且可迁移的特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CFG的文本到图像生成需要复杂的采样策略，并导致高昂的推理成本。

Method: 通过一种新型的蒸馏方法，将指导强度直接融入文本嵌入，并使用线性操作融合条件和无条件文本嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型通过简单高效的采样策略可接近教师模型的性能，推理速度提升至6倍，且图像质量与教师模型相近。

Conclusion: TeEFusion方法无需额外参数即可实现低成本、高效的文本到图像生成，为该领域提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Result: 实验结果显示，LEAF模型在多个疾病类型的数据集上改进了原扩散模型的表现。

Conclusion: 方法在提升模型性能的同时未改变架构，也未增加推理阶段的参数和计算量，从而保持了高效性。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

Motivation: 当前3D点云TTA方法计算开销高且可能需要额外训练数据，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出GSDTTA方法，使用图傅里叶变换(GFT)将点云转换至图谱域，优化频率分量的最低10%以进行适应，然后通过反GFT重构点云，并结合特征向导的自训练策略优化。

Conclusion: GSDTTA在3D点云分类领域展示了卓越的性能，证明了在图谱域进行测试时自适应的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 研究发现龋齿与肺癌存在因果关系，未发现牙周炎的因果关系，并建议整合牙齿护理和肺功能监测以预防癌症。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测研究表明牙病可能与肺癌相关，但因果关系不明确，因此需要通过基因学方法探讨其因果关系。

Method: 采用双样本孟德尔随机化方法分析龋齿和牙周炎与肺癌的因果关系，使用来自大规模基因组关联研究的数据进行分析，同时评估肺功能下降的中介作用。

Result: 结果显示龋齿与总肺癌及其亚型之间有显著的正因果关系，特别是在鳞癌中风险增加188.0%，部分因肺功能下降所介导；未发现牙周炎有因果效应。

Conclusion: 龋齿对肺癌风险有因果促进作用，需将牙病护理与肺功能监测整合进癌症预防策略中。

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多模态任务中表现出色，但在目标检测任务上的表现仍相较于专业检测器存在明显差距。

Method: 提出了LMM-Det，探索在大型多模态模型中进行目标检测，通过数据分布调整和推理优化提高召回率，并重新组织指令对话以提升检测能力。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了LMM-Det的有效性，证明无需额外检测模块的大型多模态模型也具备检测能力。

Conclusion: LMM-Det成功弥合了多模态模型和专业目标检测器之间的差距，为多模态模型在目标检测任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

Motivation: 尽管大规模视觉语言模型在图文理解任务上表现优越，但对科学领域复杂数据的解读仍是未被充分探索的领域。

Method: 框架包含领域感知语言生成策略和数据压缩多模态模型调优，提取物理特性并生成结构化描述；通过数据压缩策略优化模型对领域数据的解读能力。

Result: 在新的基准数据集上，FieldLVLM在科学领域数据相关任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法将大规模视觉语言模型成功应用于科学研究领域，有助于推动领域特定发现与大模型之间的连接。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Conclusion: 研究提供了第一个系统性基准测试和标准化评估框架，为推进半监督ECG波形分割方法研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Conclusion: MNN框架在统一局部信息与全局性质的情况下提供了强大的理论支持和实践应用，是一种灵活而高效的低秩恢复方法。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Motivation: 现有方法限制了体素的感受野，仅局限于影像的固定位置。本文旨在提升体素特征的表示能力和效率。

Method: 引入几何与上下文感知聚合模块，在自适应区域内整合几何和上下文信息，并动态调整多视角贡献，同时采用稀疏体素构建策略，选择高占用概率体素以优化特征。

Result: SGCDet在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在仅利用3D边框监督的情况下，显著提升了体素特征表示能力及构建效率，具有重要研究价值。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

Motivation: 现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中的表现较差，于是提出通过可视化鸟类歌声的节奏模式等信息提高分类效果。

Method: 通过在声谱图中加入主要颜色的频率信息，以增强种类之间的区分能力，并利用深度学习模型进行分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著优于未使用颜色化的模型，并超越BirdCLEF 2024获胜模型，F1值提升7.3%，ROC-AUC提升6.2%，CMAP提升6.6%。

Conclusion: 将频率信息通过颜色化嵌入声谱图能够有效改善鸟类种类分类，展示了该技术提高模型性能的潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various

Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为SynC的新框架，旨在为零样本图像描述任务 (ZIC) 精炼合成图像-文本数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的文本生成图像模型(T2I)生成的图像常存在与其文本描述语义不匹配的问题，导致用这些数据训练的模型表现欠佳，而现有数据筛选方法不能有效处理这种问题。

Method: SynC框架通过重新为语义对齐的图像分配相应的描述，而不是简单地过滤或再生成数据。使用一种多对一的映射策略和循环一致性得分的方法，选出与描述最匹配的图像。

Result: 在多个标准基准(MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps)上验证，SynC显著提升了多种ZIC模型的性能，并在多项场景下达到了当前最优结果。

Conclusion: SynC为零样本图像描述任务的合成数据集优化提供了一种高效策略，可以显著提高模型的表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于物理渲染的人体逆渲染方法，采用高品质的数据集（OpenHumanBRDF）和渐进式训练策略，提升了材质估计性能并实现了更逼真的渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人体逆渲染任务中材质估计的难题，特别是提高皮肤渲染的真实性，这对于在任意光照条件下实现真实感渲染至关重要。

Method: 构建高质量的OpenHumanBRDF数据集，新增位移和次表面散射材质信息。同时，设计了HumanMaterial模型，采用渐进式训练策略和Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR)损失函数，通过三阶段模型估计和细化方式优化材质估计。

Result: 通过在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和实际数据上进行大量实验，该方法在材质估计和渲染真实感方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新方法有效解决了人体逆渲染的不适定问题，显著提升了材质估计的准确性和渲染效果的真实性，为领域发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

*Simin Huo,Ning Li*

TL;DR: Iwin Transformer是一种无需位置嵌入的新型分层视觉Transformer，结合了交错窗口注意力和深度可分离卷积，实现了从低到高分辨率的直接微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Swin Transformer需要连续两个模块才能近似全局注意力的局限性，同时提升视觉任务中的性能。

Method: 通过交错窗口注意力和深度可分离卷积融合，实现单个模块中全局信息的交换，打破传统的限制。

Result: 在视觉基准测试中表现出强竞争力，如ImageNet-1K图像分类(87.4 top-1准确率)、语义分割和视频动作识别。此外，核心模块还在条件图像生成中验证了其独立的有效性。

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer有效拓展了视觉Transformer的应用范围，具有启发未来研究的潜力，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DCFFSNet网络，通过特征分离融合战略改善医疗图像分割中的连通性和边缘一致性问题，相较于现有方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度网络在医疗图像中引入连通性时，强行将其作为附加模块注入，导致特征空间耦合，缺乏标准化机制来量化不同特征强度。

Method: 提出一种创新的特征空间解耦策略，结合双连通性特征融合-分离网络，动态平衡多尺度特征表达，实现特征的量化和有效分离。

Result: 实验结果表明，DCFFSNet在ISIC2018、DSB2018和MoNuSeg数据集上的Dice和IoU等指标均超过现有主流方法。例如，在ISIC2018上，Dice提升1.3%，IoU提升1.2%。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet实现了分割断裂问题的有效解决，并实现平滑的边缘过渡，显著提升了临床可用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了一种结合自监督学习（SSL）方法和V-JEPA框架的超声波视频数据分割方法，并通过引入新的3D辅助任务改善了模型的局限性，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决超声影像数据难获取且标注复杂的挑战，利用SSL方法在有限标注数据条件下提高分割性能，同时探索适合超声数据特性的框架。

Method: 采用了V-JEPA框架，通过特征预测避免了对像素级重构的依赖，并引入了一个全新的3D定位辅助任务来增强视觉变换器（ViT）的局部表示能力。

Result: 引入3D辅助任务后，使用V-JEPA的分割性能显著提升，使用100%数据时性能提高3.4%，使用10%数据时提高了8.35%。

Conclusion: 本文首次在超声波视频数据中应用V-JEPA框架，并通过设计3D辅助任务改善了SSL模型的局限性，有效提升了分割效果，展示了优秀的应用潜力。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Conclusion: 该方法通过DSFormer和块聚类策略实现了对环境变化鲁棒的全球嵌入，显著提升了视觉地点识别性能，同时降低了数据和计算资源的消耗。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Result: 通过微调MLLMs，可提升其零样本问答任务性能高达73.2%；在Brain4Cars和AIDE数据集上的任务表现分别提升了最多12.5%和11.0%。

Conclusion: PDB-Eval框架成功缩小了MLLMs与驾驶领域之间的鸿沟，显著增强了其驾驶行为分析和任务性能，为个性化驾驶安全系统提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Conclusion: 该框架能够加速研究进展，并提高对抗鲁棒性理解，为LiDAR感知中物理对抗性攻击研究提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Motivation: 现有防御机制如对抗训练和净化策略缺乏动态适应性，难以应对复杂3D场景中不断演化的对抗攻击。

Method: 提出Rein-EAD框架，通过主动探索和环境交互，结合多步目标优化和不确定性奖励机制，以提升模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD不仅适用于如3D物体分类、人脸识别、自动驾驶等复杂的实际任务，还展现出对多变对抗情境的强大适应性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 研究目的是提高机器在目标导向视觉任务中对人类注意力预测的能力，利用语义和人工中心视觉机制，模仿人类扫描路径。

Method: 模型名为SemBA-FAST，结合深度目标检测和概率语义融合机制，动态生成注意力图，并通过人工中心视觉更新知识和逐步改进注视预测。

Conclusion: SemBA-FAST通过语义-中心视觉框架展现了优越的人类注意力建模能力，为认知计算和机器人领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于跨稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征定量比较的指标，并在视觉、文本和多模态编码器上进行研究，结果表明不同类型的编码器之间共享某些特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经网络特征中提取人类可解释性特征是一个重要课题。现有的工作通常只比较同一模态下的模型，而没有跨模态进行定量比较。

Method: 提出了两个新工具：一种跨模态定量比较模型的新指标，和一种衡量不同模型类别之间共享特征程度的方法。并对21个编码器进行了多个实验，涵盖视觉、文本和多模态类型。

Result: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLM）的特定特征与文本编码器共享，这表明文本预训练的显著影响。还量化了编码器之间共享表示的程度。

Conclusion: 新方法为跨模态比较模型提供了一种有效工具，实验结果刷新了对编码器共享性和特定性的新理解。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

Motivation: 3D语义占用预测对于自动驾驶至关重要，其目的是在复杂环境中实现精确与安全的解读与导航。为了获得可靠的预测，需进行传感器数据的有效融合。

Method: 提出了GaussianFusionOcc方法，其利用3D语义高斯表征，并结合创新的传感器融合机制，通过从摄像头、LiDAR和雷达传感器中提取重要信息，然后修正高斯属性，以获得更高效的环境表征。

Result: 实验表明，不同传感器组合下的测试结果验证了该方法的灵活性，且GaussianFusionOcc的性能优于当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过多模态融合的鲁棒性和高斯表征的高效性，GaussianFusionOcc提高了3D语义占用预测的性能，且具备更高的内存效率和推断速度。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 当前LVLM虽具有强大的指令执行能力和视觉理解能力，但在时间序列中实现细粒度的空间控制存在显著的困难。

Method: 建议了提示组合策略以建模用户意图与视频序列的隐含关系，并设计参数高效的框适配器，增强视觉上下文中的对象语义信息，使视觉标记具有用户意图的先验知识。

Conclusion: 结合提示设计与框适配器策略，可增强LVLM对视频时间序列的空间细节建模能力，从而更准确地生成以意图为导向的控制字幕。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Conclusion: EDA扩展了扩散模型的设计空间，有效解决了现有模型的局限性，并在多种复杂的图像恢复任务中实现了先进性能。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Conclusion: 结合预训练多视点立体先验和新的概率对齐策略，框架有效应对未标定重建中大规模多视点数据的挑战，为 3DGS 技术提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV

and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于深度学习的年龄和性别分类方法，利用定制的CNN架构进行联合建模，表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个能够同时进行年龄和性别分类的模型，以提升广告投放的精准性。

Method: 使用共享表示的定制卷积神经网络（CNN）架构，依赖一个多样化的人脸图像数据集进行训练并进行增强处理以解决光照、姿势和图像质量的变化问题。

Result: 性别分类的准确率达到95%，年龄估算平均绝对误差为5.77岁，并分析了不同年龄段的表现和偏差。

Conclusion: 联合学习的模式显著提升了性能，同时也揭示了某些特定年龄段的建模挑战，需要进一步研究和优化。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: 研究介绍了一种名为Scenethesis的方法，用于从自然语言需求生成三维交互界面软件，解决了现有方法难以处理复杂约束问题的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的2D界面生成技术已经相对成熟，而3D软件生成由于其复杂的空间和语义约束仍处于探索阶段，因此作者试图提出一种方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Scenethesis，一种基于特定领域语言ScenethesisLang的方法。通过将软件生成分解成多个阶段处理用户需求，精细化控制和验证3D软件组件，并以满足复杂的空间约束为目标。

Result: 评估结果显示，Scenethesis可以准确满足超过80%的用户需求，同时满足90%以上的硬性约束，在复杂约束场景中表现出色；并在视觉评估中优于现有技术42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis通过提出一个具有约束表达能力的中间表达语言，实现了自然语言需求到可执行三维软件生成的全流程优化，为未来的3D软件智能生成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对未见过的变形技术和面部风格的新型去伪变形方法，显著提升去伪变形效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去伪变形技术存在伪变形复制问题，或对训练和测试需要采用相同的变形技术，亟需一种新方法解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出一种在潜在空间中分解伪变形的方法，能够去伪变形由未见过的变形技术和面孔风格生成的图像。

Result: 该方法在用合成面孔训练后，在实际面孔上测试表现优异，效果远超现有方法，且生成的去伪变形面孔图像质量较高。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅克服了伪变形复制问题，还能够很好地处理各种未知的变形技术，显著提升了去伪变形领域的表现。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零样本领域适应方法SIDA，通过生成和利用合成图像风格特征实现高效适应目标域，展现了出色的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的零样本领域适应方法难以捕捉复杂的现实变化且增加时间消耗，因此探索基于图像数据的方法。

Method: 利用合成图像进行适应，生成源样式图片后进行样式转换，设计Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块以增强域内表示和样式分配能力。

Result: 在多种零样本适应场景中表现出色，特别是在挑战性域中，同时显著降低适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA方法通过合成图像有效解决了零样本领域适应的困难，提供了一种高效且优质的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM)的新方法来优化现有的DMD（分布匹配蒸馏）框架，改善其模式崩塌问题，并且提升一/多步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DMD方法因依赖于反向KL散度，而可能导致部分情况下的模式崩塌问题，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来实现分布对齐。

Method: 提出了ADM框架，利用基于扩散模型的判别器，在真实和生成的分数估计器之间以对抗的方式实现潜在分布对齐；并结合混合判别器以及分布式损失提升预训练生成器的性能。

Result: 提出的DMDX框架，通过结合对抗蒸馏预训练与ADM微调，在高质量和高效的图像、视频合成任务中表现优异，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合改进的预训练和ADM微调，DMDX框架在更高效的一步和多步生成的同时大幅减少GPU时间，为高效图像和视频合成树立了新的标杆。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为HybridTM的混合架构，将Transformer和Mamba结合用于3D语义分割，既能捕获长距离依赖关系，又能提取细粒度局部特征，并且在多个基准数据集上实现了最新的技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在3D语义分割中表现卓越，但其二次复杂度限制了其处理大规模点云长距离依赖关系的能力，而Mamba虽然效率高，但在特征表达能力上有不足，需要开发一种方法结合二者优点。

Method: 提出了HybridTM架构，通过内层混合策略在细粒度层面整合Attention机制和Mamba方法，同时实现长距依赖和局部特征提取的平衡。

Result: 实验证明了HybridTM在各种室内外数据集上的有效性和泛化能力，并在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes基准测试上达到了最新的技术水平。

Conclusion: HybridTM通过创新地整合Transformer和Mamba的优势，在3D语义分割领域提供了性能和效率并重的解决方案，对未来相关研究有重要参考价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Motivation: 针对通过指明艺术家风格生成图像的争议性使用场景，开发一种工具可以识别图像是通过哪些艺术家风格组合生成。

Method: 创建了一个包含195万图像、涉及110位艺术家的数据集并提供四种泛化设置。通过对多种方法评估，包括特征相似性基线、对比风格描述、监督分类器等，分析了哪种技术表现最好。

Result: 监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示下表现优异，而风格描述方法在强调风格的图像中效果较好，但多艺术家提示仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该基准测试显示了现有技术的改进空间，并为推进文本到图像生成的责任管理提供了公共测试平台。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Motivation: 为解决短片生成中视觉及情节长距离连贯性问题以及提高效率和质量而提出。

Method: 方法包括两个步骤：1）通过关键帧规划保证情节及视觉的长距离连贯性；2）基于训练的定义模型进行视频动态合成，并采用专用的跨模态扩散变换器（MM-DiT）和交错训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在生成视觉效果和叙述上均表现出高水平的连贯性和效率。

Conclusion: Captain Cinema开创了高质量、多场景连续短片的生成方法，展示出生成电影级短片的潜力。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有研究通过LLM生成的推理增强了推理能力，并改善了动作预测的效果，但其性能仍受制于用于生成推理的模型的能力。

Method: 设计了一种名为Shop-R1的强化学习框架，将模拟任务分解为推理生成和动作预测两阶段，分别通过自监督与分层奖励机制改进其表现。

Result: 实验显示，相较于基线方法，提高了超过65%的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的Shop-R1框架能够显著提升LLMs在特定任务中的推理和行为模拟能力，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

Method: 提出使用奖励树构建多维度的奖励标准，并利用动态选择信号进行逐步奖励评分，同时创新性地采用帕累托支配估计来识别区分性正负对。

Result: 实验表明，DG-PRM在主流基准上表现卓越，显著提升模型在密集奖励任务中的性能。

Conclusion: DG-PRM不仅在实验任务中表现突出，还表现出对分布外场景的卓越适应性，泛化能力优秀。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting

key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the

Motivation: 为了解决当前系统在需要转录、多模型处理以及计算资源消耗大的问题，提出一种简化架构来评估多部分口语考试分数。

Method: 采用单一Whisper-small编码器处理多部分口语回答，通过轻量化结合层聚合信息，直接预测最终分数，避免使用转录和逐部分模型，还提出了数据采样策略应对类别不平衡。

Result: 在RMSE上取得0.384的优异表现，相较基线的0.44有显著提升，且使用的参数不超过168M。此外，在减少训练数据至44.8%的情况下，仍能达到0.383 RMSE，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了自动口语评估流程，提升了精度和训练效率，实现大规模语言学习系统应用的可行性。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing

Motivation: 探讨新兴LLM（DeepSeek）生成的文本是否能被现有AI检测工具准确检测，弥补相关研究的空白，评估对抗攻击的影响。

Method: 收集49个人类写作样本与DeepSeek生成的匹配样本，共计245份数据，加入标准与人性化的改写，对六种检测工具（如Copyleaks、GPTZero等）测试并评估性能，同时采用少样本提示与链式推理法评估DeepSeek检测能力。

Conclusion: 某些检测工具在未经攻击的文本上表现良好，但人性化改写极大影响了准确性。DeepSeek通过少样本和链式推理展示了极高的检测能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了更大和更强的语言模型是否在处理上下文中证据时更符合贝叶斯定理，提出了贝叶斯一致系数（BCC）指标来测试这一点，并提供了验证数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在处理上下文的证据时是否能够更好地更新“信念”，理解模型的一致性和准确性。

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致系数（BCC）指标，生成数据集进行测量，并分析不同大小、参数数量和训练数据规模的语言模型在这一指标上的表现。

Result: 测试表明更大、更强的语言模型在与贝叶斯定理的一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结果有助于了解和优化大语言模型的行为和管理策略。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce the latest series of TeleChat models: \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5}, and \textbf{T1}, offering a significant upgrade over
their predecessor, TeleChat. Despite minimal changes to the model architecture,
the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training

reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出NeuralDB，一个用于在大规模语言模型中进行高效知识编辑的新框架，对于常规任务性能没有明显影响，还可扩展至编辑10万条事实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前Locate-and-Edit在知识编辑时可能导致通用能力削弱的问题，同时提高大规模、多事实编辑的效率。

Method: 将编辑过程建模为查询Key-Value数据库，并引入非线性门控检索模块，仅在涉及编辑事实时运行，从而保护语言模型的通用能力。

Result: 在ZsRE和CounterFacts数据集上对10,000条事实进行编辑实验，相比其他方法，NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性、流利性等方面表现更优，并保持语言模型在六项任务上的性能，还支持扩展至10万条事实的编辑。

Conclusion: NeuralDB能有效解决大规模事实编辑中的相关问题，在保证LLM性能的同时，实现了更高扩展性和编辑效率。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GrAInS，一个无需修改模型权重，仅通过推理时调整内部激活来控制LLMs和VLMs行为的方法，并在多项任务中有效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时行为调整方法存在三大问题：依赖固定干预向量、忽视输入token的因果影响以及未充分利用模型的梯度信息，特别是在多模态设置中。

Method: GrAInS通过Integrated Gradients确定最具影响力的前k个token，并利用这些token构造方向性调整向量，在推理时通过Transformer层的激活调整来进行行为引导，同时保持表示尺度的一致性。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、MMHal-Bench和SPA-VL任务中，GrAInS显著提高了准确性、降低了幻觉率并改善了对齐能力。

Conclusion: GrAInS能实现精细、可解释且模块化的模型行为控制，无需重新训练并表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音断句预测方法依赖人工标注，成本高且存在变异性，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用LLM生成合成断句标注数据，并与传统标注进行对比，评估多种语言情境下的效果。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据在解决语音断句预测中的数据问题上表现出色。

Conclusion: LLM可作为语音领域中的有效工具，减轻人工标注负担，同时提升数据一致性与质量。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Result: 实验结果显示，现有大语言模型在生成多样化及隐私保护的合成数据方面存在明显局限。通过改进的提示方法，多样性和隐私均得到部分改善。

Conclusion: 基于本文方法可提升合成数据的质量，为实际数据驱动应用提供更安全、可靠的选择。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注SLMs是否能完成类似大型语言模型（LLMs）的复杂任务，未能真正反映现实对话场景中用户的自然交互需求。

Method: 设计了名为TELEVAL的动态基准框架，从明确语义、语音外特征及隐含语义和系统能力三个维度评估SLMs的对话能力，采用模仿真实使用场景的对话格式，并分别对文字和音频输出进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，尽管SLMs已有进展，但其在自然对话任务中仍有巨大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL可作为以用户为中心的评估框架，更直接反映用户体验，推动更强大的对话导向SLMs的发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型微调中计算和内存需求高的问题，探索高效的PEFT技术。

Method: 提出一种动态混合方法，将BOFT的正交稳定性与LoRA-GA的梯度对齐快速收敛特性结合，利用基于梯度范数的逐层自适应更新。同时首次将uRNN的结构性单位约束应用于Transformer模型。

Result: 在四个基准（GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench、HumanEval）上进行评估，混合方法在训练时间减少至2.1倍、内存消耗减少50%的情况下，接近甚至超越全微调准确率。

Conclusion: 混合方法是一种在计算资源有限场景下实用且可扩展的大语言模型微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Motivation: 语言和世界不断发展，需要更新2014年原始GloVe模型以适应当前使用需求，同时提供更详细的文档记录原始数据版本和预处理方法。

Method: 基于维基百科、Gigaword和Dolma的一个子集创建两个词嵌入模型，并通过词汇比较、直接测试及命名实体识别（NER）任务进行评估。

Result: 新模型包含了最新的文化和语言词汇，结构性任务（如类比和相似性）表现相当，在非西方新闻数据集等近期任务中性能有所提高。

Conclusion: 2024年的GloVe模型提供了更新、更强的语言表示，展示了对新需求和数据集的改进。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Motivation: 现有的语言模型多忽略语音中的副语言信息和说话者特性，限制了与人类进行自然交互的能力。

Method: 设计了双模态结构，将语言建模与语音实现解耦，并提出模块化分阶段训练策略，使模型能利用大量语音-文本语料对语言与副语言信息进行对齐学习。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM证明了副语言信息的重要性，为更自然、适应性强和社会感知的语音交互系统开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型通过生成和编辑代码实现视觉操作以改进数学推理的方法及其表现。

Method: 设计了一种双重评估框架：多模态代码生成（MCG）和编辑（MCE），并建立一个包含五种数学图形类型的数据集进行测评。

Result: 实验测试九种现有大语言模型，结果表明其在细粒度视觉操作上仍远远落后于人类水平。

Conclusion: 目前多模态大语言模型在数学推理中的代码操作能力仍需显著改进。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在复杂、具有挑战性的HIV管理中的潜力，同时识别其局限性并为临床应用提供建议。

Method: 创建了HIVMedQA基准数据集，包含临床相关问题，并结合不同模型及提示工程，设计框架从多维度评估模型性能，包括问题理解、推理、知识召回等。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，两款表现前三的模型是专有的；医学微调的模型并不总优于通用模型，且推理和理解较记忆更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究证明LLMs在HIV管理中的潜力，但需要有针对性的开发和评估以确保安全有效地整合到临床护理中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）在多选任务中可能利用选项位置或标签的偏差获得高分，而非真正理解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决LLMs在多选任务中可能存在的选择偏差问题，提出一种通用的评估框架。

Method: 引入了SCOPE评估框架，通过无语义内容的空提示反复测试，估计模型的偏好分布，然后根据逆向偏差分布重新分配答案位置，并防止错误选项与正确答案位置相邻。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE比现有的消偏方法表现更佳，提升性能稳定性并显示出更清晰的正确选项置信分布。

Conclusion: SCOPE框架为提高LLM评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

Motivation: 检索增强生成模型依赖外部知识，可能被攻击者注入有害文档，导致生成误导性输出，亟需防护方法。

Method: GMTP通过分析检索器相似性函数的梯度识别关键影响词，并使用遮掩语言模型检测这些词的概率是否异常低，从而筛选恶意文档。

Result: 实验证明GMTP能够有效检测并消除90%以上的恶意内容，同时保留相关文档，保持模型的高效生成与检索性能。

Conclusion: GMTP提供了一种高效、高精度的方法来防范知识库中的恶意文档，有助于增强检索增强生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了指令微调对大型语言模型(LLMs)错误信息易感性的影响，发现指令微调增加了用户输入对模型输出的影响，使模型更容易接受用户提供的错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索指令微调是否会增加LLMs对用户输入中错误信息的敏感性，并分析其可能带来的负面影响。

Method: 通过对比指令微调模型与基础模型的表现，分析不同提示结构、错误信息长度以及系统提示中警告的存在对模型错误信息易感性的影响。

Result: 指令微调模型显著更易接受用户提供的错误信息，相比未微调模型对用户输入信息更加依赖。

Conclusion: 研究强调了指令微调可能带来的负面影响，并呼吁采取系统化方法以缓解这些问题，从而提升LLMs在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的层剪枝方法Prune&Comp，通过补偿权重大小差距，减轻剪枝对大语言模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别到直接移除模型层会造成隐藏状态的显著大小差距，导致性能急剧下降，因而需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Prune&Comp方法，估算因移除模型层导致的大小差距，并通过离线重新缩放剩余权重来补偿这些差距，同时采用迭代剪枝策略来进一步优化剪枝效果。

Result: Prune&Comp能够显著改善原有层剪枝指标。在剪掉LLaMA-3-8B的5层时，与基线方法相比，困惑度减半并保留了93.19%的问答性能，性能提升4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp是一个有效的、无需额外训练的剪枝方案，能够提升大语言模型的剪枝性能，具有良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效定位语音中的术语并提高术语翻译成功率，同时保持通用翻译性能的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功应对了术语翻译的主要挑战，为直接语音翻译的术语翻译提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管高资源语言的OCR问题已经基本解决，但针对使用独特脚本的低资源语言OCR问题仍然是一个开放性问题，需要进一步研究，以推动该领域的发展。

Method: 对六种OCR引擎（包括商业和开源系统）进行了零样本性能比较，使用五种测量技术从字符和词级别评估精度，同时引入了一个人造Tamil OCR基准数据集。

Result: Surya在Sinhala语言上的WER为2.61%，表现最佳；Document AI在Tamil上的CER为0.78%，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 针对不同低资源语言，OCR系统性能存在显著差异，研究提供了高效且可比较的评估方式，为进一步优化低资源语言的OCR方法提供了基础。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Motivation: 为了使大型语言模型（LLMs）能够适应特定的风格特性（如品牌声音或作者语调），而不牺牲指令遵循能力。

Method: 通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)框架，先在基础模型上训练风格适配器，然后与单独的指令遵循模型结合，完成风格特性迁移。

Result: 实验表明，StyleAdaptedLM能够在多种数据集和模型中提升风格一致性，同时保持良好的指令遵循。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs提供了一种高效的风格个性化实现方式，可在不依赖配对数据的情况下达到品牌特定的语调调整。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的“过度思考后门”是一个纯资源消耗型攻击，可精确控制推理模型的思考过程，为安全研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器翻译中模糊性别时模型展现偏见行为的现象，同时通过引入不确定性度量来改进模型的性别处理能力。

Method: 通过使用近期提出的语义不确定性度量，评估模型在含性别歧义和非歧义情况下的翻译准确性和不确定性表现，同时研究去偏方法涵盖的效果。

Result: 研究发现即使模型在性别明确的句子中表现较好，其在性别不明确时的语义不确定性并不总是符合预期。此外，去偏方法对含歧义和不含歧义的翻译实例各自产生独立影响。

Conclusion: 论文揭示当前机器翻译模型在性别模糊处理上的局限性，建议引入适当的不确定性处理以减少偏见，并且提示了去偏方法需要针对语境灵活调整。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Method: 提出TDR框架，通过任务解耦确保检索模块针对目标任务检索示例，同时将LLM细粒度反馈用于监督检索模块的训练，提升检索效果，并通过多任务数据集实验验证。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR在所有数据集上均实现了结果提升，并达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: TDR证明了其在ICL示例检索能力上的显著提升，提供了一种可即插即用的有效方案，可与多种LLM结合以改进ICL性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Method: 引入CLEAR工具包，它通过生成逐实例的文本反馈，识别并量化系统级错误问题，提供交互式仪表盘进行综合错误分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和Math基准上展示了其分析能力，并通过用户案例研究验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR为LLM的错误分析提供了清晰直观的方法，有助于深入了解模型的行为模式和改进方向。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

### [127] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable是一种新的综合基准，用于评估大语言模型(LLMs)在处理阿拉伯语表格数据时的推理和理解能力，同时提供了一套自动化评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流的LLMs在处理英语表格数据上有一定成果，但对阿拉伯语表格数据的研究资源稀缺且性能有限。因此需要一个专门的基准来评估和提升LLMs在阿拉伯语结构化数据上的能力。

Method: 提出AraTable基准，包括直接问答、事实验证和复杂推理三类评估任务。通过LLMs生成初始内容并由人工审核以确保数据质量。此外，设计了一种基于自我推理的全自动化评估框架。

Result: 初步实验表明，LLMs在简单的表格任务（如直接问答）上表现良好，但在深度推理和事实验证等任务上仍存在显著困难。自动化评估框架的表现接近人工判定水平。

Conclusion: AraTable推进了阿拉伯语表格数据处理研究，填补了公开资源的空白，并为提升LLMs在复杂推理上的性能提供了方向和工具。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床NLP中的稀疏性及隐私问题。

Method: 在多个文献数据库中搜索相关文献，并从1398篇文献中筛选出94篇相关内容；分析其生成目的、技术和评价方法。

Result: 生成合成医学文本的主要目的是文本增强、辅助写作、语料库构建、隐私保护、注释及实用性。GPT等Transformer技术主导生成技术，评价方法主要包括相似性、隐私性、结构性和实用性，其中实用性评价最为常用。

Conclusion: 生成的合成医学文本作为增强或补充材料，可改善下游任务性能及缓解数据稀疏问题，但隐私问题仍需关注。生成技术的进步将加速工作流程和管道的开发。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GraDe，一种在LLMs注意力机制中引入稀疏依赖图的方法，以解决表格数据中稀疏特征依赖问题，显著提升了复杂数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在表格数据生成上受关注稀释问题困扰，缺乏对稀疏特征依赖的聚焦处理机制。研究的动机是提升LLMs在复杂依赖数据上的性能。

Method: 引入GraDe方法，通过轻量级动态图学习模块，结合外部提取的功能依赖，将稀疏依赖图融入LLMs的注意力机制，以优先处理关键特征交互并抑制无关交互。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多个真实世界数据集上，GraDe在复杂数据集上的性能比现有LLM方法提升了最多12%，并在合成数据质量上与现有最优方法表现相当。

Conclusion: GraDe是一种结构感知的表格数据建模方法，具有低侵入性和高效性，为基于LLMs的表格数据建模提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

datasets using ROC, PR, and DET curve analysis.
  Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false
negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt
engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning
remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.

a novel approach designed to handle nested named entities while integrating

mitigates annotation gaps by dynamically adjusting loss computation to avoid

extensive experiments, including a cross-corpus evaluation and human assessment

biomedical and general-domain NER tasks, while improving cross-domain

Result: 在Multi30K和WMT数据集上展示了显著的性能提升，尤其在无图像情况下仍能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GIIFT方法有效缓解模态差异问题，并在广泛的领域中实现了无图像下的高性能翻译。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合6-mer标记化与BPE-600的混合标记化策略，显著提升DNA语言模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的k-mer标记化虽然对局部DNA序列结构有效，但存在分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题，研究旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 通过将唯一的6-mer标记与经过600次循环生成的BPE标记合并，建立平衡且具有上下文感知的词汇表，并在此基础上训练DNA语言模型。

Result: 模型在next-k-mer预测任务中表现出色，3-mer、4-mer和5-mer的预测准确率分别为10.78%、10.1%和4.12%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 混合标记化策略能够在DNA建模中同时保留局部序列结构和全局上下文信息，为下游DNA序列分析和生物学研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的解码算法WINO，用于改进扩散大型语言模型(DLLMs)在质量和速度上的权衡问题。WINO显著提升了生成速度，同时提高了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散大型语言模型在快速并行生成时存在质量下降问题，主要由于标准解码方法不可逆且早期错误会逐渐积累并影响后续生成。

Method: WINO是一种无需训练的解码算法，结合“广输入、窄输出”的机制，通过并行起草生成多个标记，并使用双向上下文验证并重新掩盖可能存在问题的标记进行改进。

Result: 在多个开源扩散LLMs中，WINO显著改善了质量与速度的权衡。例如，在GSM8K数学基准上，推理速度提升了6倍，准确率提高了2.58%；在Flickr30K描述任务中，速度加快10倍且性能更高。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，WINO能够有效解决DLLMs存在的解码问题，展现出优越性能并对其操作机制提供深入理解。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Conclusion: AQuilt证明了在降低成本的同时能显著提高特定领域模型性能，并增强数据的下游任务适应性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提示优化中分为基于文本反馈的无训练方法和依赖数值奖励训练的专门提示模型两大方向。

Method: 介绍了一个名为TRPrompt的框架，将文本反馈直接融入提示模型训练，并通过生成提示的反馈迭代优化，而无需事先收集数据集。

Conclusion: 统一了现有基方法和模型训练方法，通过直接融入文本反馈，TRPrompt证明了其在提示优化领域的卓越效果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的强化学习方法“从清单反馈中进行强化学习”（RLCF），通过提取指令中的清单并评估其完成情况来计算奖励，从而改进语言模型对指令的理解和执行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法通常使用固定的评估标准（如“有用性”和“有害性”），而无法灵活适应特定指令的需求，因此提出一种新的、更灵活的方式来实现指令的更好支持。

Method: 通过分析指令中的清单项，并结合AI评审和专用验证程序的得分，为强化学习提供奖励信号，使模型更好地满足指令中的多样化需求。

Result: RLCF 方法在五个广泛研究的基准测试中均表现优异，包括在 FollowBench 上提升了 4 个点，在 InFoBench 上提升 6 个点，并在 Arena-Hard 上提升了 3 个点。

Conclusion: 清单反馈方法被证明是一种改善语言模型对多样化指令支持的重要工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了符号回归如何生成流体力学中的简洁数学模型，以及结合ASP框架提升模型物理可信度的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体力学不仅需要准确预测，还需要理解流动物理特性。符号回归为理解复杂物理系统提供了一种透明的数学工具。

Method: 采用PySR库从数值模拟数据中提取简洁数学表达式，并将符号回归与ASP知识表示框架相结合，确保物理可行性和领域一致性。

Result: 推导出的方程准确地近似了未压缩流体在矩形通道中的速度剖面和压降，并与文献中的解析解完全吻合。

Conclusion: 符号回归能够简化复杂流动行为为可解释的方程，而与ASP结合的混合框架提高了领域一致性，为实时数据分析和可解释预测的框架设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为I2I-STRADA的代理架构，用于改进数据分析中的推理过程，强调结构化认知工作流的重要性，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据分析代理系统在多任务管理方面表现优异，但缺乏对分析性思维中推理过程的结构化建模，导致分析质量不一致。

Method: 提出了I2I-STRADA，一种注重将分析推理过程划分为模块化子任务的代理架构，以实现系统化的认知推理步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I-STRADA在规划一致性和洞察对齐性方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流在数据分析代理设计中至关重要，I2I-STRADA展现了通过模块化推理提升数据分析效果的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Method: 设计并开发了SmartAPS，这是一种结合LLM和自然语言对话界面的工具，能直观地实现信息查询、反事实推理、推荐以及场景分析。

Result: SmartAPS使运营规划师能够更有效地管理操作，并通过自然语言交互实现了传统 APS 无法实现的友好用户体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的定性基于时间线规划方法需通过非确定性自动机以及复杂的确定化阶段来实现策略合成，耗费昂贵的计算成本。

Method: 本文提出通过直接映射至确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，避免非确定性自动机的确定化。

Result: 找出了定性时间线规划中可以应用确定性方法的一个片段，并确定了最大的一组适用于该片段的Allen's关系。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种更高效的规划策略合成方法，提高了基于时间线规划的实际可行性。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出E.A.R.T.H框架，将模型生成的错误转化为创新资产，并使用认知科学和生成建模来验证“创造潜力隐藏在失败中”的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何推动AI从模仿走向真正的创造力，用错误中心和反馈驱动的方法提升AI创造潜力。

Method: 通过五阶段生成流程：错误生成（Error generation）、放大（Amplification）、精炼选择（Refine selection）、变换（Transform）以及反馈利用（Harness feedback），并使用高级模型和工具如LLaMA-2等进行实现。

Result: 创意评分在精炼阶段提升了52.5%，最终提升至70.4%。生成标语显示更短、更有创意且保持高相关性。跨模测试中，标语与图像对齐强。人类评价中，隐喻标语比文字直白式更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 用错误为中心的反馈驱动生成能显著增强AI创造力，为构建自我进化、对齐人的创造性AI提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索图表是否能帮助AI系统更好地分析和理解数据。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5模型，在三种分析任务中比较它们在原始数据与散点图结合时的描述能力，并与两种基准（空白图表与错误匹配图表）进行对比。

Result: 研究发现，AI对数据集的描述在提供散点图后更加精确，尤其在数据集复杂性增加时显著提升。改进源于图表内容本身。

Conclusion: 初步证据表明，AI系统与人类一样，可以从数据可视化中获益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中训练或缺乏理论保证，需要更有效的框架来解决多智能体部分可观测环境中的问题。

Method: 引入MAGPO框架，使用自回归联合策略实现协调探索，并将其与分布式策略对齐，确保在部分可观测情况下的可执行性；提供了单调政策改进的理论保证。

Result: 在43项任务和6个环境中表现优异，超过现有CTDE基准，甚至达到或超越完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO是一种实用且理论支撑的解决方案，提升了去中心化多智能体学习的效果。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ASI-Arch，一个人工超级智能用于AI研究的系统，其通过自动化创新突破了人类认知能力对AI发展的限制，能够独立完成神经架构的发现与优化，最终生成了多个创新性架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能技术的快速进步，AI发展的速度受限于人类认知能力，作者希望突破这一限制，设想能让AI独立从事科学研究中的架构创新。

Method: 提出ASI-Arch系统，该系统基于完全自主的方法，通过假设、实现、训练和验证等步骤探索新的神经架构设计。与传统的NAS方法不同，ASI-Arch超越了人类定义的搜索空间，注重从优化转向创新。

Result: ASI-Arch系统进行了1,773次自动实验，消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，成功生成了106种创新的线性注意架构，这些架构在性能上优于现有的人类设计基准。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch展示了通过计算能力扩展科学发现的可能性，为自加速的AI系统提供了模板，并开启了架构创新的新阶段。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种Agentic AI框架，通过模块化、任务特定的代理系统，实现了医疗数据从处理到推理的自动化，显著降低了专家干预需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗机器学习中因预处理工作流程碎片化、模型兼容性问题及数据隐私限制导致的高成本和劳动密集型问题。

Method: 设计模块化的任务特定代理，包括数据识别代理、匿名化代理、特征提取代理、模型选择代理、预处理推荐与执行代理，以及模型推理代理，贯穿数据管道全流程。

Result: 通过测试老年病学、临终关怀和结肠镜成像的公开数据集，验证了框架的可行性和有效性，例如为焦虑数据和结肠镜息肉数据提供隐私合规的自动预处理和推理流程。

Conclusion: 提出的框架降低了专家介入的频率和成本，为医疗环境中的AI部署提供了可扩展且成本高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用自然语言处理技术和主动学习方法，从急诊科分流记录中快速检测潜在疫苗安全性问题的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于COVID-19疫苗快速开发带来的安全性数据收集窗口有限，亟需依赖疫后监测系统来确保接种安全性。

Method: 通过结合主动学习、数据增强与评估技术，开发分类器以从急诊科分流记录中提取疫苗安全相关信号。

Result: 展示了一种可以提高疫苗安全监测效率的方法，能够减少假阳性结果并加速模型实现。

Conclusion: 利用自然语言处理和主动学习技术，可以快速开发高效分类器，加强疫苗安全性的实时监测。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同聚合函数对图神经网络表达能力的影响，并与逻辑理论进行对比分析。

Method: 利用逻辑工具分析了平均聚合函数的GNN在非均匀和均匀设置下的表达能力，与最大值和求和等聚合模式进行了系统对比。

Result: 平均GNN在非均匀设置下比最大值GNN更强但不及求和GNN；在均匀设置下，其表现力低于其他两种GNN。

Conclusion: 平均聚合在GNN中有独特的表达能力，但在某些假设下低于最大值和求和。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 此研究提出一种认知归因框架，分析大语言模型（LLMs）中的知识与推理贡献及其分布特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中知识与推理的贡献及互动关系，为模型分析、可解释性和开发提供支持。

Method: 借鉴双系统认知理论，提出将LLMs中知识检索（快速思考）和推理调整（慢速思考）分为两个认知阶段的框架，并通过实验量化这两个部分的贡献。

Result: 在3个数据集上测试15个模型后发现：推理的调整对推理密集型领域（如数学、物理、化学）有益，但可能对知识密集型领域产生负面影响；参数扩展提升了知识和推理能力，且知识的提升更加明显；知识主要分布在网络的低层，推理则在更高层次。

Conclusion: 该框架解耦了知识与推理，为了解LLMs的结构及其局限性提供了全新视角，并对扩展法则、分层知识编辑等研究产生启发。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨不遵循模型最小化原则的答案集编程析取语义是否存在统一的视角。

Method: 分析并比较四种析取语义：Justified Models，Strongly Supported Models，Forks 和 DI 语义，通过证明这些方法的关系来探讨其统一性。

Result: 研究表明三种方法（Forks, Justified Models 和松弛版 DI 语义）在定义上等价，并且比 Strongly Supported Models 更强。

Conclusion: 三种方法形成了一种统一的语义，并且这些语义提供比稳定模型更强的解析能力，但 Strongly Supported Models 的处理类似于经典逻辑。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过概念框架分析AI部署与基本权利之间的相互作用，识别法律与权利冲突，同时为高风险AI系统及通用AI系统提供评估模型。

Method: 框架结合了定义平衡（通过比例分析解决权利冲突）和可辩驳推理（动态解决法律决策问题），分析AI场景对基本权利的多层次影响并构建逻辑基础。

Conclusion: 未来将通过形式化模型和有效算法开发进一步完善框架，将理论与实践结合，为负责任的AI治理提供支持。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical

### [155] [The AlphaPhysics Term Rewriting System for Marking Algebraic Expressions in Physics Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18337)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对物理考试题目自动评分的挑战，旨在开发一种高效且准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 本文综合使用计算机代数系统、SMT求解器及专为三角函数表达式设计的项重写系统，其中大语言模型用于标准化学生答案并将其转化为可机器解读的格式。

Result: 通过2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克超过1500份学生实际考试答卷的测试，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Motivation: 希望为金融领域提供一个既能评估创造性又能评估逻辑性的模型标准，以适应金融任务的不确定性和复杂性。

Method: 设计ConDiFi基准，包括607个宏观金融任务用于发散思维评估，以及990个多跳敌对选择题用于收敛思维评价，并测试14种主流模型。

Result: GPT-4o在新颖性和可操作性上表现较差，DeepSeek-R1和Cohere Command R+在生成可用于投资决策的可行见解方面排名靠前。

Conclusion: ConDiFi基准为LLMs在金融领域的安全和战略部署提供了新的评估框架。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则的推理优化框架（IBRO），用于改进大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，并通过轻量化方法验证了其在多个基准上的效果显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习策略在推理任务中的应用多为启发式，缺乏系统化方法。因此，本研究旨在从理论角度探讨更为原则性的优化框架，以改进LLM的推理性能。

Method: 引入基于信息瓶颈原则的IBRO框架，推导出实践性的符号级替代目标，并提出一种高效近似方法，以实现轻量化的IB正则化方法，同时支持与现有RL框架的无缝集成。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和强化学习算法上进行验证，结果显示IB正则化方法能持续提升LLM的推理表现。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为改进LLM推理能力提供了理论依据与实用工具，不仅提升了模型性能，还具有轻量化与易用性的特点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了基于模型的值迭代方法与无模型的PPO方法在呼叫中心优化中的表现，发现PPO在减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习在呼叫中心中优化来电路由、减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间的潜力。

Method: 对比基于模型的值迭代方法（VI）和无模型的近端策略优化（PPO）；基于模型方式利用理论模型，而无模型方式通过结合离散事件模拟和OpenAI Gym环境进行经验学习。

Result: PPO方法在经过1,000次测试后，表现出最高的奖励分数，客户等待时间和员工空闲时间均最短，但训练时间更长。

Conclusion: 尽管PPO训练时间较长，但其在优化呼叫中心性能方面总体优于基于模型的值迭代方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Conclusion: 通过GPU加速，CT算法的性能得到显著提升，为处理更大规模的表约束问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动与边缘计算的快速发展导致对高效低比特量化模型需求增加，而数据隐私限制了传统训练方法的应用。

Method: 提出QuaRC框架，设计相对熵评分机制选择重要核心集，并采用级联层校正策略优化量化误差。

Result: 实验结果表明，QuaRC相比现有技术显著提高了模型准确性，例如在 ResNet-18 的2-bit量化任务中，以1%的数据子集提升了5.72%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: QuaRC通过创新的核心集选择和误差校正方法，显著降低了量化误差，是边缘设备QAT的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 因果性不变知识可以提高语义通信中解码器的数据重构性能，并在跨域和时变数据中保持稳定性。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的优化方法在减少计算工作量的同时，可以获得对目标函数特征的重要见解。

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Motivation: 语言模型在排序与评价任务中对候选项的顺序敏感，这种位置偏差及重复一致性低的问题会影响模型的公平性和效率，需要改进方法来缓解这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种动态早停方法，根据实例动态确定所需的重复次数。此外，通过引入基于置信度的动态调整策略，进一步减少语言模型调用次数。

Result: 该方法在三种语言模型和两项任务中实验，平均减少了81%的调用次数，并能保持精度。此外，采用置信度调整的早停方法，进一步降低至87%的调用次数，仅带来轻微精度损失。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法有效缓解了位置偏差和重复不一致性问题，大幅提高了效率，同时保持了模型性能，具有很好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的三步方法CICME，用于在多领域数据中推断因果机制，并通过实验验证其在特定场景下的性能优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索复杂传感系统的因果关系，通过整合异质数据跨领域分析揭示普遍和个体因果机制。

Method: 提出CICME，通过因果迁移学习原则，从多领域数据中识别领域不变的因果机制，并利用已识别的共有因果机制引导个体领域因果机制的估计。

Result: 在线性高斯模型和制造过程启发的场景中验证了CICME的性能，显示其在某些场景下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CICME结合了合并数据和单个领域数据的因果发现优点，为复杂系统的因果机制推断提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种融合LLM和扩散模型的LSDM方法，解决城市环境中个体用户流量预测问题，结果表明其性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以适应不同城市环境，准确性差，需更先进的建模技术处理复杂依赖关系和动态流量分布。

Method: 提出LLM增强的时空扩散模型（LSDM），结合扩散模型的生成能力、变压器的自适应学习能力及多模态环境信息建模能力。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估显示，其在流量预测中的generalization和适应性优异，R²提高至少2.83%，RMSE减少至少8.29%。

Conclusion: LLM与扩散模型的结合能有效提升服务级别流量预测的准确性和适应能力。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式奖励模型的方法要么仅运用逐点评分，未能充分发挥LLM的比较能力，要么使用成对比较，在较大的采样预算下效率低下。

Method: 引入生成选择（GenSelect），通过长推理在N个候选解中选择最佳答案，结合LLM的比较优势并高效扩展至并行采样预算。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，诸如QwQ和DeepSeek-R1-0528等推理模型通过GenSelect显著优于现有评分方法。

Conclusion: 生成选择方法结合LLM的比较能力，可高效处理大规模的推理任务，具备良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

TL;DR: 本文引入了WGAN方法来解决高分辨率降水预测中的分辨率下采样问题，展现了较好的降水场视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率降水预测对于减少静止和局部强降水带来的损失至关重要，而传统基于物理模型的数值天气预报方法存在挑战。

Method: 提出使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）结合最优传输代价进行降水下采样，并通过批判学习实现视觉方面的真实感。

Result: WGAN生成了具备细微粒度结构的真实降水场，尽管在传统评价指标上的表现略逊，但在人类感知真实感上表现良好，同时能够通过批判分数分析识别数据中的潜在伪影问题。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提升了降水下采样的感知真实感，还为评估和质量控制降水数据集提供了新视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Motivation: 当前GNN模型的“黑箱”特性限制了其解释性，传统方法难以捕捉网络中节点的复杂交互模式。

Method: 提出GraphEXT框架，将图划分为多个独立子图，并结合外部性下的Shapley值计算，衡量节点对GNN预测的边际贡献。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集实验中，GraphEXT在各种GNN架构上的保真性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GraphEXT显著提升了GNN模型的解释性，尤其是在节点交互和结构变化影响方面表现卓越。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Motivation: 现有分子生成方法中，生成满足特定性质分子的稀缺是主要瓶颈。本研究旨在克服此问题，通过仅利用负样本数据探索分子性质生成方向。

Method: 提出分子任务算术，通过在负样本上训练模型以学习性质方向，并反向移动模型生成正样本分子，无需使用任何正样本数据。

Result: 分子任务算术在20个零次设计实验中生成的分子不仅更具多样性，其性能也优于基于正样本训练的模型，同时在双目标和少样本设计任务中具备高度有效性。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术以其简洁性、数据效率及优越性能，有潜力成为分子设计领域的主流迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决标准傅里叶神经算子（FNO）无法处理非周期输入的问题，并进一步改进随机系统动态学习的能力。

Method: 引入镜像填充技术扩展FNO的结构；利用Wong-Zakai理论和逼近技术，从理论上证明能精确逼近依赖路径的随机微分方程解及分数布朗运动的Lipschitz变换。

Result: MFNO展示出较强的分辨率泛化能力，比传统架构如LSTM、TCN和DeepONet表现更优或相当且路径生成速度更快。

Conclusion: MFNO不仅在理论上证明了其强大的逼近能力，在实验中也展现了其高效性和优越性，是处理随机系统的有效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Motivation: 寻找结合公共数据和私有数据进行差分隐私学习的方法，希望在两种数据有分布差异的场景下探讨其潜力。

Method: 扩展已有理论，分析两种数据分布发生显著变化下的高斯均值估计与高斯线性回归问题，研究两类分布差异对算法效果的影响。

Result: 发现当两种数据分布差异较小时，某种数据类型需足够多以估计私有参数；而当差异较大时，公共数据无法提供额外帮助。

Conclusion: 当有显著分布偏差时，公共数据对差分隐私学习效果有限，效果受分布差异规模影响显著。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Conclusion: 联邦学习为云机器人操作提供了新的思路，虽具有显著潜力，但需要应对技术和实现上的多方面挑战，以推广和规模化应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学的方法，推导出理想学习的新数学前提，并测试其在简单3层MLP和SOTA神经网络中的假设和预测。

Result: SETOL中的新指标ERG和HTSR中的alpha指标在简单网络和SOTA神经网络上的表现对齐得非常好，支持理论假设的有效性。

Conclusion: SETOL为理解神经网络的行为和优化提供了全面的理论支持，这可能推动未来相关领域的发展。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Result: 在三个新建设的多模态数据集及公开的Lazada-Home数据集上，实验证明MFTRR显著优于现有方法，例如在Art History数据集上NDCG@3指标提升最高达9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR框架能够有效解决现有方法中的三大问题，在多模态帖子质量评估任务中表现出显著的提升潜力。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level

three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public

outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了名为SIFOTL的方法，通过统计数据、双XGBoost模型以及Pareto加权决策树，不访问原始数据便能解析数据迁移因子，尤其适用于医疗领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据分析中的数据迁移因子识别问题，同时满足隐私限制和应对复杂过程引入的噪声。

Method: SIFOTL通过：(1) 提取隐私合规的统计摘要；(2) 使用双XGBoost模型过滤噪声和干预信号，并融入大语言模型；(3) 使用Pareto加权决策树整合输出以解析数据迁移因子。

Result: 在MEPS数据库以新药补贴为例，F1分数达0.85，超过BigQuery分析(0.46)和统计测试(0.20)。对18种EHR数据集，F1分数在无噪声情况下为0.86-0.96，有噪声情况下也达到≥0.75，而基线方法仅为0.19-0.67。

Conclusion: SIFOTL是一种可解释、有隐私保护且对观察噪声鲁棒的方法，显著提升了数据迁移因子的识别能力。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的机器学习方法，允许交通状态预测（TSEP）模型在数据隐私、数据污染或数据陈旧问题暴露时选择性“遗忘”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在交通状态预测中依赖于敏感数据，但数据隐私和安全问题可能降低公众对智能交通系统的信任，因此需要应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一种“机器遗忘”的学习范式，使TSEP模型能够选择性地忘记敏感、污染或过时的数据。

Result: 提高了数据驱动交通预测模型的可信性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过“遗忘”特性增强了交通状态预测模型的公众信任度，从而进一步推动智能交通系统的开发。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Result: 提出了一个经验缩放定律，预测了训练奖励轨迹和三个一致阶段；发现在一定训练阶段后停止训练可以减少计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至不同模型类型，为基于GRPO的高效微调提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 方法性能优异，为提高海洋学数据的空间分辨率以及解决偏微分方程问题提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种C-AAE方法，用于解决可穿戴加速度计和陀螺仪数据隐私保护问题，同时兼顾实用性和数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器数据中含有可能被恶意利用的用户身份信息，因此需要一种方法保护隐私，尤其是在医疗健康应用中。

Method: 提出了C-AAE方法，将匿名自编码器(AAE)与自适应差分脉冲编码调制(ADPCM)结合，AAE用于将传感器数据映射到活动特征而非身份特征的隐空间，ADPCM用于进一步掩盖身份信息并减少比特率。

Result: 在MotionSense和PAMAP2数据集上的实验表明，C-AAE方法相较于仅使用AAE，用户再识别F1分数降低了10-15个百分点，而保持活动识别F1分数仅下降不到5个百分点，同时数据体量缩减约75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE提供了一种有效的隐私保护与数据实用性兼顾的方法，适用于连续的传感器活动识别场景，如医疗保健应用中。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Motivation: 应对大语言模型参数规模庞大和高计算成本的问题，通过极低位量化实现存储和推理效率提升，但同时解决性能下降的挑战。

Method: 采用分阶段混合精度后训练量化框架，结合后二值化激活鲁棒性（PBAR）和全信息激活监督（FIAS），实现80%权重1位量化和20%权重4位量化。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2上实现了权重平均1.6比特的极低位量化，在六项零样本分类任务上的平均准确率从43%提高到56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM显著提升了极低位量化语言模型的性能，展示了分阶段混合精度量化的潜力。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 补充监督信息不仅可以改善泛化误差，还能在实验中简单应用中提高分类准确性，意义显著。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Motivation: 在现代移动网络中，多个MVNO对物理资源块(PRB)竞争，需要解决延时约束与资源效率之间的权衡。现有方法无法高效处理这种动态竞争，亟需一种新的解决方案。

Result: 提出模型在平均延迟降低上优于其他基线模型，达到了38%的性能提高，同时在模型权重共享策略上超过传统方法。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL通过优化延迟的同时减少了资源利用率，提出的个性化模型权重共享方法提升了多代理协同能力，为RAN切片中的资源分配问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 通过引导目标代理在关键状态下输出次优行为，本方法有效降低了其性能，展示了新的对抗攻击视角，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Motivation: 探讨如何在测试阶段利用语言模型自身的置信度提升数学推理任务的表现，并验证这一方法的高效性和普适性。

Method: 提出一种称为前缀置信度缩放的方法，通过在测试阶段选择最具有潜力的尝试（基于模型的前缀置信度），并比较其与其他方法（如多数投票）的性能。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500、AMC23、AIME24、AIME25五个数学推理数据集上评估了该方法，发现前缀置信度缩放显著优于多数投票，并且对长度偏差不敏感。然而，在测试时训练中，前缀置信度缩放仍然优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度缩放是一种有效的测试阶段优化语言模型的方法，特别是在数学推理任务中，展现了优越的性能和良好的计算效率。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Motivation: 现有针对带噪声标签数据的学习方法在评价中受限于静态快照，未能利用学习演化过程的动态信息。

Method: 提出ChronoSelect框架，通过四阶段记忆架构与滑动更新机制，压缩预测历史为时间分布，进行样本分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，ChronoSelect在多个合成和真实数据集上表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect有效利用时间轨迹信息，在带噪声标签的学习任务中实现了稳定且收敛的性能提升。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 证明了新方法在跨数据集（例如从Argoverse2训练到NuScenes验证）的效果优越。

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段目标选择方法和异构图结构有助于解决模型在未见场景中的表现问题，有助于实现更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Motivation: 现有联邦图学习方法主要依赖同步通信，低效且难以应用于实际；而现有异步联邦学习方法未考虑图数据独特的拓扑特性，直接应用会导致语义漂移和表达不一致。

Method: 提出FedSA-GCL，一个半异步联邦框架，创新性地通过ClusterCast机制结合客户端标签分布差异和图拓扑特性进行训练。

Result: 在多个真实图数据集上，FedSA-GCL分别比9个基线方法在Louvain算法下平均提升2.92%，在Metis算法下平均提升3.4%。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL框架展现了较强的鲁棒性和卓越的效率，为高效的联邦图学习提供了新路径。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Motivation: 传统的 SINDy 方法在设计候选基函数库时面临挑战，尤其是复杂动态系统中适当的库设计并非易事。

Method: 提出一种包括稀疏回归技术和库学习优化的两层优化架构方法（SINDy-LOM），内层提取数据驱动模型，外层通过递归长期预测优化基函数库。

Result: 该模型提升了模型的解释性和实用性，通过减少用户负担并改进库设计，提高了预测的可靠性。实验验证了其在复杂工业系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM 方法显著优化了传统 SINDy 的性能，通过库优化机制生成简洁且高效的模型，同时确保模型的长期预测能力和可靠性。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Motivation: 为了解决深度学习PPM方法在处理现实中事件日志数据稀少且变量低的问题，提出一种利用统计增强生成语义上有效的新的数据变体的方法。

Method: 引入SiamSA-PPM框架，结合孪生学习和统计增强，使用三种基于统计模型的转换方法生成新轨迹变体，并在无监督情况下学习通用表示。

Result: 通过对真实事件日志的大量实验，SiamSA-PPM在下一步活动预测和最终结果预测任务中表现出竞争力，甚至优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM框架证明了统计增强相比随机转换具有很大优势，并显著提升了数据的多样性，为流程预测的数据丰富化提供了一种前景可观的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Motivation: 由于恶意软件快速演变，基于ML的检测器需要不断适应，但全量重新训练并不可行。因此提出了持续学习，然而其潜在的安全回归风险问题依旧未被解决。

Method: 提出并量化了CL中的安全回归问题，并通过适配积极一致训练（PCT）设计了一种回归感知惩罚策略，以模型无关的方式保护已有预测行为。

Result: 在ELSA、Tesseract和AZ-Class数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了CL场景中的安全回归，同时保持了优异的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了安全回归问题，适用于恶意软件检测等对安全性要求较高的领域，为持续学习技术的风险控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

Motivation: 随着电动车和储能系统的普及，电池健康监测变得更加重要，但传统估算方法在处理不规则数据时存在局限性。

Method: 提出TIDSIT模型，利用连续时间嵌入和时间注意机制处理不规则采样数据和变长输入，同时保留完整的序列信息。

Result: TIDSIT在NASA电池退化数据集上显著优于现有模型，预测误差降低超过50%，SoH预测误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT不仅在电池SoH预测中表现优异，还在处理其他不规则时间序列数据的健康监测任务中具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

Motivation: 当前MARL方法通过共适应学习的简单习惯可能导致脆弱性，并未充分测试Dec-POMDP核心假设。

Method: 通过案例研究显示共适应学习的缺陷，并分析现有环境的不足，提出改进建议。

Result: 证明现代理论模型可以学习更稳健的策略，但现有评估环境可能误导学习过程。

Conclusion: 需要基于观测和记忆的多智能体合作环境设计，以提升MARL算法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Motivation: 现有HyperDeepONets架构具备高表达性，但因需要生成大量权重参数导致内存和计算成本高。作者希望通过一种方法减少这种成本，同时提升模型性能。

Method: 在低秩适配（LoRA）的基础上，将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，从而减少可训练参数及对主网络权重进行额外正则化。

Result: 通过大量的常微分方程和偏微分方程实验，PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets在参数减少70%的情况下，一致地超越普通HyperDeepONets的预测准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets在保持性能甚至提升的同时显著降低了计算复杂性，为物理信息机器学习中的操作学习提供了一种高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Conclusion: 证明了通过证据蒸馏可以在LLMs中高效地实现即时和稳健的不确定性估算。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对许多地区缺乏足够河流流量观测的数据匮乏问题，现有降雨径流分析的能力受到限制，亟需一种在稀缺数据条件下，兼具高精度、解释性和计算效率的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为HYPER的技术方法，将贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）与储层计算（RC）结合。HYPER利用BMA对43个基于流域的概念型水文模型输出进行误差校正，通过线性回归训练RC模型，实现高效的非迭代计算。而对于无测量数据的地区，则通过流域属性推断BMA和RC权重，建立可泛化的框架。

Result: 通过在日本87个河流流域的数据验证发现：在数据充足条件下，HYPER的性能（KGE为0.56）可与LSTM相媲美，但所需计算时间仅为后者的5%。在数据匮乏条件下，HYPER依然保持稳健性能（KGE为0.55），相对不确定性较低，而LSTM的性能显著下降（KGE为-0.04）。

Conclusion: HYPER展示了，在数据稀缺条件下，通过整合大规模的非校准水文模型并结合机器学习偏差校正技术，可以不需要单独校准单个模型。该方法是排水预测的稳健、高效且通用的解决方案，适用于广泛区域，尤其是无测量数据的流域。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge

*Leiji Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Xin Li,Yao-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本论文针对传统仿真度量在强化学习中的不足，提出了一种改进方法并在两个主要基准上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仿真度量无法处理某些特殊场景，且依赖于预设的权重参数，导致效果受限。

Method: 通过引入对状态-动作对的度量，提出一种改进的仿真度量：更精确地定义奖励差距，并采用具有自适应系数的更新算子。

Result: 理论上证明了改进仿真度量的收敛性与更强的表示能力；实验结果表明其在DeepMind Control和Meta-World基准上效果优越。

Conclusion: 改进后的仿真度量不仅在理论上有保证，还能在实际任务中表现出色，为强化学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLANCE是一种针对异质图的增强图表示学习框架，融合逻辑推理、动态图优化和自适应聚类，取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNNs难以处理异质图，因其难以有效聚合区别特征且未充分利用高级结构模式。

Method: 提出GLANCE框架，包括逻辑层的结构化嵌入、多头注意力的边剪枝去噪机制及全局模式聚类机制。

Result: 在Cornell、Texas和Wisconsin等基准数据集上表现出竞争力，提供了鲁棒和可解释的异质图处理解决方案。

Conclusion: GLANCE框架轻量化、适应性强，特别适合处理异质图挑战。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为C2G-KD的数据无依赖知识蒸馏框架，采用类条件生成器和PCA几何约束生成合成样本，无需依赖真实训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无真实数据情况下进行知识蒸馏的问题，同时保持生成样本的语义和拓扑一致性。

Method: 利用类条件生成器和PCA的类特定子空间约束，通过语义和结构损失学习生成能激活教师模型输出的合成样本。

Result: 实验表明，仅需每类两例真实样本估算PCA，即可在MNIST数据集上实现有效的合成训练。

Conclusion: 少量的类结构信息足以支持有用的合成训练管道，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [216] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用的力-度量-偏差（FMB）定律，揭示了自然选择、贝叶斯更新、优化算法等多种过程的共同数学结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索学习算法、优化方法和自然选择之间的共有数学框架，统一这些看似不同的过程，从而为跨学科设计和理解学习算法提供理论基础。

Method: 通过对Price方程的符号化分割，提出一个FMB定律，描述参数变化为力、度量、偏差和噪声四个部分的组合。

Result: 将自然选择、贝叶斯更新、牛顿法、随机梯度下降等统一为一个基本过程，并解释了Fisher信息、Kullback-Leibler散度等在学习动态中自然出现的原因。

Conclusion: FMB定律提供了理解、比较和设计学习算法的新视角，具有跨学科的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究证明将GPTQ方法应用于线性层时，与求解经典CVP问题的Babai最接近平面算法在数学上是等效的，赋予GPTQ明确的几何解释和误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将大型语言模型的权重从16位降低到更低的比特宽度，以部署到更经济的硬件加速器，是一种普遍的方法。GPTQ是大型语言模型后训练量化的标准方法，但其工作原理缺乏清晰的几何解释和最坏情况下的保证。

Method: 通过数学推导，证明GPTQ在反向执行时等价于Babai的最近平面算法。该分析基于输入层Hessian矩阵上的格点理论，为GPTQ提供了几何意义和误差上界的解释。

Result: 确认了GPTQ方法与Babai算法的数学等价性。GPTQ的误差传播过程拥有了直观的几何解释，并在无裁剪条件下继承了Babai算法的误差上界。

Conclusion: 通过建立GPTQ与经典格点算法的连接，该研究为GPTQ提供了坚实的理论基础，并将格点算法研究的成果引入未来超大模型量化算法的设计中。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Motivation: 随着人工智能在高风险领域和决策中的应用增多，测试潜在的危害和偏见变得至关重要。然而，法律、隐私和数据代表性问题使得公平性测试缺乏必要的数据支持，从而限制了独立审计的能力。

Method: 利用分散的、交叠的数据集构建包含人口统计信息的完整合成数据，并通过真实数据验证合成数据的真实性，同时对公平性指标进行评估。

Result: 实验证明，通过合成数据进行的公平性测试与真实数据测试结果一致。这表明合成数据能有效替代真实数据，用于模型的公平性评估。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种方法，在现实数据有限的情况下，通过利用合成数据实现独立、与模型无关的公平性评估，解决了现实世界中数据稀缺对公平性测试的限制问题。

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的SE(2)不变注意力机制，只需线性内存即可处理空间数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SE(2)不变架构虽然在处理空间数据任务中表现优越，但计算所有对象对之间的相对位姿需要二次内存。

Method: 设计了一种SE(2)不变的缩放点积注意力机制，将内存需求从二次降低到线性，应用于变压器架构中。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法不仅实际可行，还可提升性能，与非不变架构相比有显著进步。

Conclusion: 新提出的线性内存SE(2)不变机制为自动驾驶相关的学习任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效结合多层次结构信息生成高质量蛋白质，同时提出的评估指标强化了对生成蛋白质功能与分布一致性的评估。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Result: 实验证明，BASS在AI-AI和人-AI协作中均优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: “Moving Out”及其BASS方法为物理约束下的人机协作提供了新视角，表现出优越的适应性和性能。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny

system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.

Motivation: 神经形态计算因其低功耗特性逐渐受到关注，但其潜在的计算价值和适用性尚未得到清晰定义。

Method: 通过分析传统处理架构和NMC在时间、空间和能量扩展特性上的差异，以及两者在特定算法中的性能表现，评估其计算能力。

Result: 神经形态计算的时间和空间扩展与理论无限处理器系统相当，但能量扩展特性存在显著差异，并更适合稀疏性和规模可扩展的算法。

Conclusion: NMC架构由于其能量扩展特性和对特定算法的适应性，适合一些非常规算法，如迭代优化和大规模采样，其潜力值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

Motivation: 针对AI负载中常见的输入值接近零的特点，有需求设计高效的固定点乘法器以降低功耗并确保电路逻辑等价性。

Method: 通过将固定点乘法器单元分解为编码模块和乘法模块来单独优化，使用两步合成分别处理2's补码到符号幅值表示的转换以及计算，同时探索开关活动优化设计空间。

Result: 在模拟中，4-bit乘法器设计在标准正态分布输入情况下节能12.9%，在凭较小输入范围时提升至33%，通过开关活动驱动设计进一步提升功率效率5-10%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解和优化固定点乘法单元，在保持逻辑等价的同时，大幅节省功耗，特别适合AI工作负载应用。

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

Conclusion: 此研究不仅阐明了ESNs的神经科学基础，还通过数学严谨性提供了可靠的设计准则，有助于更高效的时间序列处理系统的发展。

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.
