### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法ResPA，利用残差梯度作为扰动方向指导对抗样本趋向损失函数的平坦区域，并证明其优越的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对深度神经网络容易受到对抗样本攻击且现有迁移攻击方法在扰动方向选择上存在不足。

Method: 提出Residual Perturbation Attack (ResPA)方法，通过对输入梯度进行指数移动平均得到参考梯度，并利用当前梯度与参考梯度的残差作为扰动方向进行优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有迁移攻击方法相比，ResPA方法具有更好的可迁移性，同时，与输入变换方法结合后进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA有效提高了对抗样本的迁移能力，并能与现有技术结合增强效果。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架（GOOD），通过引入辅助的一般知识模型（GKM）来提高少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本OOD检测因过度拟合有限的训练数据导致泛化能力不足，表现不一致。

Method: 提出了Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD)框架，引入一般知识模型（GKM），并通过Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)机制动态调整模型输出分布，提高GS平衡。

Result: 实验表明，在真实世界的OOD基准测试中，该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 使用一般知识模型有效减少泛化误差的上限，增强了少样本OOD检测的稳健性。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了UnGuide方法，通过动态调整无指导(Classifier-Free Guidance)机制，实现了基于LoRA的选择性卸载特定概念，保持了模型的整体性能。实验结果表明，UnGuide在去除指定对象和显性内容方面优于现有的LoRA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本生成图像扩散模型可能被滥用，带来有害内容生成的风险，因此需要有效的方法来卸载指定知识或概念，同时不损害整体性能。

Method: 引入UnGuide方法，结合动态的无指导机制，通过调整消噪过程中前几步的指导强度，实现选择性概念卸载。对于涉及需卸载概念的提示，利用LoRA模块配合基模型控制内容生成；对于非相关提示，则依赖基模型以保持生成内容的真实性。

Result: 实验结果展示了UnGuide相较于现有基于LoRA的方法，在去除特定对象和显性内容任务上的优越性，成功实现了受控的概念卸载及扩散模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide为扩散模型提供了一个高效的解决方案，实现了针对性知识移除的同时保留了模型的生成能力，显示出比传统方法更优越的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，能够更准确地将艺术风格应用于图像的特定区域，同时通过网络内部融合技术提升了区域选择的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的风格迁移方法通常应用于整个图像，但用户可能只需要对图像的特定区域进行风格迁移，而现有的解决方案在区域特定风格的捕捉上表现不足。

Method: 通过提出基于部分卷积的网络框架，结合内部融合技术，使得风格迁移能够更准确地限定于图像感兴趣的特定区域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉效果和量化指标上均优于传统方法，并在SA-1B数据集上验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种改进的风格迁移方法，实现了更精确的局部风格应用，提升了用户体验并为后续研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了MAISI-v2，一种用于快速和高质量3D医学图像合成的加速框架，通过采用改进的扩散模型解决了以往方法中存在的通用性、推断速度和条件一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像合成方法在通用性、生成速度和条件一致性方面存在局限性，迫切需要更高效且精准的解决方案。

Method: 提出了MAISI-v2框架，结合校正流以提高生成速度，并引入一种区域特定对比损失函数来增强对感兴趣区域的敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，MAISI-v2可在33倍加速的前提下实现最先进的图像质量。此外，分割实验验证了合成图像在数据增强中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2提供了快速、高质量且条件一致的医学图像合成，具有良好的实际应用潜力，并通过开源促进社区进一步发展。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过MAE预训练策略实现的MRI transformer模型框架，在少样本条件下表现突出，适用于不同的脑成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服医学影像中标注数据稀缺的限制，提升transformers在实际应用中的可行性。

Method: 应用MAE预训练策略，在包含超3100万张切片的大规模多队列MRI数据集上训练出可高效迁移的潜在表示，用于分类（冻结的MAE编码器+轻量级线性头）和分割任务（提出MAE-FUnet架构）。

Result: 分类任务中，冻结的MAE编码器实现最优准确度；而在分割任务中，MAE-FUnet在数据有限条件下优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架在效率、稳定性和可扩展性方面表现优秀，适合低资源临床环境及神经影像学更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯飞溅风格迁移方法，使用图结构和基于表面的风格化方法快速实现风格迁移，速度快且无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多高斯飞溅风格迁移方法需要重建、微调或优化网络，而这种依赖过程限制了使用的便捷性和速度。

Method: 通过生成高斯飞溅表示的隐式表面图结构，并使用基于表面的前馈风格化方法，再插值回个体飞溅实现风格迁移。

Result: 所提方法能在消费级硬件上实现2分钟以内的快速飞溅风格迁移，结果质量良好并优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 新方法实现了无需额外训练与优化的高效高斯飞溅风格迁移，具备高度便捷性和实用性，相关代码开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN 是一种改进型 NeRF 方法，专为多视图不一致的多缩放图像集设计，旨在更好解决工业中微米级精度检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 NeRF 方法在处理具有未知相机姿态的 2D 图像生成 3D 重建时表现出色，但难以捕捉工业检测中需要的细微结构问题。

Method: MZEN 增强了针孔相机模型，引入显式、可学习的缩放标量，用于调节焦距。并提出一种新颖的姿态策略：先用广角图像建立全局坐标框架，再通过裁剪匹配过程将缩放图像与最近广角图像对齐并共同优化。

Result: 实验显示，MZEN 在8个场景中表现优于基线方法和高分辨率变体，在 PSNR、SSIM 和 LPIPS 等指标上均大幅提升。

Conclusion: MZEN 将 NeRF 扩展至工业应用场景，显著提升细节保留能力并兼顾全局精度，适应生产环境中的微米级检测需求。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了适用于手术视频分析的TSMS-SAM2框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强与内存分割和修剪机制应对快速运动和内存冗余问题，显著提升了分割精度与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型如Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)在手术视频分析中的表现受限于复杂运动动态和内存冗余问题，因此需要改进以适应特定领域需求。

Method: 引入两种策略：多时间尺度的视频采样增强以提升对运动变化的鲁棒性，内存分割与修剪机制以优化帧特征的组织与过滤，从而提高分割效率和准确性。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上测试，TSMS-SAM2分别取得了95.24和86.73的平均Dice分数，优于现有SAM-based和任务特定方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2框架有效提升了手术视频中的目标分割性能，为复杂手术场景下的鲁棒高效分割提供了新的解决方案，并确认其关键策略的有效性。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

### [10] [Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851)
*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA)的方法，旨在通过利用视频帧之间的时间一致性优化分割模型的性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的Swin Transformer模型在视频分割中存在高计算成本的问题，特别是在资源受限的实时应用中。这主要是由于窗口注意力机制需要固定数量的tokens，这限制了传统剪枝技术的应用。此外，现有的无训练token聚类方法未能利用视频的时间冗余。

Method: 提出了一种名为TCA（Temporal Cluster Assignment）的新策略，通过利用视频帧间的时间关联性，在无需额外训练的情况下优化token聚类，从而减少计算开销并保留细粒度的细节信息。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS 2019、YouTube-VIS 2021、OVIS和一个私人手术视频数据集上进行了广泛的评估。结果表明，与现有方法相比，TCA在精度和速度之间取得了更优的平衡，并能够在自然视频和特定领域视频中良好泛化。

Conclusion: TCA通过结合时间一致性优化了视频分割的性能，是一种轻量级且有效的代替高计算成本的方法，可提升现有基于聚类方法的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

### [11] [VISTA: Vision-Language Imitation of Situational Thinking and Attention for Human-Like Driver Focus in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05852)
*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种视觉-语言框架，可通过自然语言预测驾驶员视线焦点的变化，采用少样本及零样本学习，进而为自动驾驶中的可解释性AI提供了一种新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大部分研究仅集中于静态RGB图片上的单时刻注意力分配预测，缺乏对驾驶员视线动态分布的语言化描述。

Method: 构建并优化BDD-A数据集中的高质量字幕，通过人机反馈调整，然后微调LLaVA模型，将视觉感知与以注意力为中心的场景理解对齐，结合低层次特征和高层次语义完成预测。同时设计了新的领域特定指标评估语义对齐与响应多样性。

Result: 实验表明，经过微调的模型在注意力转移检测和结果解释性方面优于通用视觉语言模型（VLMs）。

Conclusion: 本文首次尝试通过自然语言描述驾驶员注意力分布与变化，为自动驾驶可解释性AI打开了新方向，并为行为预测、人机协作及多主体协调等下游任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出利用多个摄像机视角进行注视目标估计的新方法，引入多个模块优化结果，并超越单视角方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角方法的局限性，如面部遮挡、目标歧义和目标脱离视野。

Method: 使用多视角输入，包含：1. 头部信息聚合模块（HIA）；2. 基于不确定性的注视选择模块（UGS）；3. 基于极线的场景关注模块（ESA）。

Result: 新方法显著优于单视角基准，尤其在辅助摄像机能清晰看到面部时，方法甚至可利用第二视角数据估计第一个视角的注视目标。

Conclusion: 多视角方法提升注视目标估计的准确性与灵活性，并公开多视角数据集以支持领域发展。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的高效测试时自适应方法(ETTA)，实现了在分布变化时更准确的视觉-语言模型调整，同时降低计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练视觉-语言模型在分布变化下泛化能力差的问题，并优化现有TTA方法在存储和计算效率上的局限性。

Method: 引入递归更新模块和自适应集成模块，通过动态整合测试数据及使用最优提示，结合两者结果，提高决策边界精确性和减少依赖提示。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，ETTA在计算复杂性和准确率上超过当前最佳TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA提出了一种有效且高效的测试时自适应方案，为视觉-语言模型的分布变化下应用提供了新的标准。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0能生成具有高语义保真度的3D场景，涉及广泛风格和场景，并在游戏程序建模中展示了提升效率的潜力。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available
at {\color{red}https://github.com/MmelodYy/RopStitch}.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过引入光交互建模和可微损失策略，成功解决了单张图像法线估计中的多重问题，减少了对密集注释的依赖，展示了优越的性能。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Result: 实验表明，Bifrost-1 在视觉保真度和多模态理解方面的性能与现有方法相当或更好，同时训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Bifrost-1 框架能够高效地融合多模态大模型与扩散模型，实现了高效且高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Motivation: 解决任务语义和几何特征之间缺乏语义锚定的问题，克服手动标注的局限性，增强语义-可操作性理解。

Method: 引入PASG框架，包含三部分：通过几何特征聚合进行自动原语提取；利用视觉语言模型动态关联几何原语与功能性可操作性；建立空间语义推理基准及微调VLM模型。

Conclusion: PASG建立了一种将几何原语与任务语义连接的统一范式，提高了机器人操作任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene 提供了一个简单但高效的框架，能在动态 3D 场景中实现高质量的 4D 人物和场景融合，为未来应用提供了可靠方案。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，室外平均提高6.94%，室内平均提高10.23%。

Conclusion: ETA显著改善了深度完成模型在测试时的适配性，具有优异的性能表现。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Conclusion: 提出的系统能有效减少冗余，提高处理效率，为视频计算机视觉提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成低质量化妆编辑结果，难以保留面部身份和化妆细节的忠实度，原因是缺少结构化的配对数据。

Method: 引入了高质量数据集MakeupQuad，并提出一种多阶段蒸馏训练框架EvoMakeup，该方法能解决图像降解问题，提升数据和模型质量。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实环境基准测试中表现优异，支持高保真、可控和多任务的化妆编辑（包括基于全脸、局部参考及文本驱动的化妆编辑）。

Conclusion: EvoMakeup能够实现优质效果，在化妆忠实度和身份保留之间达成了良好的平衡。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

### [29] [Learning 3D Texture-Aware Representations for Parsing Diverse Human Clothing and Body Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06032)
*Kiran Chhatre,Christopher Peters,Srikrishna Karanam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前的人体解析方法通常使用固定且宽泛的标签，无法细分衣物类型。而光谱模型(Spectrum)结合了I2Tx扩散模型和提示引导的语义分割，专注于人体部位和衣物的像素级解析以及实例级分组，在多个实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的人体解析方法在区分人体细节和多样化的衣物方面存在不足，多为单一人物类别的广泛概括，难以精确解析到不同人体部位和衣物类型。

Method: 提出Spectrum模型，通过一种基于I2Tx扩散模型的创新方法，该模型精调于3D人体纹理图，通过提示引导实现与人体部位和衣物的对齐，并生成语义分割图。

Result: 实验表明，Spectrum在跨数据集的人体部位、衣物部件、不可见衣物类别和全身掩码解析任务中，比基准方法表现更优。

Conclusion: Spectrum模型有效解决了现有方法对人体部位和衣物解析精度的不足，可生成精确的语义分割图，并表现出良好的广泛通用性。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为InstantEdit的快速文本引导图像编辑方法，能够在保持重要内容的同时精确跟随文本指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本引导图像编辑方法常面临编辑速度慢、细节保存能力不足的问题，本研究旨在克服这些挑战。

Method: 基于RectifiedFlow框架，提出了PerRFI专用逆向策略、反转潜变量注入法，以及解耦提示引导技术，并结合Canny条件ControlNet以改善结构完整性和减少伪影。

Result: 在PIE图像编辑数据集的评价中，比起先进的少步编辑方法，InstantEdit表现出更快的速度和更好的质与量效果。

Conclusion: InstantEdit在提供快速与高质量的图像编辑方面具有明显优势，能有效平衡编辑能力与细节保留。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

*Huanyu Wang,Jushi Kai,Haoli Bai,Lu Hou,Bo Jiang,Ziwei He,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的视觉-语言模型方法，通过在频域中压缩视觉表示来降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言模型中视觉特征导致上下文长度增加以及计算开销和推理延迟的问题。

Method: 通过离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，在低频段压缩视觉信息，同时使用快速傅里叶变换（FFT）高效计算。

Result: Fourier-VLM在多个基准测试中表现出色，与现有架构具有较强的通用性，并显著减少推理浮点运算次数（高达83.8%）和生成速度（提升31.2%）。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM是一种简单高效的方法，能够在不增加额外参数的情况下，大幅提升计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自动回归图像生成的文本引导图像编辑新方法，特别解决了现有方法中计算成本高和非编辑区域重建偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建整个目标图像，导致额外计算成本且降低了编辑质量，作者希望优化此问题。

Method: 提出了一种称为Next Editing-token Prediction (NEP)的方法，通过自动回归生成仅编辑目标区域的图像并结合预训练的任意顺序自动回归文本到图像模型实现。

Result: 模型在广泛应用的图像编辑基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平，并支持零样本方式的测试时刻扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法优化了图像编辑过程中的计算效率和编辑质量，展示了其卓越的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理的VQA框架VQAThinker，通过强化学习和多模态模型来实现对视频质量的理解和评分，解决现有方法在泛化性和可解释性上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VQA模型在对分布外视频的泛化能力和可解释性方面存在重大不足，制约其实际应用。

Method: 采用以规则为指导的强化学习算法（GRPO），并引入了三种VQA特定奖励机制：1. 钟形回归奖励；2. 成对排名奖励；3. 时间一致性奖励。

Result: VQAThinker在域内和分布外VQA基准测试中表现出色，并在失真归因和质量描述任务中超越现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习是一种通过仅使用评分级别监督构建可泛化且可解释的VQA模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侧脑室形状分析作为神经疾病的生物标志物有潜力，但由于个体差异和MRI分辨率限制造成的分割困难，分析仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过使用一个结合解剖关系的侧脑室-海马联合模板网格，LV-Net减少了分界分割伪影，增强了网格顶点的点对应性，从而提高形状统计的准确性。

Result: LV-Net在分割缺陷存在的情况下依然实现了更高的重建精度，并在不同数据集之间提供了更可靠的形状描述符。

Conclusion: 通过分析阿尔茨海默病数据，LV-Net发现了与认知正常对照组相比显著相关的侧脑室子区域，这验证了其作为形状分析工具的效用。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合事件相机与Quad Bayer CFA传感器结合后产生的去马赛克伪影和重建问题，且适用于资源受限的移动设备。

Method: 设计了TSANet，两阶段模型通过交叉注意力分别处理事件像素的填充和去马赛克问题，并引入轻量化的Cross-Swin State Block以增强全局依赖性。

Result: TSANet在七个数据集上实现了比DemosaicFormer更高的PSNR和SSIM，同时参数和计算成本分别减少1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上高效的图像去马赛克开辟了新方向，可在低成本下实现优异的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the
supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了同时进行显著性目标检测(SOD)和伪装目标检测(COD)的问题，并提出SCJoint联合学习方案和一种基于显著性的取样策略(SBSS)，展示了共同学习的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOD任务和COD任务本质上是对立的，但作者认为通过正确的学习方法，可以使两种任务在联合学习中相互补益，提高网络性能。

Method: 提出SCJoint联合学习方案，在全共享网络结构中插入任务特定的可学习参数，以最小代价解决SOD和COD任务间的矛盾。此外，提出Saliency-Based Sampling Strategy(SBSS)用于平衡两任务训练集大小和提高数据质量。

Result: 基于SCJoint和SBSS训练的JoNet网络同时在SOD和COD任务上取得了优异性能，实验结果展示了方法的竞争力和有效性。

Conclusion: 证明了通过正确设计的联合学习方案，SOD和COD任务可以受益于彼此的特性，提升双方的任务性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

<details>

Motivation: 目前的评估方法无法提供即时、直观、具辨识度的性能差异反馈，因此需要探索新的评估框架。

Method: 采用视觉动画和点光源成像生物运动模式，相较模型差异；使用成对比较方法并收集超过45000次投票数据。

Result: 实验分析表明，众包投票与专家评分高度一致，且90%以上的评估模型未能生成基本的人体点光灯组。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena提供了具挑战性的性能可视化基准和灵活的评估框架，有助于更清晰地表现大模型能力差距。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Motivation: 目前治疗滑车发育不良的主要方法依赖于低分辨率的临床MR扫描和手术经验，结果不稳定且技术应用受限。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示计算各向同性高分辨率MR图像，使用多标记网络对骨骼分割，并通过小波扩散模型生成滑车区域的健康目标形态。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

*Yanxiao Sun,Jiafu Wu,Yun Cao,Chengming Xu,Yabiao Wang,Weijian Cao,Donghao Luo,Chengjie Wang,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为SwiftVideo的新框架，用于改进视频合成，实现快速高质量的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频合成模型需要多次迭代采样会导致计算开销过大，而现有的蒸馏方法在少步设定下容易在性能和质量上受损，因此需要一种稳定有效的方法加速模型生成过程。

Method: SwiftVideo结合了轨迹保持（trajectory-preserving）与分布匹配（distribution-matching）策略，提出了基于连续时间一致性的蒸馏模型，并设计了双视角对齐策略，包括数据分布对齐和不同推理步长的轨迹对齐。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo显著优于现有方法，尤其是在少步视频生成场景下具备明显优势。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo能在大幅降低推理步骤的同时，保持高质量的视频生成效果，为视频生成领域提供了一种高效稳定的新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

*Weichen Zhang,Zhui Zhu,Ningbo Li,Kebin Liu,Yunhao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptInfer是一种用于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的动态视觉token剪枝方法，可减少CUDA延迟并提升任务效率，同时保持高精度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理阶段处理大量视觉token，带来了高昂的计算成本，而现有剪枝方法难以充分利用推理过程中动态生成的内部信号。

Method: 提出AdaptInfer框架，包含两个核心设计：1）基于动态文本引导的剪枝机制，利用逐层的文本—文本注意力图构建视觉token的重要性评分；2）基于跨模态注意力变化的离线分析设计更高效的剪枝调度。

Result: 实验表明，在保持92.9%平均准确率的同时，AdaptInfer将CUDA延迟降低了61.3%，并在相同token预算下超越当前最优方法的精度表现。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量化、可扩展、多任务通用，为降低VLM推理成本提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Q-CLIP的框架，利用Vision-Language Models (VLMs)解决视频质量评估问题，通过共享跨模态适配器和质量级别的提示设计，提升模型效率与性能，实验效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频质量评估(VQA)方法依赖于在大规模分类数据集上预训练，再微调于VQA数据集，但存在语义知识不足以及计算资源需求高两大限制。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，基于VLMs，通过共享跨模态适配器(SCMA)简化训练参数，以及使用可学习的质量级别提示增强模型对质量变化的敏感性。同时比较不同帧采样策略的效果。

Result: 实验表明，Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP通过创新性的架构设计和策略优化，实现了低计算成本的同时，还提升了视频质量评估性能。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Conclusion: 此方法可以在多种情感条件下生成真实的反应动作，提高动作生成的自然性和互动性，并将在公开平台共享数据和代码。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

TL;DR: 先进的图像编辑工具对视觉内容的真实性构成威胁，现有方法依赖于大规模高质量数据集，存在数据不足问题，本文提出了基于扩散模型的UGD-IML框架，统一处理IML和CIML任务。


<details>

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果显示，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务的F1指标上平均分别高出SOTA方法9.66和4.36，且在不确定性估计、可视化及鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文提出的UGD-IML框架以生成性扩散模型为基础，简化了图像篡改定位任务，通过统一框架提高了两类任务的性能，同时降低对标注数据和复杂流程的依赖，在多个方面均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有跨模态检索方法在噪声标签条件下容易过拟合，需提出更加健壮的解决方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为MCA的框架，包括多模态联合标签校正机制和多级自适应对齐策略，用于改进标签一致性和跨模态特征对齐。

Result: MCA在传统和真实噪声3D基准上均达到当前最优性能，展现通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: MCA方法通过提升标签校正和跨模态语义对齐，实现了2D-3D检索领域的技术进步，适用于噪声条件下的数据。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决HMER任务中二维结构、符号尺度变化及复杂空间关系带来的挑战，减少对高昂标注数据的依赖。

Method: 1) 采用全局和局部对比损失进行图像编码器预训练；2) 引入自监督注意力网络，结合渐进式空间掩码策略训练；3) 利用 Transformer 解码器进行监督微调生成 LATEX 序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在 CROHME 基准测试中优于现有自监督和完全监督方法。

Conclusion: 创新的自监督注意力机制证明其在增强结构理解和提升HMER任务表现中的有效性。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在科学图表理解方面表现欠佳，尤其在复杂的基准测试中成功率较低（30%-50%），因此需改进模型的训练和性能。

Method: 提出一个五步数据合成管线（包括单图生成、子图条件生成、视觉多样化、低质量数据过滤、生成QA对），生成了具有高复杂性和多样化特性的有效图表数据集（ECD）。

Result: 实验表明，使用ECD训练能够显著提高各种MLLM在真实世界及合成测试集上的表现。

Conclusion: ECD数据集为MLLM在科学图表理解领域带来了显著提升，同时也是一种高效生成微调数据集的方法。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

TL;DR: FMCE-Net++通过引入新的训练框架来改进深度神经网络的性能，并在无需修改架构或增加数据的前提下实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNNs）内部结构复杂，因此难以解释。现有的FMCE方法未经过实验证明且缺乏闭环集成。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++训练框架，将预训练冻结的FMCE-Net作为辅助模块，生成特征映射收敛分数（FMCS）。通过引入表示辅助损失（RAL），动态平衡任务分类损失和特征收敛优化，以提升模型表现。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10、FashionMNIST和CIFAR-100等数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明FMCE-Net++显著提升性能，例如 ResNet-50 在 CIFAR-10 数据集上精度提升+1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++在不改变网络架构或增加额外数据的情况下，有效提升了状态-of-the-art的分类性能，为深度学习模型提供了新的改进方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自主驾驶方法因依赖Transformer融合而存在计算复杂度高与缺乏空间先验的限制，影响性能表现。

Method: 提出了GMF-Drive框架，包括几何增强的pillar格式的LiDAR表示与层次化门控融合的SSM架构，用以高效捕捉驾驶场景中的长程依赖关系和空间特性。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试上表现出显著优势，超越当前最先进的DiffusionDrive模型。

Conclusion: 专项设计的SSM在性能与效率上均优于通用Transformer，是自动驾驶任务中更优的选择。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SynSeg的新型弱监督语义分割方法，通过多类别对比学习和特征融合结构提升性能，在多个基准测试中超越了最新的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放词汇场景下语义分割的语义错位和性能低下问题，这些问题源于现有弱监督方法对类别特定监督的依赖以及不适合对比学习的特征构建方法。

Method: 提出了多类别对比学习（MCCL）策略结合特征协同结构（FSS）框架。MCCL通过组合类别内和类别间对比增强训练信号，FSS通过先验融合和语义激活图增强重建区分性特征，避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著超越了SOTA。例如，在VOC基准上提高4.5%，Context基准上提升8.9%，Object基准上提高2.6%，City基准上提升2.0%。

Conclusion: SynSeg在弱监督条件下有效提升了语义定位和区分能力，展现了较强的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Motivation: 研究的动机是通过表示学习算法开发更高效的卫星图像数据处理与天气事件分类方法，同时探索深度学习中潜在空间维度对分类性能的影响。

Method: 使用了三种算法：PCA（经典线性变换）、CAE（深度学习卷积自编码器）和预训练的残差网络（PT），并测试了不同分辨率的数据集和潜在空间维度对分类任务的影响。

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现优异，PT在热带气旋识别中表现突出，而PCA尽管命中率高，但假警率也偏高。高分辨率数据集对深度学习算法更有利，潜在空间维度较小对假警率影响较大。

Conclusion: CAE方法高效但解释性不足，提出通过物理知识引入至CAE以增强其解释性将是未来重要方向。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Result: SC-Captioner在各种场景中生成的图像字幕优于直接偏好优化训练方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SC-Captioner在图像字幕生成和质量评估方面表现优异，为未来研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

*Yi Qin,Rui Wang,Tao Huang,Tong Xiao,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VeSCA的新方法，通过SAM的编码器生成可转移攻击实例，提高了12.7%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解SAM模型在零次学习中存在的脆弱性，并兼顾其在下游应用中的安全性需求。

Method: 设计了名为VeSCA的方法，通过参数化单纯复形识别共享脆弱区域，并通过逐点优化生成对抗样本。

Result: 在步骤和领域多样性实验中，VeSCA的性能比现有方法平均提高了12.7%。

Conclusion: 验证了VeSCA方法的有效性，同时强调了开发更强健的基础模型的紧迫性。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中对3D旋转和平移建模不够显式的问题，提升视线重定向的真实感和准确性。

Method: 引入显式的3D眼球结构，并结合3D高斯投影来实现3D变换，同时使用自适应变形模块模拟眼周细微肌肉运动。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模和细节捕捉，该方法显著提升了视线重定向任务的效果，为生成高质量与多样视线图片奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在稀疏IMU与单目相机相结合的实时人体运动捕捉领域，存在时序视觉信息可能因障碍物遮挡或目标脱离镜头视野而不可用的问题，同时需要充分利用IMU信号的时序特性。

Method: 提出一种基于扩散模型的框架，将时序视觉信息转化为一个条件嵌入，同时将IMU测量信号与噪声化的姿态逐帧结合，作为模型输入，以适应不同信号特性。

Conclusion: 结合扩散模型以及对两类信号的特性深入考虑，该方法在实现实时性与鲁棒性方面表现优越，可有效应对时序视觉信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are
available for research at https://shaohua-pan.github.io/diffcap-page.

Motivation: 在MLLM快速发展的背景下，其输出的安全性问题受到关注，而现有数据集可能过时且受数据污染影响，需要更加动态和灵活的评估方法。

Method: 设计了SDEval框架，采用文本、图像及文本-图像动态策略生成新样本。同时分析了文本和图像动态对模型安全性的独立和交互影响。

Conclusion: SDEval作为一个通用框架，为现有的安全和能力评估基准提供动态的、安全的测试方法，可持续适应MLLM发展。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.

Motivation: 传统技术（例如NeRF）在水下环境中因光学特性限制，表现出效率低下以及空间分辨率不足的问题。

Method: 框架提出了两个创新：1）可扩展的学习型水下图像生成模块，基于体素回归处理空间衰减和后向散射；2）物理感知的不确定性剪枝模块，通过不确定性评分自适应移除噪声漂浮高斯点云。

Result: 实验表明，UW-3DGS在SeaThru-NeRF和UWBundle数据集上表现优异，PSNR达27.604，SSIM为0.868，LPIPS为0.104，并减少了约65%的浮动伪影。

Conclusion: UW-3DGS显著提升了水下3D重构性能，为水下影像生成和环境理解提供了卓越的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC框架不仅提高了AD诊断的效果，还具有良好的模型解释性，为未来的诊断提供了新见解。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Result: 实验表明，PostDiff能有效地提升现有最先进扩散模型的生成质量与效率之间的权衡性能。此外，在保持生成质量的同时，降低单步推理成本往往比减少去噪步骤更有效。

Conclusion: PostDiff 在无需训练的情况下，显著提升了扩散模型的效率，展示了降低单步推理成本的优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Result: 在多样化的CVIT基准测试中，LiLoRA在顺序任务学习上表现优越，同时显著提高了参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为多模态增量学习提供了更高效且鲁棒的解决方案，克服了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 通过利用语言模态的特点，TRUST在解决复杂领域转移问题中表现出了卓越的性能，为领域适配开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their

negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

systems, suffer from inherent scalability and adaptability con straints,
particularly in complex environments. In this work, we propose
  an innovative localization framework that harnesses flooring characteris tics

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于多代理异步协作的犯罪行为预测框架（MA-CBP），通过融合短期与长期语境，为城市公共安全提供高效风险预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市化加速，公共场景中的犯罪行为对社会安全构成严重威胁，而传统异常检测方法和基于大语言模型的生成方法在捕获行为语义及实时性上存在不足。

Method: 设计了MA-CBP框架，利用实时视频流生成帧级语义描述，构建因果一致的历史总结，并结合邻近帧图像进行联合推理，分析行为语义。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多项数据集上表现优越，并提供了高质量犯罪行为数据集的多尺度语言监督。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市公共安全场景下的风险预警提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为WGAST的深度学习框架，用于通过时空融合Terra MODIS、Landsat 8和Sentinel-2卫星数据估算10米分辨率的每日地表温度（LST）。实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因城市化、气候变化和农业压力，精确并及时的环境监测需求日益增加。地表温度作为关键变量，其监测面临空间和时间分辨率的权衡，而现有方法对10米日分辨率LST的研究较少。

Method: 提出WGAST，一种弱监督生成网络，包含特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四阶段。通过条件生成对抗结构和PatchGAN鉴别器训练，采用余弦相似性、归一化和时间注意机制进行时空特征融合，并利用高斯滤波器抑制噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，WGAST相较基线方法平均减少RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%，对云引起的LST具有鲁棒性，并有效捕捉细尺度热模式。

Conclusion: WGAST是首个针对10米分辨率日LST估算的端到端深度学习框架，其优越性能和稳健性表明其可用于提升环境监测的精度和效率。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/WGAST.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DBIF-AUNet模型，通过改进双域特征解耦模块和分支交互注意力融合模块，解决了胸腔积液CT图像语义分割的多种挑战，显著提高了分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前胸腔积液CT图像语义分割存在灰度相似、边界模糊及形态变化等问题，传统方法在应对复杂边缘和图像多样性方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一种双分支交互融合注意力网络(DBIF-AUNet)，引入双域特征解耦模块(DDFD)和分支交互注意力融合模块(BIAF)，结合嵌套深度监督机制与自适应混合损失，实现多尺度特征补充和鲁棒性增强。

Result: 实验基于1622幅胸腔积液CT图像，DBIF-AUNet模型在IoU和Dice评分上分别达到80.1%和89.0%，较U-Net++和Swin-UNet分别提高5.7%/2.7%和2.2%/1.5%。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸腔积液CT图像的分割精度，优于当前最先进的医学图像分割模型，展示了其在临床应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家混合架构的通用异常检测框架——AnomalyMoE，能够检测多类型和多领域异常并达到当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测方法局限于特定领域或异常类型，普适性较差。

Method: 设计了基于专家混合架构的三层次异常检测网络，结合专家多样化模块和平衡模块，提升模型的普适性和性能。

Result: 在包括工业图像、3D点云、医学影像等八组数据集上的性能超过了专用方法，达到了最新的状态-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层次设计和模块改进，实现了异常检测领域的更高准确度和跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Motivation: 现有HOI数据集几乎只关注对象的使用功能，忽略了对象物理属性对长期人体运动的影响，因此需要更全面的研究数据集。

Method: 提出了PA-HOI运动捕捉数据集，记录了含有562个运动序列和35个3D对象的互动，分析了不同大小、形状和重量的对象如何影响人体运动特性。

Result: 数据集通过验证与现有运动生成方法相结合，证明了其在传递真实物理感知上的有效性，拓展了对人类运动与物体交互的理解。

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集为分析人-物体交互中的物理属性影响提供了重要依据，具有实用性和研究价值。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视觉任务中仍存局限，无法有效利用空间线索调整注意力焦点。

Method: 提出SIFThinker框架，结合深度增强框和自然语言生成图文链条，并通过GRPO-SIF强化训练，整合深度信息指导模型动态修正视觉焦点。

Result: SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度视觉感知方面超越了现有方法，同时表现出强大的通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker框架证明能够有效提升多模态模型在复杂视觉任务中的表现。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于RA严重程度指标（SvdH分数）的自动化预测算法，通过结合图像分析和机器学习方法实现高效、解释性强的诊断工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SvdH评分方法复杂且耗时，限制了其在临床常规中的应用。该研究因此旨在开发一种高效自动化的方法，以帮助预测RA病情严重程度。

Method: 研究团队设计了两阶段管道：第一阶段提取影像中与病变相关的区域，第二阶段通过基于注意力的多实例学习整合图像特征进行预测。提出了两种提取方法，包括切取包含异常的图像块和提取病变关节的影像区域。

Result: 最佳模型在Scheme 2下的预测表现为PCC达到0.943，RMSE为15.73；通过集成学习，进一步提升至PCC=0.945，RMSE=15.57，其性能达到与经验丰富的放射科医师相当的水平：PCC=0.97，RMSE=18.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅达到了先进的预测精度，还能有效聚焦病变关节，体现了临床相关性，有助于改进RA的诊断与监测流程。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

Conclusion: TEFormer通过结合纹理感知与边缘引导机制，有效提升城市遥感图像语义分割的准确性，并对复杂边界形态表现出较强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Conclusion: 利用类别专注的检测能力和时序引导的关键技术，GS-MoE框架在弱监督视频异常检测任务中树立了新标杆。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测算法在应对未知操纵技术时表现出弱泛化能力，研究旨在提高方法对不同操纵技术的鲁棒性。

Method: 该方法仅微调CLIP模型的Layer Normalization参数（占比0.03%），并通过L2正则化和潜在空间增强进行特征优化，从而提升模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在13个基准数据集上进行评估，LNCLIP-DF在跨数据集AUROC指标上超越了其他复杂的先进方法，表现出状态领先的性能。

Conclusion: 通过对CLIP模型进行针对性且最小化的调整，可以实现计算高效且具有强大泛化能力的深度伪造检测算法，同时揭示了泛化能力提升中的两个关键因素。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Method: FedX通过基于反向传播的解释方法评估模型组件的任务相关性，并剪枝不相关部分以减少模型尺寸，从而降低通信开销。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上，FedX显著降低了共享模型参数数量，同时相比未裁剪模型和先进的裁剪方法增强了全局模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX成功实现了在通信开销和模型性能之间的有效平衡，为联邦学习在遥感场景分类中的应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Method: 设计了XAG-Net模型，结合跨切片注意力（CSA）和跳跃式注意力门控（AG）机制，用以改进切片间上下文建模与切片内特征优化。

Result: 实验表明XAG-Net相比传统2D、2.5D、3D U-Net模型在分割精度和计算效率上具有明显优越性，CSA和AG模块的有效性也被消融实验验证。

Conclusion: XAG-Net提供了一种高效、准确解决股骨分割难题的新框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

*Aman Bhatta,Maria Dhakal,Michael C. King,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全新的方法，通过利用排名第一结果的额外注册图像来区分是否为库内或库外图像，并通过实验验证了方法在不同数据集和各种匹配器下的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在一对多面部识别中，确定排名第一的结果是否为库外仍是一大挑战，现有方法主要集中于为相似性分数设置阈值。

Method: 通过提取与排名第一身份相关的额外注册图像的排名，生成库内和库外的训练数据，并使用分类器预测排名第一的结果是否为库内或库外。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在处理不同质量的探测图像（如模糊、低分辨率等）以及跨不同人口群体的分类准确性方面表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效减少误报、错误逮捕和浪费的调查时间，并且其有效性依赖于使用高级基于边距损失函数训练的匹配器。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的无标签跨域视频时间定位方法，通过源域有标签训练，然后用少量目标域无标签视频进行调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在无标签目标域中的适应性差，以及全域适配带来的计算开销和部署困难。

Method: 提出一种不确定性量化的Rollout策略适配（URPA）方法，通过生成多个候选预测，平均形成伪标签，并用方差估计置信度，引导模型关注可靠的监督信号。

Result: 在三个数据集的六个跨域设置下，URPA方法表现出色，仅需少量无标签目标视频即可实现良好的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法以低计算和存储开销实现无标签领域下的视频时间定位，为实时部署提供了可能性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即使是受过训练的AI模型，在不同设备和协议生成的图像中往往表现较差，因此需要一种方法解决领域迁移问题。

Method: 提出使用扩散模型生成合成心脏核磁共振图像，确保与真实数据的空间和结构一致性，并兼容分割掩膜，用于训练和增强分割模型。

Result: 结果表明，该方法显著提高了在未见的数据领域上的分割性能（Surface-based metrics, p < 0.01）。

Conclusion: 扩散模型生成的合成数据在一定程度上解决了领域迁移问题，减少了对数据训练和迁移学习的需求，特别适用于数据稀缺的环境。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Result: 改进后的模型解决了从观测到符号状态的准确连接问题，并展示了无监督推断能力。

Conclusion: 新改进的ViPro模型在未提供初始全真状态的情况下表现优越，且更接近实际应用场景。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 采用街景图像和大规模语言模型，研究了城市街道的社会交往质量并与环境指标和城市场所依附感进行关联分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市规划定量研究多关注行人数量而非社会互动质量，该研究旨在利用全球覆盖的街景图像探索隐藏的社会信息。

Method: 通过分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像并结合Mehta社交分类法，使用线性回归模型测试了社交性测量值与城市场所依附感及环境指标的关系。

Result: 结果显示，天空视野与三种社交类型相关，绿色视野与持久性社交性相关，场所依附感与短暂性社交性正相关。

Conclusion: 研究初步证明街景图像可用来研究社会交往与环境变量关系，为隐私友好型、可扩展城市社会性研究工具提供可能性。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Motivation: 解决深度学习在医疗影像应用中，标注数据不足限制模型表现的问题。

Method: 采用以类条件图像翻译为核心的GAN模型，包括生成器、鉴别器、专用分类器，同时结合监督学习和无监督学习，提出了一种三阶段训练框架，并引入基于置信度加权和时间一致性的伪标签生成策略。

Result: 在MedMNIST上的实验表明，该方法优于六种最先进的GAN处理手段，尤其在5-shot标注样本场景下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为标注成本过高的医疗成像应用提供实用的解决方案，可在极少标注数据下实现鲁棒分类性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的视频理解多模态大语言模型在处理异常事件上表现不佳，主要由于异常事件的时空稀疏性和冗余信息的影响。

Method: 提出VA-GPT模型，通过Spatial Effective Token Selection（SETS）和Temporal Effective Token Generation（TETG）模块优化视觉编码器和大语言模型之间的关键信息对齐。同时，构建专门用于视频异常事件的指令数据集并引入跨领域评估基准。

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过改进异常事件的时空信息捕获与分析，实现了更准确的响应和互动，为视频异常事件的处理设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 旨在改进二维图像分割问题，分离图像的前景和背景区域，并提高分割效率。

Method: 通过将Chan-Vese模型改进为新的能量函数，并采用Split Bregman方法进行高效能量最小化，实现图像的两相分割。

Result: 算法在多幅图像上运行，并展示在不同参数设置下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的改进能有效实现二维图像的两相分割，验证了方法的适用性和性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模图像-文本数据集中，语义对齐松散（尤其是自动从网络收集的）或内容多样性低（如医疗数据集），阻碍了对比学习模型在多模态表示学习中的表现。

Method: 引入CLIPin插件，结合共享的预投影器，为图像和文本模态提供更强的监督，并结合对比与非对比学习，提升对齐性能。

Result: 实验表明，CLIPin插件在多种下游任务中表现优异，这种“即插即用”组件对多种对比框架均具兼容性。

Conclusion: CLIPin通过增强多模态语义对齐和鲁棒性，为现有CLIP模型提供了有效的改进和补充。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Motivation: 目前的多模态学习方法依赖大量模态特定的标注数据或只能处理单一模态，因此需探索无需模态标注的普适性模型。

Method: TaAM-CPT由模态提示池、文本构建和模态对齐的文本编码器组成，可通过添加提示池和文本编码器扩展新模态，设计了模态内和模态间学习目标以确保一致性。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Conclusion: FVGen克服了视频扩散模型采样速度慢的限制，显著提升了稀疏视图下的3D重建任务效率及效果。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical
assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language
models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to
combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the
radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating
text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The
publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form
descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, a high Dice
Score of 82% and low Hausdorff distance of 6.58 (pixels) was obtained for
lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-UMamba model outperformed prior
approaches: 37% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p <
0.001),and surpassed the purely image-based xLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by
1.74% and 0.22%, respectively. The dataset and code can be accessed at

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the
Major-to-minor (M2m) method M2m$_f$, M2m$_u$. The algorithms are tested on two
public datasets, OpenSARShip (6 classes) and FuSARShip (9 classes), using three
state-of-the-art models as feature extractors: ViT, VGG16, and ResNet50.
Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different
class sizes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel methods
over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Face swapping technology has gained significant attention in both academic
research and commercial applications. This paper presents our implementation
and enhancement of SimSwap, an efficient framework for high fidelity face
swapping. We introduce several improvements to the original model, including
the integration of self and cross-attention mechanisms in the generator
architecture, dynamic loss weighting, and cosine annealing learning rate
scheduling. These enhancements lead to significant improvements in identity
preservation, attribute consistency, and overall visual quality.
  Our experimental results, spanning 400,000 training iterations, demonstrate
progressive improvements in generator and discriminator performance. The
enhanced model achieves better identity similarity, lower FID scores, and
visibly superior qualitative results compared to the baseline. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of each architectural and training improvement. We
conclude by identifying key future directions, such as integrating StyleGAN3,
improving lip synchronization, incorporating 3D facial modeling, and
introducing temporal consistency for video-based applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D重光照生成模型无法充分利用主体的内在属性，且难以应对大规模多视图数据，导致效果欠佳。

Method: 提出一种名为Lightswitch的微调材质-重光照扩散框架，结合内在属性线索、多视图和材质信息，采用可扩展的去噪方案实现高效重光照。

Result: 在2D重光照预测质量上优于直接基于图像的现有最先进方法，并在合成和真实对象的重光照任务中匹敌或超越现有扩散反演渲染方法。

Conclusion: Lightswitch框架通过结合材质信息和多视图数据，提供了高效的高质量3D重光照解决方案，在2分钟内即可实现效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

Conclusion: FineDialFact为对话事实验证提供了基准，为未来研究指明方向，其数据集和代码将公开，为社区进一步探索提供支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

TL;DR: 研究探讨记忆限制对语言学习的贡献，特别是在Transformer模型中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类记忆的短暂性如何有助于语言学习以及这种机制在现代语言模型（如Transformers）中的表现。

Method: 通过对比实验，分别训练具有和不具有短暂记忆的Transformer模型，并在开发性数据集上进行语言建模和句法评估。

Result: 短暂记忆提高了语言学习效果，但却降低了对人类阅读时间的预测能力，这种现象无法用现有理论解释。

Conclusion: 记忆限制确实有助于神经语言模型学习，但对预测人类行为的作用有限。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

### [103] ["Mirror" Language AI Models of Depression are Criterion-Contaminated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05830)
*Tong Li,Rasiq Hussain,Mehak Gupta,Joshua R. Oltmanns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究对比了“镜像模型”和“非镜像模型”在人类语言下抑郁评分预测能力，发现镜像模型会因准则污染导致效应量虚高且泛化能力差。而非镜像模型效应量较小但更真实可靠，可能在心理评估中具有独特价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多基于LLM的语言模型用于抑郁评分预测，但其中一些方法因准则污染缺乏泛化能力，因此研究与开发更普适性模型的方法显得尤为重要。

Method: 通过让GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B从两种不同访谈录制中（结构化诊断访谈和生活史访谈）预测抑郁评分，并比较“镜像”与“非镜像模型”的效能差异。

Result: 镜像模型在效应量上表现出大幅提升（如R2 = .80），但存在偏倚。非镜像模型效应量较低但与真实症状相关性表现一致（如r = ~.54）。

Conclusion: 镜像模型因准则污染表现出虚高结果，且泛化能力差。非镜像模型能更好反映真实语义特征或在实际心理评估中更有可用性。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

TL;DR: 研究探讨深度神经网络支持的代理之间的突现通信，并通过限制小词汇量和模拟自然语言的屈折变化来重新设计实验场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于突现通信的研究更多关注于特定领域的目标与指标，而这些指标强调了独特字符的一对一表达与语法组合作用。本文希望通过模拟自然语言中的屈折变化等特点重新诠释并拓展这些研究。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的实验设置，将小词汇限制引入现有的属性-值重建游戏，并模拟自然语言的屈折形态，同时开发新的评估指标以理解深度神经网络支持的语言属性特点。

Result: 实验表明，模拟的语音学限制促进了拼接形态的出现，而实验中突现的语言也复制了自然语言融合语法属性的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了受约束的神经网络模型能够部分地模拟自然语言的拼接性和屈折融合特性，对深入理解人类语言的本质提供了参考。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs在认知情绪维度的推理上具有潜力，其内部情绪表示可以通过认知评价维度进行解读；所提出的CoRE基准工具促进了进一步研究。

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Result: 在五个QA基准和四个开源LLM上进行了实验，结果显示SPS和xCompress能显著提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过SPS和xCompress，作者为检索和生成的交互提供了新的视角，并说明了其对RAG研究的推动意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

Motivation: 亲社会性内容检测对于信任和安全系统越来越重要，但其定义和标注数据尚未完善，需开发新的方法。

Method: 提出一个三阶段管道，包括基于LLM的标注策略选择、人机优化循环，以及两阶段分类架构设计。

Result: 通过使用该方法，实现了高质量标注和高精度分类，同时显著降低了推理成本达70%。

Conclusion: 该管道展示了通过人机交互、任务优化及架构设计，可实现亲社会性检测的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评分方法忽略了作文主题的特定特征，无法有效评估主题一致性。

Method: 通过引入话题感知型提示调优(ATOP)，结合对抗训练和邻居分类的方法，设计了能够同时学习主题分享特征和专题特定特征的框架。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上，ATOP在整体及多特性评分上明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP方法通过有效的特征提取与对抗式训练，明显提升了跨主题作文评分的效果，为未来相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种语言模型架构，通过自身评估和动态改进生成能力，解决偏好学习缺陷并取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我奖励范式在选择和拒绝响应的同步改进中存在代表性差异缩小的问题，影响有效的偏好学习。

Method: 引入双阶段框架，固定拒绝响应（锚定拒绝）和动态优化选择响应（未来引导选择），协调模型生成过程以维持学习信号。

Result: 在三个模型家族和多个模型尺寸的实验中，该方法显著优于自我奖励基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0中提高了9.75个百分点。

Conclusion: 提出的时间自我奖励语言模型方法不仅在相似资源下有较高性能，还展示了在数学推理、知识问答和代码生成等任务中的较强泛化性。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在探查LLMs知识表示时计算成本较高且耗时，因此需要一种高效的方法检测大语言模型的知识表达和不足。

Method: 通过构建PEEK方法，利用LLMs的已知事实训练嵌入模型，并使用线性解码层预测LLMs的知识。

Result: 在3个Wikipedia数据集、4个LLMs和7个嵌入模型上进行评估，验证嵌入模型预测LLMs知识具有90%的准确率，发现句子嵌入模型比图嵌入模型更优。

Conclusion: 知识适应型嵌入可有效检测LLMs知识缺口，并提供对其内在知识表达的深入理解，具有实际推广意义和应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对故事评价任务的新框架EvolvR，通过自我生成和自我筛选高质量推理数据，提升评估模型的性能和故事生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在开放性任务如故事评价上的表现有限，尤其是缺乏适应性或严谨推理能力，亟需一种高效的框架解决这些问题。

Method: 提出自我进化的成对推理框架（EvolvR），通过多角色策略生成链式推理数据（CoT），结合多代理自我筛选机制确保数据质量，最终利用优化后的数据训练的评估器指导故事生成。

Result: EvolvR在StoryER、HANNA和OpenMEVA等三个基准测试中取得了SOTA性能，并显著提升了生成故事的质量。

Conclusion: 该框架的自我进化策略在提升故事评价和生成任务上的性能方面表现出显著优势，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played
diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile,
large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text,
images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs
without human linguistic expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GraphRAG方法中预构建图带来的高开销和更新延迟问题，同时应对不同查询类型与逻辑结构需求的不匹配。

Method: 提出一种名为LogicRAG的框架，通过推断时动态分解和建图，采用DAG建模逻辑依赖，并通过拓扑排序进行逻辑一致的多步推理，同时通过图修剪与上下文修剪优化检索效率。

Result: 通过大量实验表明，LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于最新的基线方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG框架无需预建图，能够动态适应查询逻辑，显著减少检索成本并提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有安全解决方案在检测和干预关键推理步骤时缺乏足够的细致性和主动性，无法有效解决操作性安全风险问题。

Method: 引入AURA框架，结合自省性自我批评、细粒度过程奖励模型（PRM）评估及自适应安全解码机制，动态指导模型走向更安全的推理路径。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著优于现有技术，大幅提高了模型输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: 本文研究为实现更安全、更负责任、且具有情境感知能力的AI技术奠定了基础，设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法忽略了训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性的重要性，这限制了蒸馏效果。

Method: 设计了SRD框架，通过比较学生模型输出与真实数据，动态评估和选择高质量、兼容的训练实例；此外，还采用课程调度策略逐步引入这些实例到蒸馏过程中。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性是知识蒸馏成效的关键。SRD框架能够在不修改底层算法的情况下，显著提升样本效率和压缩后模型的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

Motivation: 目前的稀疏化方法使用统一的稀疏率，忽略了模型参数的结构和统计异质性，导致关键参数被误剪或无用参数被保留的问题。

Method: 提出TADrop策略，根据参数张量的分布特性分配不同的稀疏率，对冗余多的张量进行更多剪枝，而对稀疏关键的张量则减少剪枝，这种方式与多种合并方法集成验证。

Result: 在多个任务和模型上的实验表明，TADrop能显著提升模型性能，例如在8个ViT-B/32任务中平均提升2.0%。

Conclusion: 通过优化参数稀疏化，TADrop为高性能模型合并设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

Method: 提出“统一检索与推理”（UR2）框架，通过难度感知的训练动态调用检索，并结合特定领域离线语料库与模型生成摘要的混合知识访问策略。

Result: UR2在多个任务上显著超越现有的RAG和RL方法，与GPT-4系列模型达到相当性能。

Conclusion: UR2通过统一检索和推理，展示了多任务、多领域的适应性和高性能，释放了RAG-RL方法在广泛领域的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

Conclusion: 语用学理论必须扩展，以适应生成式AI模型的独特交际方式及语境需求，推动更有效的跨人机交流。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了高效注入少量数据到LLMs中，同时避免灾难性遗忘的问题，现有方法存在数据需求量大或适应性差的挑战。

Method: 使用无交集的新闻数据集，通过生成多样化文本变体的方式，探索知识注入与保持之间的平衡。结合对RAG方法和参数化方法的对比，并尝试模型自生成数据以提升学习效果。

Result: 实验表明，简单的持续预训练效果有限，采用多样化文本变体显著提升了新知识学习效果。RAG法对注入数据较敏感，容易引发退化。而模型自生成合成数据在更新中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DKG-LLM框架，通过动态知识图谱和大型语言模型结合，对医疗诊断和个性化治疗提供革命性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在利用语言模型和动态知识图谱的结合，为医疗领域提供更精准、高效的诊断和治疗建议。

Method: 使用动态知识图谱结合Grok 3大型语言模型，引入自适应语义融合算法（ASFA），基于异构数据（如临床报告、PubMed文章等）动态生成知识图谱，并结合概率模型和贝叶斯推断进行优化。

Result: DKG-LLM在真实世界数据集上的诊断准确率达到84.19%，治疗推荐准确率为89.63%，语义覆盖率为93.48%。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM框架在处理噪声数据及复杂疾病方面表现出色，是具有广泛应用潜力的变革性工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

*Lai Jiang,Yuekang Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Youtao Ding,Li Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了一种场景自适应的多维评估框架和完整的数据集，用于精确评估LLM的jailbreak，实验结果表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的jailbreak评估方法多为二元分类，缺乏对危害强度的量化，多维框架在场景应用上存在局限性。

Method: 提出SceneJailEval，一个场景自适应的多维评估框架，以及一个含有14种场景的数据集，提升评估的精确性与灵活性。

Result: SceneJailEval在全场景数据集上的F1分数为0.917（较现有SOTA提升6%），在JBB上的F1分数为0.995（较现有SOTA提升3%）。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval通过场景适应性、多维度评估方法及高质量数据集显著提升了jailbreak评估的精度与全面性。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的情绪智能（EI）四层分类法，并设计了EICAP-Bench基准测试以评估其EI能力。此外，通过对Qwen2.5模型进行微调，仅发现Appraisal层有所提升，指出现有训练方法在情绪推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补当前LLMs在情绪智能方面的研究空白，提出心理学导向的分类法以更好地对LLMs进行EI能力评估和训练。

Method: 建立了情绪智能四层分类（情绪追踪、原因推断、评估及情绪适配）并设计了EICAP-Bench多轮选择题形式的基准测试，同时通过LoRA微调技术增强模型的情绪智能能力评估。

Result: 对六个LLMs模型的测试显示Qwen2.5-Instruct表现最佳；进一步微调后发现，仅Appraisal层在统计上显著提升，表明现有方法对EI提升的有限效果。

Conclusion: EI能力需要更有针对性的训练数据和建模策略才能实现全面对齐，现有预训练和Instruction-tuning方法在深层次情绪推理方面存在明显不足。

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

*Richard Willats,Josh Pennington,Aravind Mohan,Bertie Vidgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用基于检索增强生成（RAG）的分类方法，用于内容审核，能动态适应政策变化，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类系统难以快速适应内容审核政策变化，因此需要一种能够动态调整的分类模型。

Method: 引入基于RAG的上下文政策引擎（CPE），通过结合检索的上下文知识，将分类任务转化为基于政策的内容评估。

Result: 该系统在三个实验中表现出强大的基准性能，能够精准调整保护特定群体的政策细节，无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: RAG方法能够使分类变得更加灵活、透明和适应性强，为内容审核和更广泛的分类问题提供新方向。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了InfoCausalQA，一个评估多模态因果推理能力的新基准，结果显示当前的视觉语言模型在因果推理方面表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型尚未在因果推理方面深入探索，尤其是在多模态场景下。

Method: 引入InfoCausalQA基准，包括基于量化因果与语义因果两类任务，构建数据集并利用GPT-4o生成高质量多选题，经人工校正保证题目真实有效。

Result: 实验表明现有模型在计算与语义因果推理上的性能有限，与人类表现相比存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该研究突出了提升多模态AI因果推理能力的紧迫性和必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

*Theresa Pekarek Rosin,Burak Can Kaplan,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究针对现有语音意图识别（IR）方法主要限于短指令且过于聚焦英语的问题，提出了针对老年德国人语音的全新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流的语音意图识别技术主要支持短语、并且以英语为主，难以满足老年非英语群体的需求，因此需要设计适应老年德国语音的IR方法。

Method: 使用经改造后的Whisper语音识别模型与基于Transformer的语言模型相结合，通过生成三个LLM（LeoLM, Llama3, ChatGPT）的合成数据训练模型，并进行跨数据集测试验证。

Result: 实验表明，使用生成的合成语言数据显著提升了分类性能和对不同说话风格及新词汇的鲁棒性。而小型领域特定的LeoLM比更大的ChatGPT表现更优秀。

Conclusion: 以生成式AI填补低资源领域数据缺口，展示了有效性。数据生成和训练过程提供了详细记录以确保透明性和可复现性。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

*Ruichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种名为Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR)的方法，旨在检测大语言模型（LLMs）中的剽窃行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于检测LLM剽窃的现有方法在准确性和统计推断上存在不足，而剽窃对原始开发者造成严重损害。

Method: 利用矩阵分析和大偏差理论的MDIR方法，可精确重建权重对应关系，提供严格的统计显著性度量，并专注于权重相似性，无需完整的模型推理。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR能在受到广泛变化（如随机置换和大量数据持续预训练）后，依然可靠地检测剽窃行为，且可在单台PC上于一小时内完成检测。

Conclusion: MDIR高效、准确且易用，在大语言模型剽窃检测中具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为DynamicTRF的框架，通过引入Graph Response Efficiency (GRE)指标和生成问题特定的TRF偏好数据集，以改进大规模多模态模型（LMMs）在图问答任务中的准确性和回答简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模多模态模型在处理图问答时多采用单一拓扑形式表示（TRF），难以根据任务或模型的需求生成最优的回答，导致结果不准确或冗长。

Method: 设计了一组针对零样本图问答的TRF形式集$F_{ZS}$，提出Graph Response Efficiency (GRE)指标以衡量问答性能与简洁性之间的平衡；创建TRF偏好数据集(TRFP)并训练TRF路由器，根据问题动态选择最优的TRF。

Result: 在7个领域内算法图问答任务以及2个跨领域任务上的实验表明，DynamicTRF框架显著提高了LMMs在图问答中的准确性。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过任务自适应的TRF选择，与传统单一TRF方法相比，不仅提升了问答的精确度，还显著改善了回答的简洁性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

Motivation: 针对网络欺凌检测中的复杂表达问题，研究探讨如何通过融合攻击性检测改善大模型的一般化能力和表现。

Method: 实验包括五个攻击性数据集和一个网络欺凌数据集，采用多种策略进行：零样本、少样本、LoRA独立微调、多任务学习及提议的增强提示流水线方法。

Result: 增强提示流水线方法表现优于传统的LoRA微调方法，说明攻击性相关语境对网络欺凌检测的提升作用。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用如攻击性检测的辅助任务，有助于提升大模型在社交网络中以安全为目的任务的表现。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

in low-resource author style personalized text generation space. Through this
work, we question the effectiveness of the widely adopted evaluation metrics
like BLEU and ROUGE, and explore other evaluation paradigms such as style

text generation task. We evaluate these metrics and their ensembles using our
style discrimination benchmark, that spans eight writing tasks, and evaluates
across three settings, domain discrimination, authorship attribution, and LLM
personalized vs non-personalized discrimination. We provide conclusive evidence
to adopt ensemble of diverse evaluation metrics to effectively evaluate style
personalized text generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ChatAnime的全新数据集，用于研究大语言模型（LLMs）在情感支持角色扮演（ESRP）中的性能，数据集包含2400条人工生成和24000条LLM生成的对话，实验表明顶级LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持方面表现优于人类爱好者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究将情感支持与角色扮演能力结合起来，以实现与虚拟角色的情感互动，为此选择了动漫角色作为案例研究对象。

Method: 设计了ChatAnime数据集，选取20位顶级动漫角色，创建60个情感场景问题，招募40名角色扮演专家收集对话数据，并设计了基于用户体验的评价体系，结合人工和机器生成的数据进行比较性实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，顶级LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持方面优于人类参与者，但在人类用户生成的响应多样性方面仍表现不足。

Conclusion: ChatAnime为研究优化LLMs在情感支持和角色扮演中的表现提供了有价值的资源和启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at
https://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SecMCP框架，通过检测和量化对话偏移来强化大语言模型的安全性，有效应对工具中毒和提示注入等安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Model Context Protocol（MCP）在引入外部工具时带来的安全和隐私风险，尤其是对抗性内容导致的工具中毒和间接提示注入。

Method: 通过建模LLM的激活向量并基于多面体空间检测对话动态中的异常偏移，SecMCP能够量化和检测外部知识引发的偏离。

Result: 在使用Llama3、Vicuna和Mistral等模型以及MS MARCO、HotpotQA、FinQA等数据集的实验中，SecMCP实现了超过0.915的AUROC分数，同时保持系统可用性。

Conclusion: SecMCP展示了其在检测对话劫持、误导和数据泄露方面的有效性，并为MCP安全威胁提供了系统分类和量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

Conclusion: 程序性记忆可以显著增强智能体的适应性和效率，具备跨模型迁移的潜力，为未来智能体设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

### [137] [Learning the Topic, Not the Language: How LLMs Classify Online Immigration Discourse Across Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06435)
*Andrea Nasuto,Stefano Maria Iacus,Francisco Rowe,Devika Jain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在少量语言微调情况下的跨语言迁移能力，尤其在移民相关推文分类中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在少量微调后是否能够实现语言间的知识迁移，以及通过添加目标语言修正预训练偏差。

Method: 使用轻量级LLaMA 3.2-3B模型，对13种语言的移民相关推文进行单语、双语和多语数据的微调与分类实验。

Result: 研究表明，用少量语言微调的LLMs可以可靠分类未见语言的移民相关内容，但对立场的分类需多语微调；细微语言接触即可显著改进表现，纠正预训练偏差。

Conclusion: 跨语言掌握不需要广泛的多语训练，少量微调足以实现主题级泛化，且通过轻量干预可纠正模型结构性偏差。此外，提供了开源量化模型，可更经济高效地使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

TL;DR: 本文研究生成式人工智能（GenAI）对新闻的影响，发现近年来GenAI的使用显著增加，尤其是在地方和大学新闻中。GenAI提高了文章可读性但降低了形式感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式人工智能（如LLMs）在新闻内容上的应用及其对新闻完整性和原创性的影响。

Method: 使用三种高级AI文本检测器（如Binoculars、Fast-Detect GPT和GPTZero），分析超过40,000篇来自不同新闻媒体的新闻文章。并通过句子层级和语言层级进行深入分析。

Result: 发现GenAI的应用在近年来快速增长，特别是在地方和大学新闻中；其主要用于文章的引言部分，而结论部分往往是手动撰写；此外语言分析表明，GenAI能够提高文本的词汇丰富性和可读性，但降低了形式感，使得写作风格更趋统一。

Conclusion: GenAI的使用已经在新闻领域体现，并影响了新闻质量和形式，需要进一步关注。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns
for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated
content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news
media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SlimInfer，用于通过逐层精细化修剪LLM的中间层隐藏状态中的冗余token以加速推理，同时大幅减少内存和I/O需求，实验显著提高TTFT和整体延迟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型推理中因长上下文导致的高计算需求问题，提出直接优化中间过程隐藏状态以提高效率。

Method: 设计了一种动态精细化的逐层剪枝机制，基于信息扩散现象修剪隐藏状态中的冗余tokens，结合异步KV缓存管理以减少内存和I/O消耗。

Result: 在LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct模型上，实现了高达2.53倍的首字延迟时间提速和1.88倍的总体延迟降低，同时在LongBench性能上保持与原始模型一致。

Conclusion: SlimInfer通过引入创新性层间token修剪和缓存管理方法，证明了在保证模型性能的前提下可显著提高推理效率。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了“HapticLLaMA”，一种可将触觉振动信号转化为自然语言描述的多模态感知语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往多模态研究主要集中于视觉和音频，但触觉信号的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，正式提出触觉字幕生成任务。

Method: 提出两种触觉标记器（基于频率和EnCodec），结合LLaMA模型进行训练，包括LoRA微调和基于人类反馈的强化学习微调（RLHF）。

Result: “HapticLLaMA”在触觉振动信号的解读表现优异，获取了METEOR评分59.98与BLEU-4评分32.06。超61%的生成字幕获得高于3.5分的人类评分。

Conclusion: HapticLLaMA展现出处理和适应感官数据的能力，为触觉信号在虚拟现实等领域的应用提供新可能性。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM在多轮交互中形成临时约定的能力，使其在模拟人类动态交流上更高效。

Method: 通过针对性微调，使LLM在包含临时约定形成的示例数据上进行后训练；设计两个基准进行评估：一个是以认知为动机的交互基准，另一个是基于文档参考完成的任务。

Result: 后训练的LLM在多轮交互下，展示出显著增强的约定形成能力，优于原模型。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练能够有效改善LLM的动态适应性与约定形成表现，提升其在交互环境下的实际效用。

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by
adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work
shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training
process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的出现，人们开始探索它们在纯视觉输入的用户界面中操作的潜力。然而，模型在自然语言指令的空间和语义对齐方面面临挑战，尤其是后者。

Method: 通过自适应探索奖励（AER）函数和多答案生成策略来引导广泛探索，从而优化模型的语义对齐能力，并训练InfiGUI-G1-3B和InfiGUI-G1-7B两种模型。

Result: 在多个挑战性的GUI语义对齐基准测试中，AEPO训练的模型实现了显著的相对改进，最高提升至9.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO方法有效解决了探索效率不足的问题，并为进一步研究GUI语义对齐提供了新思路，同时资源已开源以便拓展。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法存在局限性，因此需要一个在系统设计核心整合安全保证的新方法。

Method: 通过透明的信念表示和分层价值对齐，结合自然语言处理和主动推理原则实现一个多代理系统，以确保安全性。

Result: 框架详细设计了几种安全机制，包括自然语言表达信念和偏好、通过资源感知的自由能最小化实现有限理性，以及通过模块化代理结构实现组合安全性。

Conclusion: 新框架提供了一种从核心上促进AGI安全发展的方法，并提出基于ARC基准的实验以验证框架的安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Conclusion: 文章提议重新审视符号性的基础，并制定新的研究计划以探索符号系统与人类思维的关联。

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

TL;DR: 当前的可解释AI主要为开发者服务，偏重于为模型输出提供正当性而非支持不同利益相关者的需求。Holistic-XAI提出了一种统一框架，将因果评价方法与传统XAI相结合，为可解释性提供交互式、多方法的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的XAI方法局限于单一用户群体（开发者）和单一需求（模型输出正当性），无法满足不同利益相关者对模型解释的多样化需求。

Method: 提出了Holistic-XAI，整合因果评价与传统XAI技术，通过交互式、多方法的方式支持利益相关者提问、验证假设并进行模型行为比较，同时适用于实例级和全局级的解释需求。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（信用风险分类和金融时间序列预测）验证了H-XAI框架的通用性，展示了其在不同场景和需求下的适用性。

Conclusion: Holistic-XAI利用因果评分与后验解释相结合的方式，针对个体决策和整体模型两方面，填补现有XAI方法的关键空白，支持利益相关者的特定问题解答。

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the
development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention,
particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to
perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a
specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied
navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety
and increasing industrial efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具检索方法主要依赖用户查询和工具说明之间的相似性，但在多步用户请求上表现受限，因此需要提升检索精度。

Method: 构建基于知识图谱的工具检索框架，通过1-hop自我工具图建模工具间的直接和间接连接，改进工具选择的全面性和上下文适配性。

Result: 在内生成数据集上的评估显示，提出方法在Complete Recall微平均覆盖率达91.85%，显著优于最强非知识图谱基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的结构信息对提升工具检索，特别是顺序工具选择任务中的表现，提供了显著支持。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLMs在合作流程中不稳定，自我反思能力较弱，不适合复杂医学决策。

Method: 设计MedOrch框架，将LLM作为调控剂，协调多个VLM专家进行输出交流和反思，无需额外模型训练。

Result: 在五个医学视觉问答基准上验证，MedOrch的协作表现优于单个VLM表现。

Conclusion: 通过调解器指导的多代理协作框架，可推动医疗多模态智能发展，且表现优异无需高成本模型。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出一种分层多智能体框架（HIMA），通过模仿学习和元控制器解决长时间动态任务的局限性，在StarCraftII上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在动态和长时间任务（如实时战略游戏StarCraftII）中表现有限，难以应对资源管理和部分观测环境等挑战。

Method: 提出HIMA框架，包括策略规划器（SP）和模仿学习的专用智能体模块。每个专用智能体通过专家演示学习特定策略，SP将这些建议整合为适应环境的整体计划。

Result: 实验证明HIMA在StarCraftII上的战略清晰性、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合模仿学习模块与元级控制的方式，可以开发出更加健壮且通用的人工智能智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

TL;DR: 研究探索了大语言模型在复杂决策资源分配任务中的能力，并提出一个双重目的框架，结合了参与式预算进行资源分配及评估推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有基准的静态特性以及数据污染问题，研究动机是为了更好地理解和评估大语言模型在复杂决策场景中的推理能力。

Method: 通过参与式预算设置任务，测试三种提示策略（贪婪选择、直接优化和类似爬山法的细化方法），并用一个效用最大化的oracle作为基准。同时评估模型从自然语言或元数据中推导偏好的能力。

Result: 结果显示提示设计的关键作用，表明大语言模型对于带有非结构化输入的机制设计任务具有潜力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了参与式预算框架的有效性以及大语言模型在推测偏好和决策任务中的潜在优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了“认知想象”这一概念，认为其在AI中的重要性仍被低估，并建议使用语义模型进行模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为当前人工智能缺乏对认知想象的重视，这限制了其推理能力和语义验证能力，导致一些问题。

Method: 提出使用语义模型，这是一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，可学习且支持对语义上下文进行整体操作。

Result: 语义模型能够模拟认知想象，提供一致和可操作的语义上下文。

Conclusion: 加强对认知想象的关注，并通过语义模型推进AI领域的发展。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化决策树的算法在实时性能上表现不佳，缺乏在部分搜索空间中快速找到高质量解的能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的通用框架CA-DL8.5，该框架基于DL8.5框架并结合重启式束搜索，通过模块化设计允许集成多种启发式和放宽机制，同时保留分支限界裁剪和缓存优化。

Result: 实验表明，CA-DL8.5在使用基于LDS的启发式策略时始终具备最佳实时性能，优于其他变体及Blossom算法，同时仍保持完整性和最优性。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5框架统一了现有的实时算法策略，具有更高的灵活性和效率，为优化决策树学习提供了新的范式选择。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在感知复杂环境和实时决策方面面临着重大挑战：传统模块化方法存在错误传播和协调问题，而端到端学习模型虽然简化设计，但面临计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种结合鸟瞰图(BEV)感知的深度强化学习方法，设计了高效的Mamba-BEV网络用于时空特征提取，并基于此提出ME$^3$-BEV框架，实现动态城市驾驶场景中的端到端深度强化学习。

Result: 在CARLA仿真中，ME$^3$-BEV在碰撞率、轨迹精确性等指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了自动驾驶系统的实时决策和解释能力，为动态城市驾驶环境提供了一种有潜力的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Motivation: 解决Barceló等提出的开放性问题，探究GNN逻辑表达能力与C2逻辑的关系。

Method: 通过理论证明，比较aggregate-combine-readout GNNs和C2逻辑的表达能力。

Result: 证明Aggregate-combine-readout GNNs的逻辑表达能力严格超过C2逻辑，不论是有向还是无向图。

Conclusion: 此研究不仅解决了GNN逻辑表达能力的关键问题，还为无限逻辑表达能力提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为PanelTR的框架，通过结构化的科学方法促进LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现，在零样本条件下优于基础LLMs，且可与传统监督模型媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格推理任务需要依赖标注数据或复杂的数据增强，而LLMs尽管具备多功能性，但表现往往不及简单的监督模型，灵活性和泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出了PanelTR框架，利用具备科学家角色的LLM智能体，通过单独调查、自我审查和协作式同行评审等步骤完成科学方法论的表格推理任务，避免了对数据增强和参数优化的依赖。

Result: PanelTR在四个基准测试中超越了通用LLMs的表现，达到了与完全监督模型相当的水平，同时实现了独立于训练数据的推理能力。

Conclusion: 采用结构化的科学方法能够有效应对包括表格推理在内的复杂任务，并在零样本情境下展现出灵活的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SKATE框架，通过让大型语言模型(LLMs)相互生成和解决可验证任务进行能力评估，其特点是完全自动化、数据无依赖且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的评估方法需要高度领域知识，导致无法跟上模型快速发展的步伐，急需一种通用、可扩展的方法。

Method: SKATE将评估视为竞赛：模型充当任务制定者和解答者，目的是创造能够凸显自身优势并揭示对手弱点的问题。通过使用可验证任务进行客观评分，并通过TrueSkill系统对模型能力进行排名。

Result: 实验表明：较弱模型可以可靠地区分和评分更强模型；LLMs具有自我偏好行为；SKATE可自动揭示模型之间的细粒度能力差异。

Conclusion: SKATE框架是通用、可扩展的评估方法的一项重要进展，有望跟上LLMs的快速发展。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

Motivation: 传统的VRP元启发式算法设计主要依赖人工经验，但机器学习方法可以通过结构特性帮助设计更高效的算法。本研究旨在扩展这种方法，深入探讨特征对预测解质量的影响。

Result: 研究发现某些特征在不同场景下始终表现为强预测指标，并提出了一个用于跨场景特征影响力排序的框架。

Conclusion: 特征重要性分析具有作为元启发式算法解决VRP指导机制的潜力。

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

Method: 利用OpenAI的GPT-4o-mini作为基础模型，结合text-embedding-3-small模型进行嵌入，引入Langchain管理混合检索系统，并使用药物利用审查公共数据库的数据。

Result: RAG框架的引入使模型在不同禁忌症类别中的准确性从0.49-0.57提高到0.94、0.87和0.89。

Conclusion: 将大语言模型与RAG框架整合，可显著提升医疗领域特别是药物禁忌症相关决策的精确性与可靠性。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Conclusion: 通过引入 TH-Score 和 LLM-as-a-Fuser 框架，研究破解了当前模型因过置信引发的可靠性问题，实现更可靠和风险可控的裁判系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的基准测试忽略了辅助线构建，且缺乏流程评估，因此无法全面评估MLLM的长步骤推理能力。

Method: 设计了GeoLaux基准、包括五维度评估策略（答案正确性、过程正确性、过程质量、辅助线影响、错误原因），用于测试13种领先的MLLM模型。

Result: 模型在多步骤推理和辅助线构建能力方面表现出显著不足，且在证明问题中更倾向于寻找捷径。

Conclusion: GeoLaux成为评估MLLM几何推理能力的重要工具，并为增强这种能力提供了实际指导。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡模型复杂性与数据拟合方面表现出色，为实现高效、稳定的学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general
programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on
several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

TL;DR: 这是关于归纳逻辑编程中通过打破假设空间对称性来加速假设搜索的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 归纳逻辑编程中存在搜索巨大的假设空间的挑战，尤其是由于存在许多逻辑等价的假设。

Method: 提出了一种在假设空间中打破对称性的方法，并将其用在回答集编程中。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个领域显著缩短了求解时间，从一小时以上减少到17秒。

Conclusion: 通过打破假设空间中的对称性，可以有效提高归纳逻辑编程搜索效率。

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that
generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching
vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent
hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break
symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set
programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning
and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an
hour to just 17 seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解当前最先进的大语言模型（LLM）的鲁棒性及漏洞分布，并提供更精细化的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种动态对抗优化系统BET，进行自动化漏洞测试，并结合更细颗粒度的鲁棒性度量与原语级别的漏洞分析。

Result: BET成功攻击了41个先进LLM模型中的37个，揭示模型在鲁棒性上的显著差异，同时找出了针对不同危害类别的最佳绕过技术。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管LLM普遍存在漏洞，但各个模型的表现差异明显，并提出协作式评估可能是未来改进的有效路径。

Abstract: This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by
PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior
Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through
Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we
propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of
attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty
varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We
introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

### [166] [A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326)
*Nathaniel Virgo,Martin Biehl,Manuel Baltieri,Matteo Capucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新解读了Conant和Ashby的经典理论，提出无论系统是如何进行调节，都可以解释为它对环境进行“信念更新”，从而具备模型特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典理论认为优秀的系统调节者必须是系统的模型，但这一点似乎不适用于某些无明确模型的调节系统，需重新审视这一理论。

Method: 通过定义更复杂的“信念更新”模型，赋予观察者在理论中的核心作用，阐述模型并非系统自有，而是由外部施加的。

Result: 提出的定理可广泛适用于不同的系统调节场景，无论是环境调节还是自身状态调节，且解释了先前的“反例”。

Conclusion: 模型的存在与否取决于外部观察者的视角，该理论更具适应性且拓展了解释范围。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Motivation: 当前反作弊系统在应对不断演变的作弊方法时面临挑战，本文旨在提供一种非侵入式、数据驱动的作弊检测方法。

Method: 提出使用Transformer模型AntiCheatPT_256，并引入CS2CD数据集来训练和评估该模型。数据集包含795场比赛的数据，通过数据增强处理类不平衡问题，生成90,707个上下文窗口用于训练。

Result: 模型在未增强的测试集上取得了89.17%的准确率和93.36%的AUC，表明其在作弊检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: AntiCheatPT_256为基于数据驱动的作弊检测提供了一个强大的基线，具有现实应用的潜力，同时促进了未来相关研究的可复现性。

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

TL;DR: 文章介绍了生成式AI在解释型AI中的应用，从用户理解角度提供个性化、情境化的解释，并验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI注重算法透明性，未能有效支持用户理解。

Method: 通过生成式AI提出解释型AI概念，开发八维概念模型，并采用快速情景设计方法验证。

Result: 验证显示用户更倾向于情境敏感、多模态的解释。

Conclusion: 为AI设计提供面向用户理解的研究方向，超越技术透明性。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种自动化法律知识图谱(KG)构建的方法以解决当前该领域中KG稀缺的问题，并以针对女性暴力案件的案例测试其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法律决策流程复杂且需要大量背景知识，法律知识图谱能够显著提升信息访问和决策支持能力，但在法律领域的应用尚少。

Method: 提出了两种互补性的KG自动化构建方法：一种基于法律领域定制的系统性自下而上方法，另一种利用大语言模型的新方法，从欧洲法院公开案例中提取数据，进行本体开发和语义增强。

Result: 比较了两种方法的构建效果，通过能力问题验证了所开发KG的质量与实用性。

Conclusion: 开发的KG能显著改善法律信息获取，支持复杂查询，并可作为预测司法的机器学习工具的重要知识组件。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 概述一种名为“公平游戏”的动态机制，通过将审计员和去偏算法结合到一个循环中，利用强化学习动态调整机器学习算法的预测，旨在实现更适合社会动态变化的公平机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的公平机器学习算法在动态社会环境中难以充分适应，因为它们通常基于观察性的偏差定义，这些定义在现实中可能存在冲突且很大程度依赖于已知的真值或后验的部署数据，从而与实际需求之间存在差距。

Method: 提出了一种名为“公平游戏”的框架，将审计员（负责识别偏差）和去偏算法结合，并通过强化学习使两者在机器学习算法预测过程中实现动态互动和反馈调整。

Result: 该机制能够通过强化学习及时调整和适应偏差，并模拟社会伦理与法律框架的演变，提供了一种灵活且自动适应时间变化的公平机器学习系统的构建方法。

Conclusion: 通过“公平游戏”框架，可以在机器学习系统的部署前后实现公平目标的动态适应，填补了现有公平机器学习技术在动态环境中的不足。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

Motivation: 传统的最坏情况分析方法无法反映多胜者投票规则在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 通过数据驱动的方法，分析不同偏好分布下多胜者投票规则与公理性能之间的关系，并利用神经网络作为新的投票规则进行比较。

Result: 神经网络可以在最小化公理违背方面优于传统规则。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的方法可用于设计新的投票系统，并促进社会选择领域的研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.

TL;DR: 提出了SCAR框架，通过状态空间压缩和强化学习改善6G车载网络资源管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对传统无线电资源管理技术在处理复杂数据（如车辆CQI）时的不足。

Method: 利用ML方法压缩CQI数据并借助6G强化学习策略优化调度和公平性。

Result: SCAR相比无CQI压缩的RL算法提升调度区域时间14%，减少不公平调度时间15%，并通过SAST方法降低CQI失真10%。

Conclusion: SCAR框架在动态车载网络中具有显著的可扩展性和公平性优势。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment
services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource
Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity
of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To
address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource
Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and
fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression
techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while
preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train
6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while
meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR
increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair
scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression.
Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based
clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its
efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits
for dynamic vehicular networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SE-VAE，一种在变分自编码器设计中嵌入测量结构的新架构，旨在从表格数据中学习可解释的潜在表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成建模在表格数据中学习可解释的潜在表示仍存在挑战，SE-VAE旨在解决这一问题，通过结构方程建模对潜在子空间进行对齐，并引入全局错误变量以隔离特定变量的变化。

Method: SE-VAE基于结构方程模型设计，采用模块化架构，通过设计而非统计正则化实现解耦。这种架构包含与已知指标分组对齐的潜在子空间和一个隔离混杂变化的全局潜变量。

Result: 在模拟数据集和主流基准测试中的实验表明，SE-VAE相较其他方法在因子识别、可解释性以及对混杂变化的鲁棒性等方面表现更好。

Conclusion: SE-VAE通过设计来实现解耦，为科学与社会领域中具有理论驱动和测量有效性的潜在结构提供了一种白盒生成建模的有效框架。

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a
challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural
Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement
structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by
structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known
indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate
construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables
disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers
alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and
benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard
disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor
recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation
results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization
strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled
framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains
where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is
essential.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将因果环图（CLDs）转化为探索性系统动力学模型（SDMs）的方法，用于动态分析和干预策略研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果环图（CLDs）虽然常用于复杂健康和环境问题的因果结构表示，但其定性和静态特性限制了对动态分析与干预策略的支持。现有的定量CLD分析方法如网络中心性分析易产生错误推论，需要新的方法填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D) 方法，通过最少的用户输入，将CLDs中变量分为库存（stocks）、流量/辅助变量（flows/auxiliaries）和常数（constants），并利用CLDs的结构信息（链接的存在与极性）构建无数据的探索性系统动力学模型（SDMs）。

Result: D2D 方法能够区分高低杠杆点，并与基于数据的SDM模型相比表现出更高的一致性，同时提供不确定性评估与数据收集指导。

Conclusion: D2D 方法为研究CLDs的动态建模和干预支持提供了工具，尤其通过开源Python包和网络应用降低了动态建模的门槛，具有广泛的应用潜力，未来验证有望进一步扩展其实用性。

Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental
research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex
problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited
in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention
strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network
centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose
Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory
system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal
user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,
flows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information
already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate
hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under
uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and
low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed
from the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with
the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing
uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is
implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to
support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for
researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further
establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在物理学中基于图神经网络探索跨领域关系的潜力，并提供了新的数据集和假设生成方式。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for representing and analyzing
physical laws as a weighted knowledge graph. We constructed a database of 659
distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve
notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics
equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical
concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.
These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable
overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph
Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC
of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming
both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN
architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing
confirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement
over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model
autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics,
identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical
Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical
bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable,
computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying
both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further
theoretical investigation. The framework can generate hundreds of such
hypotheses, enabling the creation of specialized datasets for targeted analysis
of specific physics subfields. Code and data available at

TL;DR: 本文提出一种利用神经网络学习非线性状态空间模型中的nudging项的方法，并通过理论分析和多种混沌系统的实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非线性状态空间模型中，很难设计有效的nudging项以使系统动态与真实轨迹保持一致。为解决此问题，作者探索使用数据驱动的方式来设计这些控制项。

Method: 本文结合Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger观察器理论，设计了一种基于神经网络的nudging方法，用于学习非线性系统中的控制项。具体实现通过在训练阶段模拟真实数据后优化神经网络参数以生成nudging项。

Result: 方法在三个具有混沌特性的基准案例——Lorenz 96模型、Kuramoto--Sivashinsky方程和Kolmogorov流中进行了验证，结果表明该方法能够有效提升系统模型对真实轨迹的逼近能力。

Conclusion: 神经网络nudging方法为非线性状态空间模型提供了一种新的数据驱动解决方案，理论和实验结果证明其在复杂动态系统中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Nudging is an empirical data assimilation technique that incorporates an
observation-driven control term into the model dynamics. The trajectory of the
nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the
initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms
can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging
terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this
work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning
nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical
existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.
The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit
chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and
the Kolmogorov flow.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在实际条件下能够快速推导出可信拓扑，既不受数据质量影响又遵循物理约束，表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid
operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources
with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in
collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework
that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating
heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally
governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical
infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the
system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly
leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent
reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data
quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware
inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect
inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for
operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled
with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational
constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology
requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components
ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,
enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under
real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using
data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,
demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial
improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to
baseline methods.

Abstract: Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and
compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and
measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable
success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts
where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve
as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex
relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for
analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk
minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We
derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings
for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize
existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward
operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by
conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging,
financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics
via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for
understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific
machine learning problems.

Abstract: Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks
like citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging
due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural
graph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced
domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to
temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph
Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large
language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to
generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then
fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with
structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention
weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention
mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across
the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the
challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a
classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN
baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),
recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through
comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each
component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural
information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node
classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future
research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.

*Francesca Ferrara,Lander W. Schillinger Arana,Florian Dörfler,Sarah H. Q. Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）的框架，用于建模碰撞规避机动（CAM）的决策过程，并通过强化学习策略梯度（RL-PG）算法，利用历史CAM数据训练自主引导策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保证碰撞风险可接受的前提下，该方法希望通过提前决策机动，降低CAM的平均燃料消耗。

Method: 本文将CAM建模为连续状态、离散动作和有限时间的MDP模型，决策关键在于确定何时启动机动，并结合了碰撞风险、燃料消耗及轨道几何的分析模型，通过RL-PG算法训练引导策略。

Result: 在合成碰撞事件中，训练策略显著降低了整体和平均燃料消耗；在历史碰撞事件中，虽然总燃料消耗略高，但平均每次CAM的燃料消耗得到了降低。两种情况下，碰撞风险控制效果均满足或优于传统策略。

Conclusion: 训练策略能够以更加高效的方式平衡碰撞风险和燃料消耗，展示了MDP框架和RL-PG算法的优势及实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model
decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement
learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance
policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision
risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by
making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete
action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when
to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for
conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The
Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the
reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which
increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked
conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation
study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction
events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average
propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy
that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On
historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant
overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both
historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal
if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.

Result: 研究结果表明，与未量化的替代方法相比，SZT可能改进了信息密度。

Conclusion: 通过对SZT的引入和分析，证明在固定的资源预算下，量化可以是一种优化工具，而非简单的质量与性能的妥协。

Abstract: Quantization is usually regarded as a means to trade quality of performance
for reduced compute requirements, i.e., as a suboptimal approximation. However,
if examined in terms of a fixed overall resource budget, a very different
perspective arises. We introduce Signed-Zero Ternary (SZT), a 2-bit
quantization that deterministically provides gradient information with no
forward-path penalty. Our analysis provides evidence that it may improve
information density compared to non-quantized alternatives.

Abstract: The research paper addresses decomposition of a stochastic time series into
three time series representing a dual signal i.e., the mean and the dispersion,
with noise isolated. Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit
a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises
between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the
dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order
derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the
regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on
Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be
applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time
series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a
denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been
considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal
first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.
Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with
heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear
unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have
sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function
hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic
process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the
hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states
by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be
represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast
both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time
series.

Motivation: 现有的神经PDE求解器在多保真度和刚性问题中容易因优化不良而失效，需提高其训练的可行性和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出一种解决科学神经求解器中条件差的问题，证明简单的架构调整可以大幅度提升性能，非网络深度才是主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited
expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning,
especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in
Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural
PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can
produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting
convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective
activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while
preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers
in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude,
achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and
fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks
with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not
depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple
architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的群体相对策略优化(GRPO)在面对不平衡响应组时，因噪声奖励信号导致学习过程表现不稳定，急需一种更稳健的方法来优化和稳定训练。

Method: 通过设计噪声感知的权重策略，S-GRPO实现了优化群体奖励信号的方法，从而稳定了训练中的性能表现。

Conclusion: S-GRPO证明了其能有效解决现有GRPO在面对奖励噪声时的表现不稳定问题，有望成为大规模推理模型训练的更高效、稳健方法。

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training
large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the
\emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning
process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups,
paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most
informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal,
noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's
effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly
outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on
Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on
Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn
under 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress.
These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective
training of large-scale reasoning models. \footnote{Code and data are available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多臂老虎机（MAB）的决策树剪枝方法，旨在通过动态和概率的方法优化决策树，提高模型的泛化性能。实验表明，该方法优于传统剪枝技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的决策树剪枝方法，如成本复杂性剪枝(CCP)和减误剪枝(REP)，容易导致过度拟合，尤其是在小型和复杂数据集上。为了克服这一问题，提出新的方法是必要的。

Method: 将剪枝过程建模为探索-利用问题，利用多臂老虎机（MAB）算法，根据每次剪枝动作的反馈选择最优的分支节点进行剪枝，从而实现动态地生成最佳决策树。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，与传统方法相比，该方法能获得更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: MAB方法为决策树剪枝提供了一种动态和概率的新思路，可更好地优化决策树模型，提高其泛化能力。

Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly
complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable
patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in
optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but
also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional
pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning
(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in
performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might
result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust
ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly
when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are
proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate
an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach
assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we
are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on
feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several
benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better
predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the
potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree
pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.

Motivation: 离线强化学习需要从静态数据集中学习最优策略，而不需与环境进一步交互，挑战在于分布漂移导致价值函数过估问题和模型保守性与性能提升的权衡问题。

Method: 研究者提出了MCRQ算法，通过MCRE框架将TD误差与行为克隆项结合到Bellman更新中，在此基础上与非策略演员-评论家框架相结合。

Result: 实验表明，MCRQ算法在基准数据集上优于强基线和最新的离线强化学习算法。

Conclusion: MCRQ算法有效缓解了价值函数过保守引起的性能限制，在实现保守与性能的平衡上取得了关键进展。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from
static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the
distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross
overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive
conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose
the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances
conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a
behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the
mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates
MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ
outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on
benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 研究展示了语言嵌入空间与传统欧式空间的关联，为自然语言目标与强化学习的结合提供新的可能性，并促进了语言模型与控制任务的协作。

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward
functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in
environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward
functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual
engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically
aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning
the current state with a target semantic instruction using a
Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT).
Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives
feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal
textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated
our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide
learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of
hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the
language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework
opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and
lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models
(LLMs) and fluid control applications.

Motivation: 目前利用Polyak–Ruppert均值来达到非线性固定点方程算法的最优收敛率仍未解决，原因是这些半范数通常是非单调的。

Method: 通过将误差转化为包含非线性扰动的线性递归，并结合半范数的收缩性和诱导范数的单调性，抑制非线性。

Result: 首次实现了平均回报和指数折扣设置下$Q$-学习的无参数$	ilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$的最优收敛率，适用于同步和异步更新、单代理和分布式部署，以及从模拟器或马尔科夫轨迹中获得的数据流。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出新的分析框架解决了现有的理论空白，是$Q$-学习研究领域的重要贡献。

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as
average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve
semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for
these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due
to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting
the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation,
and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with
the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first
parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both
average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the
iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates
synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments,
and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian
trajectories.

Motivation: 当前大规模推理模型在代码推理中展现了很强的能力，但过长的推理链导致训练成本和部署可行性上的挑战，因此需要更高效的推理链压缩方法。

Conclusion: ASAP不仅提高了代码推理的效率，还保持了高准确率，为构建高效的大规模推理模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial
challenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment
feasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address
this challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often
disrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on
perplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In
this paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel
coarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided
pruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the
search space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning
by selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token
surprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and
leverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in
coding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing
training and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark,
our approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5%
compared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of
36.19% in Pass@1. Our results highlight a promising direction for building
powerful and efficient LRMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often
degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent
work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet
existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for
optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In
this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that
formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS.
Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of
improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network
optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the
success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results
with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward
and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of
attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline
methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining
symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex
domains.

Abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical
challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical
information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.
Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are
collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU
admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic
data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as
two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel
stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of
neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of
time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).
Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying
hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this
information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient
over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our
approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two
phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear
feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose
post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance
for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,
and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two
phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic
prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly
collected features significantly improve prediction.

Method: 提出了一种自适应异构图神经网络（AHGNN），通过异质性感知卷积机制分析跳数和元路径的异质性分布，同时引入由粗到细的注意力机制在多语义空间中提取有用信息并过滤噪声。

Result: 在七个实际图数据集和二十个基准方法的对比实验中，AHGNN表现出优越性能，特别是在高异质性环境中优势明显。

Conclusion: AHGNN能够有效解决异构异质图建模中的关键挑战，并在多种实际应用场景中显著提升性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often
exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either
heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of
heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their
performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in
modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and
meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of
semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive
Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN
employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily
distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages
from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which
filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven
real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of
AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.

### [193] [DP-LLM: Runtime Model Adaptation with Dynamic Layer-wise Precision Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06041)
*Sangwoo Kwon,Seong Hoon Seo,Jae W. Lee,Yeonhong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了DP-LLM，一个动态为每层分配精度的机制，通过引入精度选择器来在模型运行时确定bit宽度，从而实现更优的性能与延时权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对运行时延迟和精度等需求对设备端大型语言模型(LLM)提出的挑战。

Method: 通过引入多模型变体的多尺度量化，结合动态分层精度分配机制（DP-LLM），在每层线性层中加入精度选择器，该选择器通过轻量级的误差估计器和通过微调学习的阈值来确定bit宽度。

Result: 实验表明，DP-LLM在多个模型和基准测试中的性能延时权衡优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: DP-LLM能够动态适应输入情况，从而在保持运行效率的同时优化模型性能，具有显著优势。

Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models
(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?
Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient
runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model
variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question
still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a
target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,
we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of
each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this
insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns
precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear
layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at
runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned
through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks
demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off,
outperforming prior approaches.

*Barak Gahtan,Alex M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了深度时间模型（如TCNs）在顺序数据上的推广性问题，首次提供基于架构的非空理论界限和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度时间模型在顺序数据预测中表现优秀，但其理论推广性理解有限。研究旨在弥补这个空白。

Method: 通过推导非空泛的推广界限，并提出延迟反馈阻断机制，将依赖样本转化为实际独立样本。此外，提出了一种公平比较方法以分析时间结构对学习的影响。

Result: 对于指数β混合序列，得到了与深度（D）呈根号比例缩放的界限，并发现时间依赖性可以在固定信息预算下提升学习效果，即高依赖性下的广义泛化误差减少。同时，发现实际结果与理论预测可能存在差异。

Conclusion: 时间依赖性可能在固定信息预算下增强学习效果，但理论与实践的差距仍需探索，激励了未来的研究。

Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical
understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by
providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds
for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $
O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network
depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our
delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into
effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data,
yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling
depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective
sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information
content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences
($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly
dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is
purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak
dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies
follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$.
These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed
information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that
motivate future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hindsight Goal-conditioned Regularization (HGR)的技术，结合Hindsight Self-Imitation Regularization (HSR)，以提高稀疏奖励目标导向强化学习的采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前目标导向强化学习在面对稀疏奖励时，使用回顾经验重放（HER）存在采样效率不足的问题，亟需改进其对经验的利用方式。

Method: 提出HGR技术，通过基于后验目标生成动作正则化先验，并结合HSR实现经验的最大化利用。

Result: 实验表明，与现存方法相比，使用HGR和HSR的算法在导航和操作任务中显示了更高的采样效率和最佳表现。

Conclusion: 通过结合HGR与HSR，显著提升了稀疏奖励目标导向强化学习的样本利用效率，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a
fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience
replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with
achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully
exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in
limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned
Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors
based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation
regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize
experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and
self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially
more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically
demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了合成图像生成在医学诊断中的潜力，同时为将此方法扩展至其他类型癌症诊断的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets
frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to
the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these
challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy
by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique
with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from
multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method
generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to
actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic
image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research
into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RR-Cluster的技术，旨在解决在联邦聚类中应用差分隐私机制时效用下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何同时实现联邦聚类的个性化模型效果和差分隐私保护，加强对潜在隐私泄露的防护。

Method: 通过随机重新平衡的方式调整每个聚类的客户端分配数量，减少隐私噪声，从而保证每个聚类中都有足够数量的客户端，同时分析误差和收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，将RR-Cluster应用到现有的强联邦聚类算法中能够显著改善隐私和效用的权衡，在模拟和真实数据集上均有优秀表现。

Conclusion: RR-Cluster是一种轻量级且高效的技术，改善了联邦聚类在差分隐私保护下的实用性表现，是实现隐私保护和模型性能的有力补充。

Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce
one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves
model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients,
but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level
differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade
the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due
to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following
standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same
clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective
technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to
many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise
via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of
clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased
privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect
assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we
demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms
results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 评估当前用于分子化学的预训练神经网络模型的实际效果，并测试其是否真正优于传统方法。

Method: 通过公平的比较框架和分层贝叶斯统计测试，对25个数据集上的25种模型进行性能评估，涵盖多种模态、架构和预训练策略。

Result: 几乎所有神经网络模型的性能与传统的ECFP分子指纹方法无显著差异，只有CLAMP模型表现出了统计学上显著优势。

Conclusion: 现有研究在模型评估方面的严谨性值得商榷，提出了潜在问题解释、解决方案以及具体的改进建议。

Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry
and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used
for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning
in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of
such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair
comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities,
architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical
Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly
all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP
molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular
fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the
alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in
existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer
practical recommendations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的联邦推荐系统（GFed-PP），结合公共用户数据和轻量级图卷积网络，提升推荐性能的同时保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统假设所有用户均有相同的隐私保护需求，但现实应用中用户存在隐私和公开两种数据共享需求，因此需要研发兼容不同隐私需求的推荐框架。

Method: 提出GFed-PP模型，利用公共用户数据构建用户-项目交互图和用户关系图；使用轻量级图卷积网络学习个性化嵌入；在客户端实现用户嵌入和评分函数的本地学习；通过初始化项目嵌入和服务器聚合用户关系图实现框架优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，GFed-PP在五个数据集上显著优于现有方法，具有更高的推荐精度且未损害用户隐私。

Conclusion: GFed-PP框架为具有不同隐私选择的用户提供了兼顾隐私保护和推荐性能的实际解决方案。

Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention
for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing
FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy
protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches
overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing
publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to
be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while
public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper
proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy
Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while
improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data
of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to
form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)
is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To
protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring
function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated
recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on
clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms
existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy
without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for
accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.

Conclusion: RPO 通过稳定样本重用和有效的目标函数优化，克服了现有重参数化策略梯度方法的不足，为解决强化学习难题提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample
efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier
is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the
learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample
reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this
surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is
non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the
reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed
efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we
propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and
sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample
reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being
further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and
remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We
evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and
strong performance.

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several measures include lockdowns,
rapid vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. These
interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current
research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through
round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand
individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the
number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We
address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual)
epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective
optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a
minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for
economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly),
results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced
health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is
needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol 在提升分子属性预测的同时增强了解释性与性能，展现了 LLM 在科学计算领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

Motivation: 解决现有会员推断方法对目标样本特征完全可见假设的局限性，扩展至仅观察部分特征信息情况下的应用。

Method: 提出MRAD攻击框架，包括两个阶段：1. 利用记忆引导优化未知特征的值以减小样本损失；2. 使用异常检测衡量重建样本与训练分布间的偏差。

Result: 实验证明，MRAD在多数据集下效果显著，对各种现成异常检测技术具有兼容性。例如，在STL-10数据集上，当缺失40%的特征时，攻击AUC达到0.6。

Conclusion: MRAD框架拓展了会员推断的适用范围，对于特征信息部分缺失的场景同样具有有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership
inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears
in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume
that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This
assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only
partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability
of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the
adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer
whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target
model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).
To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and
Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD
optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the
second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and
the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results
demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains
compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For
example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of
the missing features.

Conclusion: CMOSS算法在理论遗憾上接近最优，并且在实际应用中表现出计算效率与性能的双重优势，因此是一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential
decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and
adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online
mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer
from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons,
while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant
computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the
Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS
is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent
regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where
$m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible
action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and
matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to
$O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also
applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in
both regret and runtime efficiency.

for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a
small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the
target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a
fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly
misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data
alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against
EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We
investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence
regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature
space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving
of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning
dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across
four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on
benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent
misalignment research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据稀缺、隐私约束以及多样化数据需求的挑战，同时在数据生成中保持高质量和隐私保护。

Method: 采用基于矩阵积状态（MPS）的生成模型；通过在训练期间引入噪声注入和梯度裁剪，实现Rényi差分隐私；进行数据保真实验和任务下游测试比较。

Result: 在隐私要求严格的情况下，MPS模型在数据保真度和任务性能上优于现有模型（如CTGAN、VAE和PrivBayes）。

Conclusion: MPS被证明是隐私感知的合成数据生成中的有前景工具。利用张量网络表达能力与正式隐私机制相结合，为高质量机密数据共享提供了一种可扩展且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial
intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for
diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method
for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using
Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the
MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE,
and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities.
To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient
clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential
Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and
downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS
outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints.
This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data
generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations
with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable
and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design
facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and
confidentiality are critical.

Conclusion: GTMancer为多组学整合与癌症亚型分类提供了新的方法，捕捉细微的异质性，具有优秀的应用潜力。

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a
comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying
various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in
biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer
subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate
coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle
cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics
Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN
optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data.
Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics
data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization
problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients
to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This
approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the
representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world
cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Conclusion: OM2P是首个成功将均值流模型引入离线多智能体强化学习的算法，为协作多智能体场景中生成策略的实际应用和可扩展性提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been
promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating
powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In
particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling
efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical
in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these
difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel
offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To
address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization,
we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a
carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision.
Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a
derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve
training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo
benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a
3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time.
Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model
into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative
policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将持续学习（Continual Learning, CL）应用于印度语言的自动语音识别（ASR），采用Conformer模型并结合三种CL策略（EWC, MAS, LwF），实验结果表明CL对减轻遗忘效果显著，代码已发布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多语言ASR模型需要同时访问所有语言数据，这在数据逐步到达且存在隐私限制的情况下并不实际。为此，本文采用持续学习以实现对印度语言的逐步学习，避免遗忘。

Method: 使用基于Conformer的混合RNN-T/CTC模型，针对以印地语为起点，再序列化地学习8种印度语言的任务，采用三种CL策略（EWC, MAS, LwF）并评估多轮训练以及不同数据质量的WER表现和知识保留能力。

Result: 相较于直接微调，CL策略显著减少了遗忘问题，并且在隐私限制的情境下为印度语言的可扩展ASR提供了潜力解决方法。

Conclusion: CL在隐私保护和逐步数据到达的限制条件下表现出色，在印度语言的ASR场景中展示了有效性及实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing
inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual
models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical
due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual
Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages
sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.
This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the
IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,
initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight
additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We
evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,
privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate
(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as
knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of
varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,
compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating
forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian
languages under realistic constraints. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 所提出的模型通过重置机制在不稳定性条件下实现了学习能力，超越了当前深度状态空间模型在稳定性上的限制。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an emerging technology enabling low-latency and
energy-efficient signal processing. A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic
computing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired
neural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data
processing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,
deep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep
SSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal
modeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions
and no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent
deep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that
combines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback
mechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our
proposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking
function, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on
various tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a
sequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves
performance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our
results illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability
and enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,
allowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in
recent deep SSM models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经场学习需要大量训练数据和计算能力，在资源有限的边缘设备上难以实现，同时现有的联邦元学习方法又存在隐私泄露问题。

Method: FedMeNF提出了一种新的隐私保护损失函数，在本地元优化过程中降低隐私泄露风险，实现快速优化且无需保留用户的私有数据。

Result: FedMeNF在少样本或非独立同分布的数据下表现出快速优化速度和稳健的重建性能，并且适用于多种数据模态，同时保护客户数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedMeNF能在多模态和复杂场景中高效地处理神经场优化问题，平衡了隐私保护和性能需求。

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无需预训练伙伴或手动调整参数即可生成有效训练伙伴的问题，以应对即席团队合作中的挑战。

Method: 通过随机混合自我代理和随机行为生成多样性伙伴，并使用基于方差的可学习性指标来构建动态伙伴课程，同时结合无监督环境设计。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI和Overcooked Generalisation Challenge上的大规模评估中，验证了UPD的动态课程优越性，其表现超过多种基线方法和对照实验。用户研究进一步证明了其为更好的协作者和更接近人类的适应性。

Conclusion: UPD作为一种无需人口的动态框架，成功提升了多智能体协作能力，并拥有显著的实用性和优越性。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free,
multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that
adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or
manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically
mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them
using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the
ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with
unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully
unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a
cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the
Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner
curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both
population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user
study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and
was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better
collaborator, and less frustrating.

### [214] [Introducing Fractional Classification Loss for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06346)
*Mert Can Kurucu,Tufan Kumbasar,İbrahim Eksin,Müjde Güzelkaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的鲁棒损失函数Fractional Classification Loss (FCL)，可以自适应处理标签噪声问题，同时减少对超参数调整的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习中，标签噪声是常见问题，但现有鲁棒损失函数方法往往需要复杂的超参数调整，因此需要一种自动化、鲁棒性更强的解决方案。

Method: FCL引入了交叉熵损失的分数阶导数作为主动分量，并结合均值绝对误差（MAE）作为被动分量，将分数阶导数的阶数μ作为可学习参数，动态调整鲁棒性与收敛速度之间的平衡。

Result: FCL可动态调整其损失函数形状以实现有效的分类性能，在多个基准数据集上取得了最新的最优结果，并且无需手动调节超参数。

Conclusion: FCL通过引入可学习的分数阶导数，实现了鲁棒性和快速收敛之间的精确平衡，是解决标签噪声问题的一种高效、自动化的强大工具。

Abstract: Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the
presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive,
dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional
Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically
calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the
active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that
the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that
interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.
Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a
learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off
between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property
establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$:
lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but
impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in
them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve
effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without
the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Geometric-k-means（简称Gk-means）的新方法，通过几何原理显著提高经典k-means算法的效率与能量经济性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-means算法尽管在机器学习中被广泛应用，但存在效率与能耗瓶颈，作者旨在通过几何方法克服这一难题。

Method: Gk-means利用几何投影原理区分高表达数据（HE）与低表达数据（LE），专注于对聚类更新影响最大的HE数据，从而优化计算过程。

Result: 通过实验验证，在运行时间与距离计算上，Gk-means相比传统及最新的k-means变体都表现更优，且能耗更低。

Conclusion: Gk-means是一种高效且可持续的k-means改进版，适合高维、大规模数据集的使用。

Abstract: This paper introduces Geometric-k-means (or Gk-means for short), a novel
approach that significantly enhances the efficiency and energy economy of the
widely utilized k-means algorithm, which, despite its inception over five
decades ago, remains a cornerstone in machine learning applications. The
essence of Gk-means lies in its active utilization of geometric principles,
specifically scalar projection, to significantly accelerate the algorithm
without sacrificing solution quality. This geometric strategy enables a more
discerning focus on data points that are most likely to influence cluster
updates, which we call as high expressive data (HE). In contrast, low
expressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively
bypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead.
Experiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets,
demonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the
art (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC).
Moreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its
reduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在常规场景下的潜在自发性欺骗行为，并提出新的评估框架进行量化分析。测评结果表明，随着任务复杂性增加，LLMs展现出更高的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLMs的研究主要关注其在交互环境下的可靠性，但对模型可能存在的自发性欺骗行为的研究较少，而这种行为可能对关键领域的应用产生重大影响。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于“接触搜索问题”的新框架，通过两个统计指标，即欺骗意图分数和欺骗行为分数，从心理学角度量化LLMs的欺骗倾向。此外，研究还建立了一个数学模型以解释这些行为特征。

Result: 对14种主流LLMs的评估表明，随着任务的难度增加，这些模型的欺骗意图分数和欺骗行为分数同步上升，说明复杂任务可能诱发模型更高的欺骗倾向。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前的LLMs在处理复杂任务时普遍具有更高的欺骗潜力，这为其在关键领域的安全部署提出了挑战，并提示需要进一步的技术改进和监控机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,
planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical
concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately
fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a
significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such
deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or
fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.
Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated
deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this
evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions."
This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological
principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive
Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The
second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's
internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we
find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in
parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a
mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the
most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when
handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM
agents in complex and crucial domains.

Method: 提出了ActivityDiff方法，通过扩散模型中的分类器引导技术，并借助单独训练的药物-靶点分类器，实现对正向和负向行为的调控。

Result: 实验证明ActivityDiff可有效应用于单/双靶点生成、碎片约束的双靶点设计、选择性生成以增强靶点特异性及减少非靶点效应等任务。

Conclusion: ActivityDiff为实现分子活性的综合控制提供了新范式，并为分子设计提供了一个多功能且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing
targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and
off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug
design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing
molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the
simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular
interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the
classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately
trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance,
enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful
off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively
handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation,
fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target
specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety
in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for
achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff
as a versatile and extensible framework.

Motivation: 现有的Text-to-SQL方法依赖于预定义的目标数据库，这在多数据库场景中容易出错，提出更好的解决方案以改善精确度。

Method: 框架分为三阶段：利用LLMs和提示工程从NLQ中提取规则集，基于RoBERTa细调的编码器训练db_id预测模型，最后通过批判代理优化SQL生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在数据库意图预测和SQL生成准确性方面超越了当前的最先进模型。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段框架有效解决了多数据库场景中数据库选择的问题，并显著提高了Text-to-SQL任务的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database
language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases.
Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a
given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation
accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is
pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive
databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet
overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL
framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL
queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit
information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We
then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based
finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on
both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL
by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database
intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法可提供更及时、本地化、经济的信息，为政策制定与干预评估提供了重要支持工具。

Abstract: Homelessness in the United States has surged to levels unseen since the Great
Depression. However, existing methods for monitoring it, such as point-in-time
(PIT) counts, have limitations in terms of frequency, consistency, and spatial
detail. This study proposes a new approach using publicly available,
crowdsourced data, specifically 311 Service Calls and street-level imagery, to
track and forecast homeless tent trends in San Francisco. Our predictive model
captures fine-grained daily and neighborhood-level variations, uncovering
patterns that traditional counts often overlook, such as rapid fluctuations
during the COVID-19 pandemic and spatial shifts in tent locations over time. By
providing more timely, localized, and cost-effective information, this approach
serves as a valuable tool for guiding policy responses and evaluating
interventions aimed at reducing unsheltered homelessness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization
methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However,
these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility
to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy
quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we
introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful
plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based
optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay
number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the
risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a
periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network
plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,
combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further
bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR
significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods
on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative
DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging
math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based
algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,
sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking
greater performance from limited data.

Abstract: The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs)
necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or
unauthorized data. Existing empirical methods often yield incomplete forgetting
or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In
this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM
unlearning. GRIN introduces a novel gradient-ratio-based metric to identify
parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform
selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which
improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we
propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our
approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.

Abstract: Real-world networks often benefit from capturing both local and global
interactions. Inspired by multi-modal analysis in brain imaging, where
structural and functional connectivity offer complementary views of network
organization, we propose a graph neural network framework that generalizes this
approach to other domains. Our method introduces a functional connectivity
block based on persistent graph homology to capture global topological
features. Combined with structural information, this forms a multi-modal
architecture called Functional Connectivity Graph Neural Networks. Experiments
show consistent performance gains over existing methods, demonstrating the
value of brain-inspired representations for graph-level classification across
diverse networks.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of
two-dimensional artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset,
NCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary
often breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain
the expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the
stability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple
constraints during training.
  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with
the original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to
achieve this increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the
stable organisms, with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity
values.
  This work lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between
NCA-grown organisms, paving the way for studying social interaction at a
cellular level in artificial organisms.
